The telnet server running on my windows machine is the Microsoft telnet
server (which comes from windows).

As suggested when I used 'dir', I am able to see the content in lsop.log.
'ls' is an exe that is obtained with some free-ware software. But I don't
see any output if I use 'ls'. But isn't there a way to get the output from
ls???

The reason that I am asking this is that I will have to call one more exe
(similar to ls, obtained from free-ware) for my Perl program and that is not
running either?

Thanks & Regards,
Lakshmi

Try using

$telnet->cmd('dir > lsop.log');

There is no ls command in DOS.
