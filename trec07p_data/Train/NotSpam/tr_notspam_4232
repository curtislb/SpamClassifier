It seems to me that the most importance difference between factors and
character vectors is that factors also store the range of the
variable.  You could imagine doing something similar for continuous
variables.  This would have the interesting property that plots of
subsets would have the same range as plots of the original data.  I'd
imagine, just as with factors, this would be useful and frustrating in
equal parts.

In terms of which should be the default, I can imagine two arguments:

 * keep to the original format of the data as closely as possible:
character vectors should be the default

 * maintain as much information about the original data as possible:
factors should be the default.
