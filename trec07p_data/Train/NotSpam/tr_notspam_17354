We did what we could to support alsa, but support is via alsa's oss.
Can't do anything about that because it's hardcoded into ibmtts, and we
do not have that source code. However, there were problems running with
alsa which were fixed some time ago. It was one of the early issues that
held us up. There have been lots of issues! <grin>

So, bottom line--you should be able to play sounds while running
software speech. However, going back and forth between the desktop and
console with the TTSynth drivers may still be problematical.
Fortunately, now that the product is actually available, we're hoping
this kind of remaining issue will get worked out fairly quickly, as it
doesn't require anything from the actual ibmtts module.
