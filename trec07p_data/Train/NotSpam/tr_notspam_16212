   Just use another mirror to rsync from.  By the way, this is not the 
master server, as you might be thinking.  Right now, It seems there is 
only one mirror associated to ftp.debian.org, but in the recent past there 
was at least 3, and rsyncing from there always had been discouraged 
(because It can leads to many problems if they are not perfectly synced 
together).

   You can probably ask to get access to master.debian.org, or find a good 
mirror (possibly in Brazil, if there is good connectivity between the two 
countries).

   Except for what you reported, gluck.debian.org seems to works properly. 
  My guest is that there was some configuration changes to refuse rsync 
connections from ftp.debian.org and direct IP addresses.

   It seems that there is a rsync://gluck.debian.org, but no modules in 
It. It might be a configuration mistake, or done on purpose, I don't know.
