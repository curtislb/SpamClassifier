nope, sorry, you're wrong.  push() works perfectly well.  It adds
elements to an array.  If your program produced incorrect results, it
is because you did something wrong, not because "push didn't work." Of
course, as you haven't shown any code that produces these undesired
results, we can only guess as to what your actual problem was.

Nope.  If your array is being used in a loop, the contents of that
array are changing when you don't want them to be changing, and
instead want to be creating new arrays, you declared your array in the
wrong scope.

perhaps you should be. . .

You don't even have time to point out what you find to be "wrong" with
them?  But instead you do have time to create examples that you claim
to be in the service of newbies, all the while saying that the docs
are bad?  I'd suggest you could do with attending a few more time-
management seminars.

No sometimes about it.  Every post you've made thus far is
contentious, and so I have answered in kind.
