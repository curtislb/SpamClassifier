Engineers completed rollout preparations over the weekend and now plan to m=
ove the shuttle Atlantis to the launch pad Tuesday, one day ahead of schedu=
le. A powerful crawler-transporter, carrying Atlantis and its mobile launch=
 platform, is scheduled to begin the 3.2-mile trip from the Vehicle Assembl=
y Building to pad 39A at 4 a.m. Tuesday, weather permitting. The forecast c=
alls for lightning and thunderstorms in the area that could cause problems.=
 More of the same is expected Wednesday.

ew to assess the status of ground processing and to set an official launch =
date. Liftoff currently is targeted for 7:37:56 p.m. on June 8. Assuming At=
lantis gets to the pad Tuesday, engineers will have four days of contingenc=
y time between then and June 8 to handle any unexpected problems.
