Good, can we recap a little bit?
As I understand it, the current proposed wording is:

| The work [X] is a trademark, held by [Y], representing [Z].
|
| The Mark Holder hereby licenses you to use the Mark, or a modified
| version thereof, in any way and for any purpose, with the exception of
| the following:
|
| You are not authorized to use the Mark, or a modified version thereof,
| in commerce in any way that is likely to cause confusion, or to cause
| mistake, or to deceive
|
| (1) as to the affiliation, connection, or association of you or your
| product, service or other commercial activity with the Mark Holder, or
|
| (2) as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of your product,
| service or other commercial activity by the Mark Holder
|
| If the Mark qualifies as an original work of authorship under
| copyright law, then it is licensed under the copyright license below,
| but that is not a trademark license and should not be construed as
| one.
|
| [Expat license follows]

I can understand that, but I still think that this issue should be
addressed without mixing copyright and trademark restrictions...

Ah, thanks for the clarification: I didn't understand what you meant.
