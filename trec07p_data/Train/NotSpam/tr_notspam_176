Cool! Can we move this on dev.laptop.org and add it to jhbuild?

I can have a look at it once it's added to the build.

Btw please do not use raw pixels to specify margin, padding etc. You can
use the sugar/graphics/units.py helpers to do conversion from points. A
little annoying but it ensure stuff looks good both in the emulator and
on the XO.

At some point we want to add support for units to HippoCanvas (and a way
to set the canvas zoom factor) to avoid the extra typing.
