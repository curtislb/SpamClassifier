If X is a vector of daily returns (today's close -
yesterday's close) for your index (in dollars) and Y
is the vector of daily returns for your stock (in
dollars), then to hedge 1 share of your stock you need
to hold u = -(1/r)*(Sy/Sx) units of the index, where r
is the correlation coefficient, Sx is the standard
deviation of daily returns of the index and Sy is the
standard deviation of daily returns of Y.
In R,
u <- -(1/cor(X,Y))*(sd(Y)/sd(X))
 
In this case your stock is "fully" hedged by the index
(but the index of course is not "fully" hedged by the
stock, unless the correlation coefficient is +/- 1).

Hope this helps,

Moshe Olshansky.
