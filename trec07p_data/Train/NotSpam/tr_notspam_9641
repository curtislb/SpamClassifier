I think you've got it, except it doesn't stop with the 5. Unless I'm
missing something, that substitution means the same thing as this
simpler one:

    s#(\d)#$1#g

Unless the value of $1 is useful, it's hard to see what good this
does. It replaces each digit with itself. As side effects it affects
all the match variables, and it stringifies its target.

Did you find that piece of code somewhere? Do you know what its author
was trying to do?
