						<div class=3D"GreyHeading">JONATHAN DAVIES ON CHALLENGE CUP 5TH RND</=
div>
						<div><br>The incentive to reach the Challenge Cup final is always imm=
ense, but there is an extra special reason to make it this year.
<br>

<br>
Rugby league's showpiece event returns to Wembley after an eight-year absen=
ce and it will be a very special occasion.
<br>

<br>
Clubs go into this weekend's games knowing they are just three wins away fr=
om stepping out to play at the fantastic new arena on 25 August.
<br>

<br>
On Saturday Leeds take on Wigan and I expect the Rhinos to make their home =
advantage count.
<br>

<br>
Wigan did narrowly win at Headingley in April, but they have been very up a=
nd down this season.=20
<br>

<br>
The Warriors have quality players who can hurt anyone, although I think Lee=
ds are going well enough at the moment to progress.
<br>

<br>
On Sunday, out-of-form Wakefield have to contend with the might of the Brad=
ford Bulls.
<br>

<br>
The Wildcats have taken some heavy beatings recently, losing five out of th=
eir last six games, but in coach John Kear they have a man who can motivate=
 teams for the big matches.
<br>

<br>
It might just take a one-off game such as this cup tie to reinvigorate thei=
r season and get them back into the sort of form we saw at the start of the=
 year.
<br>

<br>
That said, the Bulls will be rampant favourites to progress as they are suc=
h a strong unit.
<br>

<br>
In fact I would probably have them as my favourites to go all the way.
<br>

<br>
They won't have it easy as the way the draw has fallen this year has seen m=
any of the Super League big guns kept apart.
<br>

<br>
If this weekend's games go to form we should have seven out of the current =
top eight teams in the league contesting the quarter-finals and that is exa=
ctly what we want and expect at this stage of the competition.
<br>
