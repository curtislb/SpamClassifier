US hands back artefacts to Peru  
By Will Grant 
BBC News, Miami  

 
The items are thought to be worth millions of dollars 

The US has handed over more than 400 Incan and pre-Columbian artefacts to
the government of Peru.

The items, which are believed to be worth millions of dollars, had been
stolen from several Andean nations. 

They include a cape made from macaw and parrot feathers, gold and silver
jewellery and a clay vessel believed to be more than 3,500 years old. 

The artefacts had been stolen from South America by grave robbers and came
into the US via the black market. 

Accounting system 

The Peruvian consul general in Miami, Jorge Roman, described some of the
most important items. 

"The pieces of greatest historical value were perhaps the two quipus. 

"The ancient civilisations of Peru used these cords as an accounting system
- to keep a record of the size of their harvests, of their potato crops,
perhaps of the number of men and women in a town. 

"But when the Spaniards arrived, they viewed it as a pagan system and most
quipus were destroyed or burned. So, it's very rare to see them in a
museum." 

An Italian man was arrested two years ago for bringing the artefacts into
the United States. 

After serving 17 months in a federal prison, he is now due to be deported. 

Mr Roman says that as well as returning the artefacts to their countries of
origin, this move sends an important message to other tomb raiders and
archaeological thieves that there is an international agreement in place to
tackle their crimes.

Getty Museum's Brand Faces Impasse in Italian Artifacts Dispute 

By Stephen West

June 14 (Bloomberg) -- Michael Brand, director of the J. Paul Getty Museum
in Los Angeles, has a problem that won't go away: a dispute with the Italian
government over ancient artworks in the museum's collection. Once-promising
negotiations have completely broken down. 

In the 18 months that Brand has led the museum, he's strengthened its
acquisition policy, hired several key staff members and helped organize new
shows. He also helped repair the museum's reputation and that of the parent
Getty Trust, the world's richest art institution with a $5.6 billion
endowment. 

The trust last year settled an investigation by the California attorney
general into the Getty's governance. Brand struck an agreement with the
Greek government over disputed antiquities, returning four objects this
year, and was making progress in talks with Italy's Ministry of Culture over
52 disputed works. 

``Everything was going along fine -- which isn't to say it was easy, but we
knew what we agreed on and what we had yet to reach agreement on,'' Brand
recalled in an interview. ``And then last November they placed a new
condition on the table, that without the Getty Bronze there would be no
agreement at all.'' 

The Getty Bronze, or ``Statue of a Victorious Youth,'' is a life-size Greek
sculpture of a muscular nude athlete made between 300 B.C. and 100 B.C. that
the museum acquired in 1977 for $3.95 million. It's a highlight of the
collection, displayed in a special room of its own at the Getty Villa in
Malibu. 

International Waters 

The museum's position is that the statue was made in Greece, looted by the
Romans about 2,000 years ago and lost at sea. It was then discovered in
1964, in international waters of the Aegean Sea, by Italian fishermen who
brought it ashore and quickly sold the heavily encrusted work to a local art
dealer. After it was sold a second time the next year, the sculpture was
shipped out of the country and eventually ended up with a Munich art dealer
who sold the piece to the Getty. 

In 1965, Italian authorities charged the first dealer and three others with
theft and illegal sale of state property, claiming the work was part of
Italy's cultural heritage. A court in Perugia ruled the next year that the
prosecution didn't prove its case, especially that the statue was found in
Italian waters and thus was state property. The decision was upheld on
appeal. 

``We acquired the object after those two cases,'' Brand said. ``At the time,
the Italian Ministry of Culture made no claim on the object and made no
claim on it after we acquired it.'' More investigations by the Italians in
the 1970s and '80s failed to come up with clear proof that the statue was
state property. 

`Domestic Politics' 

Yet the controversy wouldn't die. In 1995, Italian authorities approached
Marion True, then the Getty's curator of antiquities, seeking the return of
the ``Victorious Youth.'' The museum maintained its position that Italy had
no valid claim. Still, Italian newspapers continued to report on the case. 

``It's fair to say that the status of that object has entered the realm of
domestic politics, for whatever reasons,'' Brand said. ``Which, of course,
makes it harder for us, because that's nothing we can deal with.'' 

The Italian position is that the Getty has completely missed the point:
Museums shouldn't buy and display smuggled art. The bronze should be
considered illicitly trafficked because none of the people who bought and
sold it ever declared the statue's export from Italy, as required by law,
Minister of Culture Francesco Rutelli said. 

``We're not talking about legal issues; we're talking about moral issues,''
Rutelli said at a Nov. 23 news conference in Rome, where he outlined the
government's decision to hold out for the bronze. ``Can a great
international museum exhibit to the public objects that are undoubtedly
trafficked?'' 

Narrow Issue 

He said the Getty should know better than to base its claim on court cases
that addressed only the narrow issue of whether the statue had been found in
Italian waters -- and not other potential crimes, such as illegal export.
While the rulings said there wasn't enough proof to show the bronze was
discovered in Italian waters, that's a far cry from saying it was certainly
found in international waters, Rutelli said. 

``The athlete was found by fishermen off the coast of Italy, and then taken
to Italy, then hidden in Italy and then trafficked from Italy,'' Rutelli
said. 

``There are two possibilities, that it was sold legally or not,'' he said.
``It was clandestinely exported from this country.'' 

After the U.S. and Italy signed a cultural treaty in 2001 that required the
U.S. to return artifacts illegally exported after that year, the Italian
government targeted antiquities in several U.S. collections, including the
Getty, New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art and Boston's Museum of Fine
Arts. 

Curator on Trial 

Italy also charged two art dealers and former curator True with buying
looted artifacts. One dealer has been convicted and the other remains on
trial in Rome with True, who denies the charges. True resigned her position
at the museum in 2005 after an unrelated ethics scandal related to a
personal loan. The Getty continues to pay her legal bills for the Rome
trial. 

When the Australian-born, Harvard-educated Brand arrived at the Getty in
late 2005, after serving as director of the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, he
quickly sought to resolve the disputes with both the Greek and Italian
governments. Among the 52 objects sought by Italy was another of the
museum's most important works, a marble and limestone sculpture of a goddess
in flowing robes popularly known as the Aphrodite, which the Getty bought in
1988 from a London dealer for $18 million. 

Partial Deal 

By last October, before talks broke down, the Getty had agreed in principle
to return 26 objects and Italy had agreed to drop its claim to six others.
Ownership of the remaining artworks, including the Aphrodite, was still to
be resolved. 

Since then the Getty has dropped its resistance to returning the Aphrodite,
and last month it conducted a scholarly workshop on the origins of the
sculpture. While the study yielded no definitive answers, it reinforced the
museum's view that the statue came from southern Italy or Sicily. 

``We acknowledge that the Italian claim is a serious claim,'' Brand said in
an interview after the workshop. ``We have doubts about what we've been told
about the provenance.'' 

Brand repeated an earlier offer to transfer title to the Aphrodite
immediately and physically return the object to Italy within a year, after
completing study of it. Yet Italy's Ministry of Culture declined to
participate in the workshop and hasn't responded to Brand's offer to
transfer title. (The Sicilian Ministry of Culture sent a representative to
the workshop.) 

``We've seen some reports that imply that this is a delaying tactic,'' Brand
said. ``This is absolutely not a delaying tactic. The object could already
have a label saying `Property of the republic of Italy, on loan to the
Getty.''' 

Impasse 

At this point, the dispute all comes back to the Getty Bronze, an issue that
Brand says is beyond his control. 

``This is really something, in the end, that the Italian side has to
resolve, because I can't recommend to our board of trustees to return that
object because we don't believe there is any reason to do so. We have
presented that information to the Italians. It is up to them to find some
way through that impasse.'' 

Italy still insists that any agreement include the Getty Bronze, said
Maurizio Fiorilli, a government lawyer who represents the Ministry of
Culture in negotiations with museums. 

``No matter what location it was fished from, it was a work that entered
Italy and should have been declared to customs. This piece should be
confiscated,'' Fiorilli said last month. ``The Getty knows this very well.''


Possible Boycott 

Brand says an agreement with the minister of culture is still possible, and
so far the disagreement hasn't broadened into an outright cultural boycott. 

``The good news is that we've had confirmation from Minister Rutelli's
office that, for the moment, it should be business as usual,'' Brand said.
``They ask for loans from us, we ask for loans from them. It remains to be
seen whether the loans actually take place. We are hoping they will; we've
been told they will go ahead. Our foundation is still working on projects in
Italy. The Getty Conservation Institute is still planning projects with
Italian colleagues.'' 

Yet he's concerned that business as usual ``might not last forever. I'm just
hoping that reason will prevail. I just hope that, in this day and age, the
talk of cultural embargoes really hasn't any place. What would a boycott
mean? That Italians aren't able to access Getty databases? That Getty books
can't be sold in Italy? It harms exhibitions. There must be better ways of
dealing with this,'' he said, shaking his head. 

``We remain absolutely ready to talk anytime if there's something
constructive to talk about. There are other objects that we haven't reached
agreement on yet, and we're perfectly happy to talk about them.''

NSW gallery defends security system after theft of 17th century artwork

++++++++++++++++++

Moderator's comment:

How can one defend security when a million dollar painting has been stolen
during opening hours? There was no CCTV in the gallery, and no guard
present. There was no detection system attached to the painting, and it has
taken five days for the theft to become public. Still the director is
convinced his security system is second to none. What this director should
say is that the security system apparently has shortcomings and that
improvements will be considered. The gallery director also 'knows' it was
not inside job. He may be right, but how would he know.
According to the police it was an expert job, but a Bonham's specialist is
convinced the theft was performed by someone with mental problems.

The World Today - Thursday, 14 June , 2007  12:35:00
Reporter: Karen Barlow
ELEANOR HALL: A $1.4-million painting was lifted from the walls of a major
Sydney art gallery on the weekend and police have around 6,000 possible
suspects.

The self-portrait by 17th century Dutch master, Frans van Mieris, was taken
from a room in the Art Gallery of New South Wales on Sunday. 

Police say the theft happened within a two-and-a-half hour window and that
any one of the people attending the gallery that day may have seen something
suspicious.

The Gallery's Director Edmund Capon is adamant the theft is not an inside
job but police say they are pursuing all lines of inquiry. 

In Sydney, Karen Barlow reports.

KAREN BARLOW: Police believe the painting, called A Cavalier - Self
Portrait, was stolen sometime between 10am and 12:30pm on Sunday. 

Acting Superintendent Simon Hardman says the small 16 by 20 centimetre
artwork had to be unscrewed from the wall. 

SIMON HARDMAN: We believe that it was removed expertly from the gallery and
we're currently reviewing CCTV footage.

KAREN BARLOW: Trouble is there was no camera in the painting's room and
according to the Art Gallery of NSW Director, Edmund Capon, no security
guard. 

EDMUND CAPON: The 5-6,000 people who came to the gallery on Sunday might
just have a glimpse of something that might lead to the recovery of the
picture, that would be wonderful.

KAREN BARLOW: Mr Capon has defended the gallery's security system.

EDMUND CAPON: That any public art institution like this, with hundreds and
hundreds of works of art, vulnerable works of art on the wall every day,
one-and-a-quarter, one-and-a-half million people a year coming through
relies on public goodwill to an extraordinary extent. 

The other thing is that we are, we have a record of security, management,
organisation that is second to none. And an incident such as this is
extraordinarily rare. 

KAREN BARLOW: He is also not concerned that it has taken five days for the
theft to become public. 

EDMUND CAPON: That's not to say that nothing's been done. Monday was the
police; secondly, I was away; thirdly I had to speak to the donor; and
fourthly there's a lot of work been done in the last two days, believe me. 

KAREN BARLOW: The van Mieris artwork was a given to the gallery in 1993 by
philanthropist and former publisher, James Fairfax. 

It is one of the smallest paintings in the gallery, which may or may not
have made it a target. 

Edmund Capon is unimpressed.

EDMUND CAPON: How would you feel? It's like the loss of, if you walk home
and find a gap on your wall, that's how I feel. And I don't like gaps on the
wall. 

KAREN BARLOW: Art experts say the distinctiveness of the painting and the
publicity surrounding the theft will make it virtually impossible to resell.

Tim Goodman is the Chief Executive of the auction house, Bonhams and
Goodman.

TIM GOODMAN: It's a unique painting, it's highly specialised, it's an old
master, it's not hugely valuable in terms of major works of this period or
genre. So it is very unlikely that it's going to be offered for sale.

KAREN BARLOW: Mr Goodman says monetary gain is a most unlikely motive.

TIM GOODMAN: I suspect that it's the work of somebody who's possibly has
mental problems. Perhaps they have a vendetta against the gallery or perhaps
even the donor. Who knows? It could be any number of reasons. It might have
been the way the gentleman sitter in the picture looked at the thief.

KAREN BARLOW: The gallery's Director, Edmund Capon rejects any assertion
that any staff member could be the thief but police say they are pursuing
all lines of inquiry. 

The space where the van Mieris went missing has been rehung so there is no
gap on the gallery wall.

ELEANOR HALL: Karen Barlow reporting.

Group identifies most endangered US historic sites
(Reuters)

14 June 2007 



CAROLINA - A 1925 race track that drew the rich and famous to Florida and
the studio of a 95-year-old blacksmith whose ornamental ironwork gave
Charleston, South Carolina, its distinctive look are among the most
endangered US landmarks, a preservation group said on Thursday.


The National Trust for Historic Preservation listed the following sites in
the 20th edition of its annual report on America's most endangered historic
places.

 -- Historic Brooklyn waterfront - Dockyards and factories are being
demolished by developers seeking to cash in on the area's hip status.

 -- El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro National Historic Trail, New Mexico -
The earliest Euro-American trade route in the United States is threatened by
a $225 million commercial spaceport planned near one of its most pristine
segments.

 -- H.H. Richardson House, Brookline, Massachusetts - The home and studio of
19th century American architect Henry Hobson Richardson, who created
Boston's Trinity Church, may be demolished unless a buyer willing to
preserve it is found.

 -- Hialeah Park Race Course, Hialeah, Florida - A 1925 racetrack known for
its Mediterranean architecture and pink flamingos. It drew the likes of
Harry Truman, Winston Churchill and Seabiscuit to Florida. A planned
condominium, retail and office complex would destroy much of the park.

 -- Historic sites in seven states from Virginia to New York are threatened
by a plan to build new high-voltage electric transmission lines through the
region.

 -- Historic structures in Mark Twain National Forest, Missouri - Frontier
farms and New DeAl era fire lookouts and ranger stations in the park are
deteriorating due to Forest Service budget limitations and are threatened
with demolition.

 -- Motels on Route 66 - Motels from Illinois to California - With the road
bypassed by interstate highways, many of the mom-and-pop motels along the
so-called 'mother road' are being torn down for new construction or are
falling victim to the elements.

 -- Minidoka Internment National Monument, Jerome County, Idaho - The camp
where thousands of Japanese-American citizens and immigrants were interned
during the Second World War is routinely looted of artifacts and is
threatened by local land usage, including a huge animal feed operation
nearby.

 -- Philip Simmons' Workshop and Home, Charleston, South Carolina - The
legacy of the 95-year-old master blacksmith, who has spent nearly 80 years
adorning his hometown with intricate iron gates, fences, stair rails and
window grills, is in jeopardy because of a lack of plans to preserve his
home and studio.

 -- Pinon Canyon, Colorado - The Pinon Canyon area of southeastern Colorado
includes scenic buttes, river valleys, family ranches and historic and
archeological sites that span 11,500 years. It is threatened by plans to
expand a neighboring US Army facility.

 -- Stewart's Point Rancheria, Sonoma County, California - The Kashia Pomo
people of northern California are losing their sacred and historic sites to
looters, vandals and the elements because of the federal government's
program to protect tribal historic resources is under-funded.

Switzerland has returned an ancient Greek statue stolen 16 years ago and
recently discovered in the collection of an antiquities dealer.
The recovery of the 1,900-year-old headless marble sculpture comes as Greece
campaigns for the repatriation of illegally exported antiquities.
The Federal Culture Office said the 1.3-metre torso of a young man was
loaded on a plane in Zurich bound for Athens, where it arrived on Thursday.
The Culture Office added that Switzerland was implementing measures to
combat the illegal transfer of cultural goods.
Switzerland has concluded several agreements on the import and repatriation
of cultural heritage with countries including Greece, Italy and Peru.
The Greek culture minister, Giorgos Voulgarakis, said the statue returned
had been stolen from the town of Gortyn on the island of Crete. It was
traced in March to the Swiss city of Basel.

"Today's event is a result of international cooperation to protect our
cultural heritage. More results will be announced soon," Voulgarakis said
after the statue was delivered to the National Archaeological Museum in
Athens.

He said the statue would be returned to Crete at a later date.

 
Elgin marbles
 
The returned statue, possibly the Greek god Apollo, had been registered as
stolen on an international police database. Its location was reported to
Interpol in March by an unknown individual, Yves Fischer of the Swiss
Federal Culture Office told the Associated Press.
Voulgarakis said the Swiss-based antiquities dealer was persuaded by
authorities to surrender the statue and voluntarily drop all claims to it.
Voulgarakis formerly headed a ministry in charge of law enforcement and has
stepped up efforts against the rogue antiquities trade since becoming
culture minister last year.
Recently returned antiquities include sculptures from the J. Paul Getty
Museum in Los Angeles.

Voulgarakis' campaign coincides with the construction of a museum at the
foot of the ancient Acropolis which is due open in early 2008.

The site will be purpose-built to house the Elgin marbles, the Parthenon
sculptures on display at the British Museum in London, if returned.

"The new museum will soon be a reality," Voulgarakis said. "We are striving
for the marbles to be reunited. It would be a shame for such a museum at
such a special site to remain half-empty."

 
CONTEXT
 
In 2005 new legislation came into force bringing Switzerland into line with
the 1970 Unesco Convention against cultural goods trafficking.

The law obliges art dealers and auction houses to identify customers and
foreign owners of stolen artwork now have 30 years to claim it back.

The Federal Culture Office says Switzerland is among the five biggest art
trade hubs, with a market worth SFr1.5 billion ($1.2 billion).

Roban en pinacoteca  
JES?S CORVERA 

Mi?rcoles, 13 de Junio de 2007  
LA PAZ  Cinco pinturas de artistas nacionales fueron sustra?das entre 2004 y
2007 La polic?a no ha recibido denuncias ni Concultura conoce lo ocurrido 


 Cinco pinturas fueron robadas de la pinacoteca Camilo Minero y de la
Biblioteca Sa?l Flores de Zacatecoluca, entre 2004 y 2007. Ni la polic?a ni
las autoridades de la Direcci?n Nacional de Espacios de Desarrollo Cultural
del Consejo Nacional para la Cultura y el Arte (Concultura) conocen del
hecho. 
Manuel Bonilla, Director Nacional de Espacios de Desarrollo Cultural,
expres? que desconoce los robos y que se deben investigar. 

Marcos Palacios, promotor cultural de la Casa de la Cultura de Zacatecoluca,
dijo que tres de estas pinturas fueron sustra?das en 2004 durante la
reconstrucci?n de la biblioteca local que hoy se denomina Biblioteca P?blica
Profesor Sa?l Flores, ubicada en la calle Doctor Nicol?s Pe?a, del Barrio
Candelaria. 

Palacios explic? que Ra?l Bonilla coordinador departamental de las casas de
la cultura de La Paz, luego de la p?rdida de las pinturas inici? un informe
que qued? en el tintero porque enferm? y falleci? en 2006. 

A?adi? que las tres primeras obras hurtadas se denominan "Paisaje de la
ciudad", "Sue?o" y "Las Vegas". 

Las otras dos pinturas, sustra?das de la pinacoteca Camilo Minero entre
marzo y abril de este a?o, se titulan "Paisaje volc?nico" y "Balneario de
Ichanmichen". 

A?adi? que estas obras fueron las ganadoras de los cert?menes de pintura y
dibujo realizados entre 1985 y 1990 en Zacatecoluca. Se desconoce el nombre
de los artistas salvadore?os, porque se perdieron los archivos
correspondientes. 

Wendy Carolina Alonso, como sucesora de Ra?l Bonilla, empez? a elaborar un
reporte del caso, pero se retir? el mes anterior. Tampoco se hizo la
denuncia a la polic?a ni a Concultura. 

Sospechas 

Hern?n Acevedo encargado interino de la Casa de la Cultura de Zacatecoluca
manifest? que posiblemente una misma persona sea la culpable de los robos,
ya que se realizaron de la misma forma. 

El Comit? de Apoyo de la casa de la cultura local sugiere a las autoridades
de Concultura instalar vigilancia privada para evitar detener este abuso. 

Alfredo Herrera expresidente de dicho comit? dijo: "espero que Concultura
denuncie la p?rdida de las pinturas para que las autoridades respectivas
investiguen pronto".

Allegations of art gallery fraud dropped


Settlement says Gypsum woman will pay former employer $20,000


  
Steve Lynn
Vail, CO Colorado
June 14, 2007

EAGLE - Nine felony charges against a former art gallery accused of stealing
art and fraudulently using credit cards were dismissed last week,
authorities said. 

Diane Stockmar, of Gypsum, would pay $20,000 to her former employer though
prosecutors dropped nine felony charges - a count of theft, four counts of
unauthorized use of a transaction device and four counts of criminal
impersonation, said District Attorney Mark Hurlbert. 

"Cases are very fluid - sometimes the evidence gets worse and sometimes the
evidence gets better," Hurlbert said. "The evidence got so bad that we
couldn't prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt." 

Stockmar was accused of failing to pay gallery artists for more than
$100,000 of artwork and impersonating gallery co-owner Adele Arrowsmith to
apply for credit cards for her own use, police said. 

Police began investigating Stockmar in 2002, when the Dragonfly Art Gallery
in Avon went out of business.

The restitution Stockmar agreed to pay was not an admission of guilt, said
her defense attorney Jim Fahrenholtz. 

Stockmar was confident to go to trial because a jury would have found her
not guilty, he said. 

"I think that this whole ordeal has worn on my client and she's glad it over
with,"
 Fahrenholtz said. "She never would have pled guilty to anything." 

Fahrenholtz had evidence that former gallery owner Adele Arrowsmith gave
Stockmar permission to start credit card accounts. Police searched
Stockmar's home and never found any stolen art and Arrowsmith failed to
correctly take inventory, he said. 

Arrowsmith was "very shaken and very upset" by prosecutors' decision. 

"I deserved a great deal more," Arrowsmith said. "With $20,000 how am I
going to pay the artists who were also deceived and robbed?"

Prosecutors called Arrowsmith, of Burbank, Calif., several times to try to
fill in gaps in the evidence, but that didn't work, Hurlbert said. 

"That doesn't mean I didn't believe that there aren't victims in this case,"
Hurlbert said. "I just can't prove it, given the state of the evidence."

Five years later, stolen violin found
By Erin Smith/ CambridgeChronicle.com
Thursday, June 14, 2007 - Updated: 12:50 PM EST

Nearly five years after Frederic Bednarz's violin was stolen from a Harvard
Square music school, police have found the $24,000 instrument. But it's
unclear if police ever plan to charge the crooks involved in the
high-profile heist. 
 
    For Bednarz, a Montreal-born violinist, the return of the pricey
19th-century violin is a case of too little, too late. 
 
    "Well, you know, it's been such a long time that I've dealt with it and
bought another violin," said Bednarz. 
 
    In 2002, Bednarz's violin was stolen from his locker in the basement of
the Longy School of Music while he was at lunch. At the time, Bednarz had
just arrived in Boston for a two-year stint as a professional studies
student at school working toward his artist diploma in chamber music
performance. Staff and musicians searched the school for days, but couldn't
find the violin, which Bednarz had borrowed from his Montreal sponsor. 
 
    Then, last November, Weston Police received a tip about the violin and
Cambridge Police recovered the stolen instrument, according to Weston Police
Chief Steven Shaw. 
 
    Investigators in Weston and Cambridge began working together on the case
when the violin was first stolen five years ago and revived the partnership
when Weston Police received the tip last year. 
 
    "It never really fell off the radar screen," said Shaw. 
 
    Police at both departments are keeping the details about the violin's
recovery under wraps. Cambridge Police are refusing to discuss the case or
say how the rare instrument was found. No one had been charged with the
theft as of this week, and it's unclear whether Cambridge Police ever plan
to make an arrest in the case. 
 
    "That's all we're going to give out," said police spokesman Frank
Pasquarello, who refused to give a reason for withholding the information. 
 
    The violin was earlier rumored to be from the 1700s, one of the rare
violins still in existence today crafted by Italian Santo Serafin. More
recently, however, experts estimated the instrument was made in Venice,
Italy, around 1800. 
 
    At the time of the theft, musicians suspected that the violin was stolen
by teens who didn't know the value of the instrument. Police and instrument
dealers had said the rare violin would be hard to sell on the open market
without drawing attention. 
 
    The insurance company has since refunded the money for the instrument,
and Bednarz bought and tried playing several instruments in past years,
finally settling on another older instrument. 
 
    "It's not exactly what I had, but I like it," said Bednarz. 
 
    The insurance company sold Bednarz's stolen violin at Tarisio auction
house last month, according to Chris Reuning, owner of Reuning & Son Violins
in Boston. 
 
    The violin sold at auction for $24,150, said Reuning, one of the
founding partners of Tarisio. 
 
    Tarisio is the world's largest auction house for stringed instruments
and sells more than 2,000 violins, violas, cellos and bows each year. 
 
    As for Bednarz, he moved back to Montreal this week to play with the
Molinari Quartet and doesn't mind that his former violin has a new owner. 
 
    Said Bednarz, "That's OK. I'm sure someone's happy."

Painting 'could have fitted under clothes'


+++++++++++++++

Comment:

"FBI experience, is that approximately 80 per cent of museum theft cases of
art are inside jobs". This calls for some clarification. It should read 80%
of all cases 'that have been solved' appear to be inside jobs.

THE thief who stole a $1.4 million masterpiece from Sydney's Art Gallery of
NSW may have slipped it under a coat after unscrewing the painting from a
wall, the gallery's head admits.

The 17th century work by Dutch master Frans van Mieris, titled A Cavalier
(Self Portrait), was stolen from the busy gallery between 10am and 12.30pm
on Sunday, under the noses of security guards. 

The painting was swiftly and expertly removed from the wall on a day 6000
people passed through the building, said police Acting Superintendent Simon
Harding. 

Police have yet to rule out an inside job and authorities fear the
"extremely valuable and important" painting may already be out of the
country. 

Art Gallery of NSW director Edmund Capon said the theft was not reported to
police until Monday because staff had looked for the missing artwork in the
gallery's storage facilities. 

Security at the gallery was now being reviewed, Mr Capon said. 

But he said: "We have a record of security management and organisation that
is second to none, and an incident such as this is extraordinarily rare and
we have barely had an occasion like this in the past." 

Security footage is being reviewed but police say there were no cameras in
the small room where the painting was hung. 

Patrons do not pass through security screens when entering the building, and
no alarm was activated. 

While security guards were patrolling the gallery on Sunday, none were
stationed in the room where the theft occurred, police said. 

A Cavalier has been on exhibition at the gallery since it was donated by art
patron and philanthropist James Fairfax in 1993. 

Painted between 1657 and 1659, the work is one of the smallest paintings in
the gallery, measuring 30.7 cm by 26.7 cm, including the frame. 

Mr Capon said it was small enough to have been hidden under a person's
clothing. 

"To be honest, I could slip it under your coat ... it could have happened
that way," he told a reporter. 

Mr Capon appealed to members of the public at the gallery on Sunday to pass
on any relevant information. 

Police have interviewed gallery staff.

Robert E Goldman, special investigator with the FBI's art crime team, said
it was likely the heist was an inside job. 

"Our experience, the FBI experience, is that approximately 80 per cent of
museum theft cases of art are inside jobs - either people who work there -
people who we say 'have the keys to the kingdom'," Mr Goldman said on ABC
radio. 

Mr Goldman said the artwork would be extremely difficult to sell because
news of its theft would spread around the world very quickly. 

He said it was unlikely a ransom demand would be made by the art thieves. 

Mr Capon said the timber-framed artwork would likely be sold overseas if the
thieves were to offload it. 

"It's a fairly sort of discreet and esoteric audience I would say. One of
the things that occurs to me is this picture is pretty unsaleable," he said.

"Anybody who knows anything about van Mieris or Dutch painters, 17th century
painting, will know that painting and know it belongs in this building." 

The painting is on an oak panel and could crack if it is not kept in a
climate-controlled environment, he warned. 

Mr Capon said he felt a personal sense of loss following the theft. 

"If you walk home and find a gap on your wall, that's how I feel, and I
don't like gaps on the wall," he said. 

Customs and Interpol have been notified.

Freedom in frame after theft
Matthew Westwood, Deputy arts editor 
June 15, 2007 

IT'S a tiny thing, measuring just 30cm by 26cm with frame, that could easily
be tucked inside a jacket or bag.
You could call it a Cavalier take-away. 

Now the painting by Frans van Mieris I, called A Cavalier (self portrait),
has become one of Australia's most wanted, after it was stolen from the Art
Gallery of NSW on Sunday. 

Whether the person who "expertly" unscrewed it from the gallery wall was a
professional art thief or a brazen amateur, we do not know. 

The heist breaches the unspoken contract between gallery and public: that
valuable and important works of art are there for all to enjoy. 

Visitors to the handsome sandstone edifice of the AGNSW, in Sydney's Domain,
enjoy its collection for free - there is no admission charge, unlike many
galleries overseas - and are generally unmolested by security staff. 

We should cherish that. 

But it's also easy to see how such a small and valuable painting became an
object of greed. 

There is no closed-circuit television in the small antechamber, part of the
James Fairfax Galleries, where the painting usually hangs. 

On Wednesday evening, when news of the theft became public, security patrols
in the area were still intermittent. 

The little gallery was roped off - a sign said "Area Closed: No Entry" - and
yet I was able to step over the rope and inspect the holes in the walls from
where the Cavalier had been removed. 

The Dutch Cavalier, insured for $1.4 million, does not have the national
resonance for Australians that, for example, Munch's The Scream has for
Norwegians. In 2004, The Scream was stolen from the Munch Museum in Oslo. 

The AGNSW's director, Edmund Capon, yesterday indicated that security could
be improved at the gallery. 

That may be necessary. But heightened security should not spoil our freedom
to enjoy the art collection that belongs to us all.

In den Archiven lauern viele Gefahren 
 
Dr. Anna Haberditzl referierte ?ber Konservierung und Restaurierung von
Kulturg?tern 


Bronnbach. Papier zerf?llt, der Holzwurm nagt, Tinte verblasst, digitale
Aufzeichnungen sind schon nach wenigen Jahrzehnten nicht mehr les- und damit
nutzbar. Droht "Alzheimer im Archiv?" Gibt es "Gefahren f?r das Ged?chtnis
der Region"? Plakative Fragen, die Dr. Anna Haberditzl vom Ludwigsburger
Institut f?r Erhaltung von Archiv- und Bibliotheksgut am Mittwochabend zur
Er?ffnung der Ausstellung "Heute gerettet - gesichert f?r die Zukunft.
Konservierung und Restaurierung von Kulturgut im Landesarchiv
Baden-W?rttemberg" stellte.

Trotz des eher sperrigen Titels sollte sich niemand vom Besuch der
Pr?sentation im Vortragssaal des Staatsarchivs Wertheim in Kloster Bronnbach
abhalten lassen. Hinter einem vermeintlich trockenen Thema verbergen sich
interessante Geschichten. Spannend, sehr anschaulich, vor allem aber auch
nicht nur f?r ein Fachpublikum verst?ndlich, waren die Ausf?hrungen von Dr.
Haberditzl. Unumwunden r?umte sie ein, der Titel ihres Vortrages solle
"Unruhe stiften" und dar?ber "Interesse und Verst?ndnis wecken" f?r die
Arbeit der Restauratoren.

Man stelle sich die Archive, auch als "kollektive Ged?chtnisse" bezeichnet,
immer als besonders sichere Orte vor. Aber auch Papier und Pergament sei
schadensanf?llig, k?nnten gegebenenfalls nicht mehr verwendet, insbesondere
wenn die Unterlagen nicht sachgerecht aufbewahrt w?rden. Feuer und Wasser
bezeichnete die Referentin daneben als die gr??ten Feinde wertvoller alter
Exponate. Sie verwies auf den Brand in der Herzogin-Anna-Amalia-Bibliothek
in Weimar im September 2004, wobei zigtausende Kostbarkeiten verloren gingen
oder schwer besch?digt wurden. Die Kosten f?r die Wiederbeschaffung oder die
Restaurierung, soweit dies jeweils ?berhaupt m?glich sei, bezifferte sie auf
67 Millionen Euro.

Feuchtigkeit und W?rme f?rderten den Schimmelpilz, der zerst?re die Substanz
der Archivalie, Bl?tter w?rden m?rbe und br?chig. Holzwurm und M?use liebten
Staub und stickige Atmosph?re, so Haberditzl weiter in einem wahren
"Horrorszenario". Deshalb seien Sauberkeit und frische Luft bei der
Aufbewahrung so wichtig. Als "besonders heimt?ckisch" bezeichnete sie den
Tintenfra?, zerst?re dieser doch Schrift und Papier m?glicherweise nahezu
unbemerkt von innen.

Die Referentin warnte aber auch eindringlich davor, Reparaturversuche
mittels Selbstklebefolien und -b?ndern zu unternehmen und bedauerte, dass
"in der Plastikeuphorie" vergangener Jahrzehnte viele Unterlagen fest in
Folie eingeschwei?t worden seien. F?r einen dauerhaften Erhalt sei dies kaum
geeignet.

"Der gr??te Sch?dling f?r die Archivalien sind die Archivare selbst", kam
die Vortragende schmunzelnd auf ein gro?es Dilemma zu sprechen. Einerseits
sollten alte Unterlagen durchaus genutzt werden, andererseits schade dies
gerade den Materialien bei unsachgem??er Handhabung. "Jeder Nutzer hat die
Verantwortung, dass auch nachfolgende Generationen noch auf das Wissen der
Vergangenheit zugreifen k?nnen."

Mit Erstaunen mag mancher im Publikum zur Kenntnis genommen haben, dass
gerade Unterlagen j?ngeren Datums von einem fr?heren Verfall bedroht sind.
Haberditzl nannte das Stichwort "endogener Papierzerfall". Die Herstellung
von Papier zwischen etwa 1850 bis 1970 trage, auch durch die verwendeten
Materialien, "den Keim der Zerst?rung bereits in sich. Nichts da mit einer
Haltbarkeit von etwa 150 Jahren. Es ist viel schlimmer".

Die Referentin nutzte die Gelegenheit, in einem weiteren Teil ihres
Vortrags, der mit Bildern anschaulich illustriert war, auf das
Landesrestaurierungsprogramm in Baden-W?rttemberg und auf die T?tigkeit des
Instituts einzugehen, wo etwa 30 Mitarbeiter mit Restaurierung und Sanierung
besch?ftigt sind. Sie schilderte kurz auch einige Methoden der Reparatur,
ging auf die Mikroverfilmung als ein sicherer Langzeitspeicher ein und
nannte es eine besondere Herausforderung, sich der Sicherung digitalisierter
Informationen der heutigen Zeit zu widmen. ek

Off-the-wall theft sparks global search for ?600,000 masterpieceBernard
Lagan in Sydney
 
Police believe that a A$1.4 million (?600,000) painting, deftly unscrewed
from a wall while Sydney?s most distinguished art gallery was filled with
visitors, may have already been transported overseas. 

They said that the canvas by Frans van Mieris, the 17th-century Dutch
master, stolen from the Art Gallery of New South Wales, was taken by an
expert. The painting went missing during the busiest day of the week at the
gallery, which attracted 6,000 visitors, and despite the constant presence
of security guards. 

The disappearance of the work, A Cavalier (Self Portrait), painted 1657-59,
was not reported to police until Monday because gallery staff believed
initially that it had been returned to storage. 

Edmund Capon, the gallery?s long-serving director, cut short a visit to
London after learning of the theft. He said that the work, which is roughly
the size of an A3 sheet of paper, could have been smuggled from the gallery
wrapped inside a coat. 

James Fairfax, a patriarch of the Australian newspaper publishing dynasty,
who donated the painting, has been told of its theft. The painting had been
exhibited at the gallery continuously since 1993. 

Mr Capon said that it would be difficult to find a buyer for the stolen
painting. He said: ?It?s rare painting. Van Mieris is a rare artist. One of
the things that occurs to me is that this picture is pretty much unsaleable.
Firstly, because it is a small audience and it is a very specialised
interest, and secondly, because it is well known. 

?Anyone who knows anything about Van Mieris or Dutch 17th-century painting
will know that painting and know that it belongs in this building.? 

The National Gallery in London and The Getty Museum in Los Angeles are among
the world?s leading institutions to hold work by Van Mieris in their
collections. 

Regarded as among the most influential of the Leiden ?fine painters?, his
work is noted for minutely proportioned subjects, a precise attention to
detail and the use of bright colours with a shiny finish. 

Van Mieris earned a great deal of money through his paintings. However, he
is known to have wasted his fortune funding a lavish lifestyle and through
poor management of his finances.

Italian construction crew investigated after ancient artifacts looted 

Some items now decorate a hotel complex nearby 

ROME 

Italian police have recovered an ancient Greek temple dug up in southern
Italy by a construction crew who had dumped or looted the prized artifacts
and begun to pour cement over the ruins, authorities said. 

After receiving information about the discovery during construction work on
a tourist resort on the coast of southern Calabria, police used helicopters
to locate the site near the town of Crotone, said art squad officials from
the Carabinieri paramilitary police. 

More than 50 artifacts, including columns and mosaics, had been excavated
from the site and used to decorate another hotel complex nearby, while other
pieces had been placed in a dump to be reused as construction material. 

When police located the site last week, workers were preparing to lay the
foundations of the resort hotel on the remaining ruins, said Gen. Giovanni
Nistri, the head of the art squad. 

"It would have been the final tombstone for this temple," Nistri told a news
conference in Rome. 

Police identified two suspects for possible prosecution for failing to alert
authorities about the find, damaging the site and for illegal possession of
archaeological artifacts, Nistri said. The two were not arrested. 

Italy is full of archaeological treasures, many undiscovered, and developers
are required to report any finds. Countless public and private works have
been scrapped or delayed over the years as state archaeologists descended on
building sites, and it is not uncommon for developers to fail to report a
discovery and plow through ancient treasures. 

In Rome, plans to build a third subway line have been delayed for decades,
and in 1999, the construction of a parking garage caused outrage after
workers sliced through a Roman villa during hurried preparations for the
Holy Year celebrations and mosaics and ceramics from the ruins turned up in
a garbage dump on Rome's outskirts. 

The discovery of the Greek temple is of "extraordinary historic and artistic
value" and experts believe it may be part of a larger ancient settlement,
the Carabinieri said in a statement. 

The ruins are "one big puzzle" for scholars, as the area was previously
thought to be devoid of such important public buildings, said archaeological
superintendent Giovanni Guzzo. 

The temple mixes two styles of Greek architecture, combining the austere
Doric with the more graceful decorations of Ionic. It was probably built
between the fourth and third centuries BC by the Bruzii, an Italic
population that lived under Hellenistic influence, which at the time
extended across southern Italy, Guzzo said. 

He said that over the next months archaeologists will work to enlarge the
50-by-20-metre dig. They will also try to reconstruct how the original
temple must have looked by piecing together the remains scattered and
damaged by the developers.
