     I can understand that.  We're such a small market that it's 
necessary to charge so much to recoup the expense of making the stuff. 
It's relativity.  For every action, there's an equal and opposite 
reaction, and someone is gonna starve.  That's why I feel like Linux is 
so special.  People freely offer what we now have, without really 
depriving little Cindy of what's on her dinner plate.  Money doesn't 
even enter the picture.
