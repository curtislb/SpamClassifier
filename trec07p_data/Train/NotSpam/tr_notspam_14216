U.S. PLANS ECONOMIC SQUEEZE, U.N. SANCTIONS FOR SUDAN: President Bush has decided to implement a plan to pressure
Sudan's government into cooperating with international efforts to halt the violence in its troubled Darfur region,
where his administration said almost three years ago that genocide was taking place. Administration officials said
yesterday that the Treasury Department will step up efforts to squeeze the Sudanese economy by targeting government-run
ventures involved with its booming oil business, which does many of its transactions in U.S. dollars. Bush will
sanction two senior Sudanese officials and a rebel leader, who are suspected of being involved in the violence in
Darfur. The United States will also seek new U.N. Security Council sanctions against Khartoum, as well as a provision
preventing the Sudanese government from conducting military flights in Darfur. Washington Post: Bush Looks To Intensify
Pressure On Sudan http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/28/AR2007052801439.html

MAJOR IRAQ GOALS "CONSIDERED A LONG SHOT" TO BE COMPLETED BY SEPT.: U.S. military leaders in Iraq are increasingly
convinced that most of the broad political goals President Bush laid out early this year in his announcement of a troop
buildup will not be met this summer and are seeking ways to redefine success. In September, Army Gen. David H.
Petraeus, the top American commander in Iraq, is scheduled to present Congress with an assessment of progress in Iraq.
Military officers in Baghdad and outside advisors working with Petraeus doubt that the three major goals set by U.S.
officials for the government of Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki will be achieved by then. Enactment of a new law to
share Iraq's oil revenue among Sunni, Shiite and Kurdish regions is the only goal they think might be achieved in time,
and even that is considered a long shot. The two other key benchmarks are provincial elections and a deal to allow more
Sunni Arabs into government jobs. Los Angeles Times: Iraq likely to miss goals set by U.S.
http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-usiraq29may29,0,5626129.story

NO BREAKTHROUGHS, BUT A POSITIVE MEETING BETWEEN U.S., IRAN: In the highest-level public talks between the United
States and Iran in nearly 30 years, US Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker yesterday reached out to his Iranian counterpart
for help in improving Iraqi security and asked that Iran stop supplying arms to Iraqi militia groups. The Iranians did
not respond to the arms charge, Crocker said in a conference call with reporters after the four-hour meeting in
Baghdad, but offered their own proposal to establish formal security cooperation between the United States, Iran, and
the Iraqi government. The meeting ended with Crocker saying that President Bush and his senior advisers would decide
how to respond to Iran's proposal and with the Iranians reserving the right to respond to the weapons charge at a later
date. Despite the lack of a major breakthrough, both sides described the meeting between Crocker and Iranian Ambassador
Hassan Kazemi Qomi in positive terms. Boston Globe: Talks called positive as US asks Iran for help on Iraq

IS COAL THE KEY TO ENERGY INDEPENDENCE? Even as Congressional leaders draft legislation to reduce greenhouse gases
linked to global warming, a powerful roster of Democrats and Republicans is pushing to subsidize coal as the king of
alternative fuels. Prodded by intense lobbying from the coal industry, lawmakers from coal states are proposing that
taxpayers guarantee billions of dollars in construction loans for coal-to-liquid production plants, guarantee minimum
prices for the new fuel, and guarantee big government purchases for the next 25 years. With both House and Senate
Democrats hoping to pass "energy independence" bills by mid-July, coal supporters argue that coal-based fuels are more
American than gasoline and potentially greener than ethanol. New York Times: Lawmakers Push for Big Subsidies for Coal
Process http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/29/business/29coal.html

NO WORLD BANK POST FOR FRIST: Former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist has withdrawn his name from consideration for
World Bank president, a person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press on Monday. Frist, a Tennessee
Republican, served two terms in the U.S. Senate, where he was a close ally to President Bush. World Bank President Paul
Wolfowitz earlier this month announced he will step down June 30, his leadership undermined after he broke bank rules
in his handling of a generous compensation package for his girlfriend, bank employee Shaha Riza, in 2005. Frist told
administration officials Monday that he did not want to be considered for the top job at the bank, citing his desire to
take a break from government work, said the source who asked not to be identified because he had not been authorized to
speak publicly about the decision. AP via Yahoo! News: Frist withdraws name from World Bank

BUSH HEADS TO GA TO TALK IMMIGRATION: President Bush on Tuesday will visit a South Georgia facility that trains Border
Patrol agents, pushing back against conservatives who say the Senate's compromise immigration bill, which he supports,
would do little to secure the border. Supporters of the bill say it's just what Bush needs to be doing as he seeks
approval of the bill. Opponents agree - but see it as a mere public relations exercise... The trip to the Federal Law
Enforcement Training Center in Glynco will put Bush in the home state of two GOP senators - Saxby Chambliss and Johnny
Isakson - who are under fire from constituents for their part in negotiating the bill. In particular, it was Isakson's
idea to condition the bill's reforms, including providing a route to legal residency for illegal immigrants, to meeting
goals for border security. Atlanta Journal-Constitution: Bush coming to Georgia to push immigration bill
http://www.ajc.com/news/content/metro/stories/2007/05/25/0525natimmig.html

IMMIGRATION WON'T COST ANY MEMBER'S JOB IN '08, SAYS McCONNELL: Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said the
controversial immigration bill in Congress won't cost "a single member of either party" at the polls next year and
predicted the bipartisan compromise will win Senate approval next month. Most Americans want Congress to fix a system
they regard as broken even though they have reservations about the proposed legislation, McConnell said in an interview
on Bloomberg Television's "Political Capital with Al Hunt." Public opinion, he predicted, will trump such specific
concerns as whether it amounts to amnesty to grant eventual legal status to the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants
in the U.S. "This is a divisive issue" for both parties, said McConnell, a Kentucky Republican. But, he said, "I don't
think there's a single member of either party next year who is going to fail to be re-elected over this issue."

"I HAVE LEARNED SOME NEW WORDS FROM SOME OF MY CONSTITUENTS," SAYS KYL: Angry calls poured into Senator Jon Kyl's
office this week by the thousands, expressing outrage beyond anything he said he had witnessed in his 20-year political
career. The callers were inflamed by Mr. Kyl's role in shaping the bipartisan immigration compromise announced May 17,
which lawmakers continue to debate. "Yes, I have learned some new words from some of my constituents," Mr. Kyl, an
Arizona Republican, said at a news conference on Thursday, drawing titters from those in the room. Mr. Kyl, 65, who
garners top ratings from conservative groups every year, is the unlikely linchpin to the fragile alliance of Democrats
and Republicans trying to push the sprawling immigration bill through the Senate. New York Times: Change on Immigration
Turns Senator Kyl Into Lightning Rod http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/29/washington/29kyl.html

DOES AMERICA CARE ABOUT '08 YET? We have failed you. Or you have failed us. One of the two. For months and months -- it
only seems like years and years -- we have been bringing you information about the people running for president of the
United States. We have written story after story, done interview after interview. We have brought you debates with
stages as crowded as basketball courts. And the candidates have appeared on real news shows, fake news shows and late
night comedy shows...  So how are they doing? Are they getting recognized more today than they were before they started
their intensive campaigning and we started giving them constant attention? Nah. According to a Gallup Poll conducted
this month: "Despite the remarkably early start on this year's presidential campaign and the high-visibility presence
of the major candidates on television news shows and in televised debates, the name identification of the leading
candidates or potential candidates has not changed much so far this year." The Politico: To know them is to dislike
them http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0507/4223.html

SECRET SERVICE STRETCHED THIN: The U.S. Secret Service expects to borrow more than 2,000 immigration officers and
federal airport screeners next year to help guard an ever-expanding field of presidential candidates, while shifting
250 of its own agents from investigations to security details. Burdened by the White House's wartime security needs,
the persistent threat of terrorism and a field of at least 20 presidential contenders, the Secret Service was showing
signs of strain even before the Department of Homeland Security ordered protection for Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) as of
May 3, the earliest a candidate has ever been assigned protection in an election season. Washington Post: Campaign Puts
New Strain on Secret Service http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/28/AR2007052801159.html

STUDENTS FOR OBAMA NEARLY DOUBLES IN SIZE IN A MATTER OF WEEKS: The presidential campaign of Sen. Barack Obama is
successfully tapping into the youth vote energized by opposition to the Iraq war, as his burgeoning Students for Obama
movement has almost doubled its presence on the nation's college campuses in the past few weeks. Students for Obama was
one of the groups that participated in drafting the senator from Illinois into the Democratic presidential race. The
group is now an in-house arm of the "Obama for America" campaign. Since the start of last month, the group has grown
from 160 chapters across the country to about 300 and doesn't plan to lose steam after the school year. "Over the
summer, we are committed to making sure that the students remain engaged, and we will organize going door to door to
get the word out about the senator," said Meredith Segal, 21, executive director of Students for Obama. Washington
Times: Obama supporters multiply on campuses http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20070528-110118-4553r.htm

BUT THE CANDIDATE CAN'T PUT HIS SOCKS AWAY, SAYS MICHELLE: Michelle Obama has a few gripes about her husband,
Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, and she's not shy about sharing them with thousands of people she
doesn't know. He doesn't put his worn socks in with the dirty clothes. He's worse than a 5-year-old at making the bed.
And after he eats, he doesn't put away the butter. "Today, he still didn't put the butter up after he made his
breakfast. I was like, 'You're just asking for it, you know I'm giving a speech. Why don't you just put the butter
up?'" she told a roaring crowd at a recent Chicago fundraiser for women backing her husband's campaign. AP via Yahoo!
News: Michelle Obama likes to razz her husband http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070529/ap_on_el_pr/michelle_obama_s_jabs

OBAMA TO CALL FOR UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE: Seeking to add heft to his presidential bid, Democrat Barack Obama is offering
a sweeping plan that would require every American to have health coverage and calls on government, businesses and
consumers to share the costs of the program. Obama said putting in place universal health coverage has been debated for
decades, but the time has finally come to act. He said his plan could save the average consumer $2,500 a year and bring
health care to all. "The time has come for universal, affordable health care in America," Obama said in remarks
prepared for delivery at the unveiling of his plan Tuesday in Iowa City. AP via Yahoo! News: Obama calls for universal
health care http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070529/ap_on_el_pr/obama_health

THE NEW RUDY... A BIT NICER: The dyspeptic, "not afraid to suggest his opponents have really deep-seated psychological
problems" Republican mayor of fact and legend has taken a holiday. What's left on the presidential campaign trail is a
commanding daddy of a candidate, a disciplined fellow who talks about terrorism and fiscal order and about terrorism
some more. Mr. Giuliani laughs, he gestures expansively, he even pokes fun at his tendency to wax a wee bit
authoritarian. (He suggests a touch of the cane was necessary to impose discipline on that liberal asylum known as New
York.) He shakes hands with reporters he once viewed as "jerky" and assures them he is fine with tough questions about
abortion, where he has settled on a position supporting a woman's right to choose, and about gun control, where is he
at least halfway into a policy back-flip. New York Times: To Temper Image, Giuliani Trades Growl for Smile
