Million-dollar prize aims to lure new cancer ideas

Medical researchers teamed up with hedge fund managers on Wednesday
to offer a new million-dollar prize for the best new idea for cancer
research in the hopes of kick-starting innovative approaches.

They invited cancer experts, scientists and the general public to
join an Internet-based club and compete for the Gotham Prize for
Cancer Research.

Federal funding of cancer research has been flat, and is in fact
lower than in recent years when inflation is taken into account, said
Gary Curhan of Harvard Medical School.

And the system of seeking grants--money to do research--is based
around pleasing either National Institutes of Health supervisors or
gatekeepers at the advocacy organizations that pay for research on
specific types of cancer, he said.

Curhan teamed up with hedge fund managers Joel Greenblatt and Robert
Goldstein of private investment firm Gotham Capital to set up the
prize club.

"The goal here is to open up the site to people with ideas," Curhan
told reporters in a telephone briefing.

"The winners of these prizes are not going to be those who are
successful in evaluating the idea. It is going to be the person with
the best idea."

Members post an essay or thesis outlining their ideas. Cancer
researchers will be invited to peruse the ideas. At the end of the
year cancer experts such as Bert Vogelstein of Johns Hopkins
University, one of the best-known researchers in colon cancer and
cancer genes, will judge the entries.

"I have seen firsthand how many ideas with incredible potential never
reach fruition," Curhan said. "We will only make significant progress
in cancer research by learning from each other's successes and
mistakes, and by building on each other's knowledge."

People who want to make individual contributions to a particular
researcher, as opposed to making a general donation to a charity, are
also invited to look at the site.

Curhan stressed he does not believe the NIH is unimaginative in
funding research.

"Most of the work is incremental just because of the long tradition
and because people tend not to pick risks. And you tend to write
grants to what you think will get funded as opposed to your most
innovative idea," he said.

"If you want to study something that may be relatively rare, it is
not going to be given the same priority as something that is more
common such as breast cancer or prostate cancer."

The prize was launched at the Ira Sohn Investment Research
Conference, a charity cancer event named after a trader who died of
cancer at the age of 29. A second, $250,000 prize will be offered for
pediatric oncology.
