big Q1 loss and [0]how the company plans to get back into the black. AMD
admitted that Q1 was a meltdown and not just a miss. Looks like cost
cutting, including layoffs, may be on the way. But the company says it
won't change its overal direction. The CEO Hector Ruiz is quoted as
saying, 'We are not going to change our strategy because of one lousy
quarter.'"

[0]crazyeyes writes "This is easily the [1]best article I've seen
comparing data compression software. The author tests 11 compressors:
7-zip, ARJ32, bzip2, gzip, SBC Archiver, Squeez, StuffIt, WinAce, WinRAR,
WinRK, and WinZip. All are tested using 8 filesets: audio (WAV and MP3),
documents, e-books, movies (DivX and MPEG), and pictures (PSD and JPEG).
He tests them at different settings and includes the aggregated results.
Spoilers: WinRK gives the best compression but operates slowest; AJR32 is
fastest but compresses least."

SixFactor sends in word of a [0]theft of training software for a nuclear
plant. An ex-employee of the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, in
Arizona, allegedly downloaded training software to his laptop while he
was in Iran. The software was downloaded from a Maryland-based contractor
to the nuclear plant. It contained information about the Palo Verde
facility: control rooms, reactors, and design. It was used to simulate
situations for training at the site. Why the ex-engineer downloaded the
software is not known. What is troubling is this person's ability to
access the software after his employment at the site ended.

[0]Alioth writes "Twenty five years ago today, Sinclair Research launched
[1]Britain's most popular home computer of the 1980s — the Sinclair ZX
Spectrum. Costing about one third of the price of its rivals such as the
Commodore 64 while having a faster CPU and a better BASIC interpreter,
the machine sold well in many guises throughout the 1980s and had more
than a staggering 9,000 software titles. The machine may well have done
well in the US too, had Timex — the company building the machine under
license in the US — not already been in financial trouble and about to
fold. The machine was also extremely successful in Russia, although not
for Sinclair Research — because the Russians made dozens of different
clones of the machine, and did so right into the mid 1990s. The machine
still has a [0]healthy retro scene, including the development of new
commercial software by [2]Cronosoft, and new hardware such as the
[3]DivIDE, which allows a standard PC hard disc or compact flash card to
be connected to the machine."

and again until a great cataclysmic period where it is greatly reduced.
The theory essentially suggests that this 62 million year cycle can be
attributed to how our solar system moves within the milky way galaxy
which turns out to be a 64 million year cycle. It's a plausible
explanation though very tough to prove, hopefully we don't have to wait
around 64 million years to draw a conclusion on this hypothesis."

Ken Erfourth writes "The Inquirer.net is running a story about what they
consider two powerful indications that [0]Vista is failing in the
marketplace. One, Dell has [1]reintroduced PCs running Windows XP on its
website due to customer demand. Two, Microsoft is conducting a
[2]worldwide firesale on a bundle of Microsoft Office 2007/WindowsXP
Starter Edition. According to Inquirer.net, at least, these are signs of
serious problems selling Vista. Are we seeing the stumbling of the
Microsoft Juggernaught with the slow adoption of Windows Vista?"

[0]jenwren1010 writes to mention that IBM has just announced the new open
beta version of their [1]virtual Linux environment that allows users to
run x86 Linux programs on POWER processor-based IBM System p servers.
"Designed to reduce power, cooling and space by consolidating x86 Linux
workloads on System p servers, it will eventually be released as the
[rolls-off-the-tongue] 'IBM System p Application Virtual Environment
(System p AVE).' With a 31.5% global revenue share during 2006, IBM hopes
to build on System p UNIX success and extend firmly into the Linux
marketplace. Considering there are almost 2,800 applications that already
run natively on Linux on System p servers, the chances are good that it
will succeed."

[0]TheCybernator writes to mention that several activist groups have
[1]cried out in protest of the Google buyout of Doubleclick reported in
[2]recent news. "'Google's proposed acquisition of DoubleClick will give
one company access to more information about the Internet activities of
consumers than any other company in the world,' said the complaint lodged
with the Federal Trade Commission. 'Moreover, Google will operate with
virtually no legal obligation to ensure the privacy, security, and
accuracy of the personal data that it collects.' The complaint was filed
by the Electronic Privacy Information Center along with the Center for
Digital Democracy and the US Public Interest Research Group, all of which
are involved in online privacy issues."

[0]jemevans sends us a link to his nonfiction tale of [1]two California
cypherpunks who went to Baghdad to seek their fortune and bring the
Internet to Iraq. A much abridged version ran in Wired a while back. From
the original: "Ryan Lackey wears body armor to business meetings. He
flies armed helicopters to client sites. He has a cash flow problem: he
is paid in hundred-dollar bills, sometimes shrink-wrapped bricks of them,
and flowing this money into a bank is difficult. He even calls some of
his company's transactions 'drug deals' — but what Lackey sells is
Internet access. From his trailer on Logistics Staging Area Anaconda, a
colossal US Army base fifty miles north of Baghdad, Lackey runs Blue
Iraq, surely the most surreal ISP on the planet. He is 26 years old."
