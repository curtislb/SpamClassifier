TONIGHT ON SHOWBIZ TONIGHT - CNN HEADLINE PRIME 11pm ET/PT

ALEC BALDWIN'S EXPLOSIVE PHONE TIRADE
The fallout over Baldwin's insult and threat-filled voicemail
that he left for his 11-year-old daughter, Ireland. Why so many
people are taking Baldwin's side and are saying they understand
why he lost his temper. But does that excuse his behavior? And
did his ex, Kim Basinger, purposely leak the voicemail tape?
Showbiz Tonight investigates the raging debate.

HOLLYWOOD'S MOST OUTRAGEOUS CELEBRITY COURT CASES!
Anna Nicole's battle for her late husband's fortune…
Winona Ryder's shoplifting trial…
>From Martha Stewart's jailhouse poncho, to Michael Jackson in
pajamas, Showbiz Tonight with a three-ring circus! The
craziest, most over-the-top star court cases ever!

HOLLYWOOD AND VIOLENCE: THE VIRGINA TECH MASSACRE
Showbiz Tonight's Brooke Anderson with a controversial,
revealing look at whether there really is a connection between
movies which have lots of violence, like "The Matrix" and
"Natural Born Killers," and horrific, mass real-life killings.
Plus, the cast of the hot new movie, "Spider-Man 3," is
speaking out - Showbiz Tonight goes one-on-one with them to get
their emotional, provocative thoughts on Hollywood and
Violence.
