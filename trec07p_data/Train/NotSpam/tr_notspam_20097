     I second the motion.  I'm about to get a LiteTalk here this week 
and and install Slackware.  An extra 7 to 10 Gig dual-boot partition is 
a darned good one.  I was planning on running a dual-boot setup to the 
same kernal, hopefully using the append command in lilo to boot 
different runlevels.  Have a coupleset aside for emergency boots to 
software synth emulation in one runlevel, etc...if lilo supports it. 
Having an emergency diagnostic partition is even better.  Thanks Spie.

         Michael
