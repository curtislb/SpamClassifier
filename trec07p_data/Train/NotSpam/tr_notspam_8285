Subject: looping through a file
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed

I have one file that contains a log. I do a substr to get the 
information out of that and push it into an array.

I have a second file that contain another log. I need to loop through 
the items in the array and find them in this log. Once I find the line 
that the id is on, I need the next line /^AMP-commit/ captured.

I am getting:

"Use of uninitialized value in pattern match (m//) at ./amp_parse.pl 
line 39, <$AFILE> line 213622."

This is what I have so far:

use strict;
use warnings;

my $IDFILE = 'H_E';
my $AMPFILE = 'a.log';
my $OUTFILE = 'report.lst';

my @id_hits;


# loop through the id file to get the prime id from each line and
# push it onto the @hits array
#
open my $IFILE, '<', $IDFILE || die "Could not open $IDFILE: $!";

while ( my $ifile_line = <$IFILE> ) {
     my $hits = substr($ifile_line, 0, 6);
     push @id_hits, $hits;
}
close $IFILE;

# test: it prints out all the ids I thought it should
#print "@id_hits";

# loop through the a.log find the line matches for the hits in
# this @id_hits array. Get the next line for reporting.
#
open my $AFILE, '<', $AMPFILE || die "Could not open $AMPFILE: $!";

my ( $line, $next_line );

my @log = <$AFILE>;
while ( @log ) {

     # use the @id_hits to search the log file for the line that
     # contains the id and get the next line as the message to print
     # to the OUTFILE.
     foreach my $prime_id ( @id_hits ) {
         $line = shift @log until $line =~ /$prime_id/;
         undef $line;
         $next_line = shift @log until $next_line =~ /^AMP-commit/;
         my $amp_msg = $next_line;
         undef $next_line;
         open my $OFILE, '>', $OUTFILE || die "Cannot create: $!";
         print $OFILE "$prime_id:\t$amp_msg\n" || die "Cannot print: $!";
         close $OFILE;
     }
}

close $AFILE;

Thanks for any help you can give...

Robert
