Commander Rick Sturckow and his six crewmates began strapping in aboard the=
 shuttle Atlantis around 4:20 p.m. Launch is targeted for 7:38:04 p.m., rou=
ghly the moment Earth's rotation carries pad 39A into the plane of the inte=
rnational space station's orbit. There are no technical problems of any sig=
nificance and forecasters say an afternoon sea breeze is setting up as expe=
cted to blow cloudy weather inland. This status report will be updated afte=
r Atlantis takes off or as conditions warrant.
