In the next few days I will be creating a number of new RT [TODO] 
tickets -- 56, to be precise, one for each of Parrot's current 
configuration steps.   These RT tickets will track progress in writing 
unit tests for the Perl 5 packages under the config/ directory which 
govern the individual steps.  The one RT approach per configuration step 
has been discussed with particle and ptc.

The packages in question get a certain amount of test coverage already 
via the tests already found in t/configure/*.t.  So the focus of these 
unit tests will be (a) ensuring that the Perl 5 code is good qua Perl 5; 
(b) covering as yet untested branches and conditions; (c) improving the 
often skimpy documentation of these packages; and (d) resolving other RT 
tickets referenced in inline comments in these packages as well as other 
issues raised in such inline comments.

I've begun writing these tests in the 'reconfigure' branch, and every 
config/*/*.pm package already has a corresonding test file in that 
branch's t/configure/ directory.  So there will be no immediate impact 
on trunk.  I hope that this will provide an opportunity for people at 
the post-YAPC hackathon in Houston who are newcomers to the Parrot 
project to be able to make an immediate contribution.

Comments?  Objections?  Plaudits?  Let's hear them now.

Thank you very much.
