US envoy urges Thailand to talk with drug firms

US Ambassador to Thailand on Monday said that compulsory licencing may
not be necessary if the Thai government and major drug companies could
talk their way into a solution that will work out for all parties concerned.

Speaking to journalists after a one-hour talk with Mongkol Na Songkhla
,Thai Public Health Minister, Ambassador Ralph Boyce Jr. urged the Thai
government to enter into negotiations with major pharmaceutical
companies to find a balance between a price war with drug companies and
the sustainable expansion of public access to quality, affordable medicine.

In November, Dr. Mongkol, as Thailand's Minister of Public Health,
issued a compulsory licence for Merck's HIV/Aids treatment drug
Efavirenz followed by the second-line combination anti-retroviral
therapy Kaletra and the heart disease drug Plavix in January. He
explained that his action was in accord with the WTO decision which
allows developing countries to produce or import generic versions of
patented drugs for government use.

"We respect the Thai government decision to issue compulsory licencing
under the WTO (World Trade Organization), but what we would like to see
is the negotiations between the Thai government and representatives of
major drug companies," Mr. Boyce said.

Thai public health officials maintained that international trade rules
allow national governments to enforce compulsory licencing of
patent-protected drugs in cases of national public health emergencies or
crises.

More than 500,000 people in Thailand are living with HIV, according to
UNAIDS, the UN agency that co-ordinates the global fight against the
deadly virus.

And some 200,000 patients in Thailand who suffer from heart conditions
have blood clotting problems that could be treated with Plavix, but only
20 per cent of them have access to the medicine, according to the Thai
public health ministry.

"The result of the talks may lead to those companies' decision to lower
their price of the drugs that will be affordable to all and that
compulsory licencing may not be needed," said the US envoy.

Dr. Mongkol said he will travel to the US next month to talk with US
trade officials and other agencies concerned on the issue. (TNA)
