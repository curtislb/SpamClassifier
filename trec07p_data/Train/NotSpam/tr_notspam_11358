I don't know of a way to directly pass a variable from one script to
another. However, you could easily enough pass it in as a command line
argument. Call the second script like

perl /path/to/script2.pl variable

And in script two, do something like

my $argument = shift | die "no argument given";

I'm sure TIMTOWTDI though.
