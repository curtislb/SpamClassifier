Ericsson and Napster Supply Mobile Music Service to Swisscom




LOS ANGELES, June 5, 2007 /PRNewswire-FirstCall via COMTEX News Network/
-- Ericsson (Nasdaq: ERIC) and Napster (Nasdaq: NAPS) today announced an
agreement with Swisscom Mobile, the largest Swiss mobile operator, to
become the company's exclusive mobile music service provider with
Napster Mobile. The service will give Swisscom Mobile subscribers access
to the easy-to-use Napster-branded mobile music service and its
unparalleled music selection. 

The Napster Mobile service, co-developed by Napster and Ericsson,
contains more than 3 million tracks -- more than any other mobile music
service on the market today. It leverages Napster's vast catalogue of
full-length songs and artist images, and Ericsson's mobile platform and
personalization content. Ericsson develops, integrates, hosts and
manages round-the-clock operations for the service, while Napster
contributes expert content programming, including "featured artists" and
"top tracks of the day." Swisscom will launch the service with a major
ad campaign starting this week. 

Daniel Staub, Head of Product Marketing of Swisscom Mobile says: "We are
amazed by the endless variety of music offered by the Napster Mobile
service. Its 3-million-track-strong music offering contains everything
from international smash hits to hard-to-find local tracks. Our
customers now have easy access to them, all through their mobile phones.
With Napster Mobile we expand our existing Multimedia-offer on music." 

Napster Mobile enables Swisscom Mobile subscribers to search, browse,
preview, purchase and subscribe to music content from virtually all
record labels via their WAP or Java-enabled handsets. The service also
includes such features as dual delivery, which ensures that once content
is purchased on the mobile phone, a copy is sent to the customer's PC as
well. Napster Mobile also comes with a recommendation engine that
introduces consumers to new music that matches their taste, thus making
it easy to navigate through the huge content selection. 

Stefan Koetz, Country Manager at Ericsson Switzerland says, "We are very
pleased that Swisscom has selected Napster Mobile as their mobile music
service and look forward to providing the more than 4.6 million Swisscom
Mobile subscribers with a music experience that really delivers." 

Brad Duea, Napster president, says: "We're proud to be partnering with
Swisscom Mobile, continuing our track record of launching Napster Mobile
with the largest mobile operators in markets across the globe. We
believe that Swisscom Mobile subscribers will be very excited to be able
to enjoy the Napster music experience of anytime, anywhere access to a
vast catalog of content and powerful discovery tools; all at their
fingertips with Napster Mobile." 

Napster Mobile is a hosted service part of Ericsson's industry leading
Managed Services offering, which contains attractive new services that
operators can launch quickly, easily and cost-efficiently.

communications through its continuous technology leadership. Providing
