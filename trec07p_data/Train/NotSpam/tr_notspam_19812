flash and pdf both now are owned by adobe.  If I'm not much mistaken 
Section 508 compliance requires that java may not be used in any 
user-visible fashion on web sites but may be used for house-cleaning 
chores behind the scenes.  As I understand it, java is just too immature 
to be on the Internet at all.  From a security perspective it offers way 
too many opportunities to the kind of people that otherwise trash 
perfectly reasonable neighborhoods and java can't adequately defend 
itself.
