Norway asks Novartis to withdraw case

TIMES NEWS NETWORK[ TUESDAY, MAY 01, 2007 02:36:01 AM]
New Delhi: Swiss pharma-major Novartis’s fight against certain
provisions in the Indian patent laws — which do not allow patenting of
incremental innovations — has taken an interesting turn with Norway’s
minister of international development Erik Solheim asking the company to
withdraw its case against India.

Novartis had filed the case following India’s rejection of its patent
plea for ‘Glivec’ — a drug for fighting blood cancer. In its appeal,
Novartis stated that the provisions in the Indian patent laws, which do
not allow patents on incremental innovations, went against the Trips
agreement and should be amended. India’s argument is that allowing
patents on incremental innovations would lead to ever-greening of
patents wherein companies would file for fresh patents by making
superficial changes in the patented product once the life of the initial
patent is over after 20 years.

In a letter to Novartis CEO Daniel Vasella, the Norwegian minister
stated that India contributed in very significant ways to the overall
production capacity for life saving generic drugs, with major exports to
developing countries. It is important for global health that this
contribution can continue, he said.

Urging Novartis to seek a solution in the current case that adequately
address these concerns, the minister said the company should withdraw
its case against India.
According to an official release, Mr Vasena underlined that there is a
shared interest in a universal, rule-based, open, non-discriminatory and
multilateral trading system, that, at the same time, can support global
health security. “Building in public health safeguards in national
patent laws to ensure that patents do not limit access to medicines is a
right of every country. The cost of innovation cannot be borne by
countries and people with the weakest economic capacity,” he said.

The minister added that international trade policies and agreements need
to be placed within the context of protecting and promoting health and
well-being. “Global health security is depending on each country having
the capacity to safeguard public health”, the letter added.
