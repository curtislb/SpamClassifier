I had to deal with this when working on the .Net translator, though I 
really fudged it. Basically, I just didn't have them as methods, but 
rather subs. That meant they didn't expect an invocant. And I translated 
the callmethod .Net op to do the Right Thing. Or something along those 
lines. The disadvantage is that they won't dispatch as methods on the 
instance of the object in Parrot-land (which is at least C# 
behavior...you can't call static methods using obj.meth, only 
class.meth, ignoring C# 3.0's extension methods). But that isn't Perl 6 
behavior, as I understand it.

How about writing the method without the :method modifier, but also 
addmethod'ing it to the class? Then it will be found by find_method, but 
won't think the first parameter is an invocant. Something here doesn't 
feel quite right to me, though I'm tired and can't put my finger on what.
