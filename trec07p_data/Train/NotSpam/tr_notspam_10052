Oh, some someone must agree that word characters might be the better choice.
As I wrote Moritz, I could only find the replacements for __PACKAGE__ 
and alike. Additionally it would be very nice to group them in packages.

As I partially wrote Moritz, I
a) don't think that it's the case very often. you have to write the 
sigil a thousand times where it wouldn't be useful for only 1 case where 
you'd have a name conflict.
b) even if there would be a conflict, it might be considered bad style 
to use identical identifiers (besides the sigil) for different things 
(vars/objects/subs/operators/...).

I'm not much into Python. But as at least Ruby, Python, JavaScript, 
Groovy and Lua (which all are relatively young languages) don't force 
you to write semicolons.
So semicolons don't seem to be the best invention since sliced bread. 
There should be extra-syntax for the rare cases (multiline) and not for 
the common ones.

And it should be. I really like the expressive power of most of the 
operators. Especially the new zip/junction/reduce/smart-match ones.
But I don't like doing implicit type casting with operators.
It's even discouraged in Perl5 as we have a warning for that.
So maybe it'd be a good idea to completely drop it.

At least almost everyone to whom I said, that I do most work in Perl, 
responded with some sentence containing the word "ugly" or "unreadable".
To get away from that image, it's neccessary to do some radical changes 
I think.
