Well, many programs still use them by default.  For example, some have 
discussed aumix as a mixer program.  It uses /dev/mixer, which is why it 
doesn't show all controls.  Most programs, including Mplayer still default 
to OSS-compatible operation unless overridden.  So, until this changes, I 
consider the OSS emulation mandatory.  There is the aoss command, which 
tries to make a program that would normally use OSS use ALSA instead, but 
it doesn't always work.
