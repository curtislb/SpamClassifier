Thanks for your note Thomas.  I do feel that the problems you have 
rightly listed occur infrequently and that often I only care about two 
groups.  Rank tests generally are good at relatives, not absolutes.  We 
have an efficient test (Wilcoxon) for relative shift but for estimating 
an absolute one-sample quantity (e.g., median) the nonparametric 
estimator is not very efficient.  Ironically there is an exact 
nonparametric confidence interval for the median (unrelated to Wilcoxon) 
but none exists for the mean.

Cheers,
Frank
