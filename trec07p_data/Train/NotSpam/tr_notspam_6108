The point was that the clause under consideration, which is a non-free
restriction, could re-emerge after being made seemingly non-applying by
the renaming.
Of course the DFSG don't insist that I be allowed to violate the terms
of a license!  GNU GPL v2 terms, however, do not include any non-free
restriction, while the clause under consideration is non-free: this is
why I was concerned by the possible failure to nullify it!

Anyway, this discussion is probably moot now, since upstream is now
considering a different licensing scheme: sticking to LGPL as far as
copyright is concerned, and adding (non-free) trademark restrictions.=20
