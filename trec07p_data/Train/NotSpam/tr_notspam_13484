Well, we already support that.

To get the list of available activities in GCompris:
gcompris -l list

To run a single activity (here the time reading activity):
gcompris -l /discovery/miscelaneous/clockgame

You can also run in a filter mode to show only a subset of activities by
specifying a directory (here the user will have the regular menu by only
with our reading activity):
gcompris -l /reading

Is there really a way to do that in Sugar. Does the GCompris weight is
acceptable now (~60MB). On our side we are OK to reorganize our code to
make it possible to bundle each activity separately but this is a lot of
work. Today we have well defined independent activities but they share
the same resources. It's a lot of boring work to split this out and it
brings some new questions.

For example, how to bundle audio voices. We have 80MB of audio voices
but for each country it take about 4MB. So if we create a bundle for the
reading activity, how do we manage the sounds, do we have to create a
reading activity bundle for each language.
