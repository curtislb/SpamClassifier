Novartis buys exclusive rights to anti-smoking `vaccine`


Basel (Switzerland), April 26: Novartis AG said today it will pay Cytos
Biotechnology AG up to 600 million Swiss francs (USD 500 million) for
the exclusive right to develop, produce and market an experimental drug
it hopes will help cure smokers of their habit.

The pharmaceuticals giant said it would initially pay Cytos 35 million
francs (USD 29 million), with further payments dependent on the success
of the new drug, NicQb, which is being billed as an anti-smoking
"vaccine." NicQb, which is still in clinical trials, blocks the nicotine
rush people experience when smoking a cigarette.

Novartis said the drug had the potential to help an estimated 1 billion
smokers worldwide who want to quit. Shares in Cytos, a spin-off from the
Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, jumped 6 per cent on the news to
reach 1.75 francs (USD 1.45) on the Zurich exchange. Novartis shares
were down 0.2 per cent at 69.90 francs (USD 58.11).
