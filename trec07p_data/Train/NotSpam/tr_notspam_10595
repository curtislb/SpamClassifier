I don't think it is really a language issue at all. Of course the patent
remains, because the patent privilege is always subject to state control.
But the patent "monopoly" is also subject to such control, so even that
monopoly remains intact--that is, it is a monopoly always subject to state
control, something about which the international patent lobby--with whom
I'm afraid we have been too cozy lately--would prefer we remain ignorant.
