As we had promised, ftp.br.debian.org now mirrors the CDs as well as
the packages. We've got all archs and all formats for etch.

They're available through http and ftp at ftp.br.debian.org/debian-cd,
and through rsync at ftp.br.debian.org::debian-cd.

Please update the mirror lists. I was going to use the submission form
but we don't know yet who (if?) we'll get a push from, and I'm afraid
of using the modification option, only fill in the CD fields and have
the others erased :-)

All iso images were generated with jigdo. It produces the ~400GB set
with only about 2GB of downloads. Nice job...

On another issue, that dns change for mx and cl didn't happen yet. The
new release would be a good time for it.
