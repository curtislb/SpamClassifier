Hi

No, why, isn't an ARM processor good enough?  As I said with a 2 Gb stick in one of the two USB ports, it's quite responsive in loading apps but I haven't installed any speech on it.  I should that but as I said it's been found permanent tasks, so won't be messed about with.

Thanks, for the louder Linux info.  I didn't know about that one.

Regards

Gena

Hi,
I've been hoping for an affordable portable Linux system for some
time, especially if it has wireless networking and ethernet.  I hate
lugging a laptop; the dead weight of a screen is especially irksome.
PDAs with speech are overpriced.  Most seem to run Windows, with one
exception (the Pappenmeier device).

There's a group of people who are trying to turn a Linksys router into
a talking portable.  See www.louderlinux.net.  I wish them luck.

Does your "slug" device use an x86 processor?  That would make it
especially attractive.
