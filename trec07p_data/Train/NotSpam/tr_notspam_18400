  Preservation of the endangered cultural assets of the traditional Egyptian storyteller's heritage
   
   
   The traditional Egyptian storytellers? heritage is a very important art in its musical, theatrical and cinematic forms. In its expressive singing, stylized speech, motion, repertoire of narratives and mimetic gesture, it is one of the most unique expressions of Egyptian?s rich performing arts tradition and folk culture. In addition to its significance as a foremost literary and musical expression, this heritage represents a repository for the rich spectrum of Egyptian folk history, customs, beliefs, symbolism and traditions not only in its intangible form but also in its instruments and movable assets. 


    The traditional Egyptian storytellers? heritage consists of many stories and epic poems such as al-Sirah al-Hilaliyyah and its characters such as Abu zed al-Hilaliy, El-Zenaty Kalepha and Zayab Ibn Ganem.


    Al-Sirah al-Hilaliyyah, which recorded within the second proclamation of Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity is just one of the major oral epic poems to develop within the Egyptian and Arabic folk tradition from the Middle Ages to the nineteenth century, al-Sirah al-Hilaliyyah is the last of these epics to remain alive in oral tradition and continues to be performed in its integral musical form until today and has survived to the present day in Egypt.


    There were other stories such as the story of Sayf Ibn Ze El-Yazen, the story of Antra Ibn Sadad and Abla and Antra?s partner Shaybob and a lot of Political and emotional stories. 
   
    
    In its musical form there are different forms of storytelling performed by vocalists or poets with musical instruments accompaniment.


    Several traditional musical instruments traditionally used to accompany the traditional storytellers, poetries and singers. Those instruments are mostly wooden instruments. There are several sorts of instruments include string instruments such as Rababa and Smsmiyya, wind instrument such as Salamiyyah, Zummarah, Mizmar, Arghul and Nay and percussion instruments such as Tablah and Tambourine.
   
  - Rababa (Arabic Fiddle) Or Oriental Rebec Or (Spike Fiddle) The Egyptian Rababa or Arab fiddle is the earliest known bowed instrument. The instrument was first mentioned in the 10th century, became prominent in medieval and later in Arab art music. In medieval times the word Rababa was used for any bowed instrument. The Rababa has a membrane belly made mainly of wood, two or three strings. There is normally no fingerboard, the strings being stopped by the player's fingers. The Rababa?s body shapes vary; pear-and boat-shaped Rababa was particularly common, Bedouin musicians mainly play rectangular bodies, flat round and trapezoidal are also found. Throughout the Middle East and Egypt, the word Rababa or a derivative name refers to a spike fiddle, one that has a small round or cylindrical body and a narrow neck. It has an easily recognizable rich thick sound - a combination of high and low tones.
   
  - Smsmiyya (Tanpora) is a musical instrument made of wood and has five strings. Noun as Tanpora the Smsmiyya used in Nubia where from it moved to the Sues canal area where it became the common popular musical instrument especially in Port Said, Ismailiya and sues sites. 
  
  - Salamiyyah is an open-ended reed-flute, characteristically breathy in tone and commonly seen in folk-oriented Sufi performances. 


  - Zummarah (Oriental Salamia) or (Kawla) has a two identical reed tubes, each tube has five or six holes and a smaller tube inside which vibrates to produce the sound. It is played using a circular breathing technique, which produces a continuous sound.


  - Mizmar  (Or reed pipe) is a double reed appears characteristically with a large double-sided drum called Tabl baladi. Typically, three Mizmars play together. Not too long ago, a 3,000-year-old tomb of Egypt was uncovered on an archeological dig sponsored by the University of Cairo. During the excavation, an ancient reed Mizmar was discovered in the ruins. Although pictures of such musical instruments were depicted on the walls of other previously excavated tombs, this was the first incidence in history of actually uncovering the real object.
   
  - Arghul is a reed flute, open-ended and end-blown. It has a limited range and a breathy sound, which the player sometimes accompanies by humming and associated with weddings and dances, and also played by shepherds. Arghul resembles the Palestinian Yarghul.
   
  -Nay (Oriental Flute) is an open-ended, usually 60 to 70 cm long, with 5 to 7 finger holes, obliquely blown flute made from reed or wood. Exhibiting a breathy tone, it has a wide range of almost two and a half octaves. It is also extremely expressive and capable of producing dynamic and tonal inflections. The development and use of the Nay has been attributed to shepherds, but it is, in fact, an urban instrument. The Nay also appears in some Sufi musical performances.


  - Tabl (or tablah ) (Or Darbuka) is a cylindrical double-sided wooden drum, covered with goatskin played with the hand on one side and with a wooden beater on the other. The name is widely used, though the instrument itself has regional variations.
   
  - Tambourine (Tar) is a one of the musical instruments which has it's origins in the middle ages. It is also known in Egypt as Riqq (Rikk, reqq or Rek), this Egyptian tambourine is a cylindrical drum with sets of double cymbals, which can create many distinct tones and patterns.  
   
   
    In the theatrical form another sort of the storytellers? tool been used.


  Qaraquz or Araquz is the fames name for this tool, which form featuring handcrafted puppets and complex musical styles. Qaraquz is a sort of glove puppet, which made of wood and textile. The storyteller or puppeteer used to be hided behind a textile and wooden screen tells or sings his story and moves the puppets in the front of the attendance.
     
   
    In it cinematic form another sort of the storytellers? tools been used.
   
  Sanduk El-Donia (= box of the world) (Or Peep-show box) is the name for this tool (Sanduk is an Arabic word means box and El-Donia is an Arabic word means the world), which is a wooden box used by the storytellers for telling the stories accompanied by pictures and music. People used to look to the picture inside the box through some holes while the artist tells the stories and changes the picture.

Getty's New Chief Says His Job One is to Refocus on Art 
By Mike O'Sullivan 
Los Angeles
12 June 2007
  


The J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles has been engulfed in controversy
over disputed art works, but the new head of the Getty Trust, which oversees
the museum, says the institution is moving beyond the disputes and regaining
its focus. In Los Angeles, Mike O'Sullivan spoke with Getty Trust president
and chief executive James Wood.
  
With its huge endowment from the estate of the late oilman J. Paul Getty,
the Getty Trust oversees a museum, housed at two scenic Los Angeles
locations, as well as institutes devoted to art research and conservation,
and a philanthropic foundation that promotes and preserves the world's
artistic heritage.

However, a torrent of bad publicity followed the 2005 indictment in Italy of
former Getty antiquities curator Marion True. She was charged with
trafficking in stolen art works. Then another controversy swirled around the
former head of the Getty Trust, whom critics accused of enjoying a lavish
lifestyle at the Getty's expense.

The Getty Trust's newly appointed president and chief executive, James Wood,
comes to Los Angeles with 25 years of experience at the respected Art
Institute of Chicago. He says it was frustrating and painful to watch
developments unfolding at the Getty.

"The Getty had challenges, so it wasn't a matter of second guessing, but I
think it was a pained feeling that with the resources, that with the
extraordinary staff, with the broad reach, it had lost its way," said James
Wood.

Wood says, as new head of the Getty Trust, his job is to restore the
institution's focus.

The Getty has been involved in discussions with both Italy and Greece over
contested art works. Getty officials have returned four disputed items to
Greece, including a rare funerary wreath. They have also agreed with Italian
authorities to return 26 items. Italy wants 46 returned, but Wood says the
Getty has clear title to a number of them. Talks between the Getty and
Italian officials have stalled.

"Just because something is asked to be returned does not mean that it should
go back, legally, or perhaps for the best interests of the broadest number
of people who have the chance to be exposed to those works of art," he
said."So this is a complex field, as it should be."

He says the museum now has a strict acquisitions policy in place, and that
in the art world, there will always be some disputes over ownership.

Wood addressed a civic group called Town Hall Los Angeles, and before the
meeting, he spoke with VOA. He says the Getty is firmly rooted in Los
Angeles. Wood says the West Coast city has become an art center, but that
its treasures are dispersed across a sprawling metropolis. 

The Getty's antiquities collection is housed in a seaside villa, while the
hilltop Getty Center contains photographs, manuscripts, and European art.
Separate museums in the region have collections of modern, Asian and Latin
American art. Wood says a visitor to Los Angeles has a different experience
from a visitor to New York, who may go to Metropolitan Museum of Art, with
its comprehensive collections.

"In the Met, you come through the front door and you may go to the right or
the left and choose Egypt or Greece or up to European paintings," said James
Wood. "Here, you get in your car and you may go to three different
institutions, but the experience can be extraordinary. You just have to plan
your time a little differently. But I realize this is a very LA way of doing
things."

He says Los Angeles museums face the challenge of coordinating their efforts
to make their art works more accessible to the public.

He adds that the Getty plans to keep collecting the world's best art, and
intends to follow strict procedures to ensure it is acquiring it legally.

Aumenta robo de arte sacro en Tlaxcala, afirma sacerdote   

Ranulfo Rojas Bret?n, encargado de las relaciones interinstitucionales de la
di?cesis, se?al? que dicha situaci?n es preocupante sobre todo porque los
robos podr?an ser obra de una banda organizada.

Tlaxcala.- Durante el primer semestre del a?o se increment? en la entidad el
robo de arte sacro, ya que hasta el momento se han registrado 5
sustracciones de piezas, se?al? la Di?cesis de Tlaxcala.

Ranulfo Rojas Bret?n, encargado de las relaciones interinstitucionales de la
di?cesis, se?al? en entrevista que esta situaci?n es preocupante sobre todo
porque los robos podr?an ser obra de una banda organizada.

Expuso que desde el 25 de marzo pasado, cuando fue robada con violencia una
figura de San Jos?, en la parroquia de Tepeyanco, se han registrado otros
cuatro robos m?s en templos de Tlaxco, Zitlaltepec, Texcalac y San Lorenzo
Tlacualoyan.

Expres? que ?los robos se han estado incrementado lamentablemente, por lo
que estamos solicitando la actuaci?n de las dependencias de seguridad para
no frenar el trabajo (de protecci?n a las piezas de arte sacro)?.

Coment? que la forma en que se han presentado los robos hacen pensar que
podr?a tratarse de delincuencia organizada, dedicada a esta actividad
il?cita.

Es por ello que solicit? el apoyo de las polic?as municipales y de la
polic?a estatal para que se realicen rondines cerca de las parroquias.

Asegur? que la Iglesia cat?lica est? preocupada pues al parecer los
delincuentes aprovechan momentos de distracci?n del personal que cuida los
templos ?y a plena luz de d?a sustraen las piezas?.

Detall? que los robos se registraron el 25 de marzo, 3 y 25 de mayo, as?
como 5 y 8 de junio. ?Esto preocupa demasiado, pues no s?lo es un robo a la
Iglesia es un robo al patrimonio? nacional, apunt?.

Detall? que algunas piezas que han sido robadas son una imagen de San Jos?,
dos im?genes de la Virgen Mar?a y una imagen de San Mart?n de Porres, entre
otras piezas de arte.

?Yo presumo que se trata de una banda organizada, no solamente (es) la
sustracci?n, es incluso la venta, y posiblemente sacar del pa?s las piezas?,
sostuvo. Coment? que hay indicios de que los robos pueden ser por pedido.

?Por ejemplo en Texcalac, en el nicho donde estaba la imagen de la Virgen
que se llevaron, hab?a tambi?n una estatua del Sagrado coraz?n de Jes?s, y
se llevaron s?lo la de la virgen?, dijo.

Esto hace pensar que iban s?lo por la imagen que les interesaba, acot? Rojas
Bret?n.

Our Opinion


Please just get to the art of it


When the DA's MP Dianne Kohler-Barnard last week challenged Arts and Culture
Minister Pallo Jordan on the disappearance of at least 14000 of the
country's art treasures over the last four years, he launched a stinging
attack on the MP and her party.

Her rebuked her for speaking "as if she is the champion of the arts
community" and accused the DP of a "schizophrenic attitude" towards his
department.

On the issue at hand - the wholesale ransacking of South Africa's cultural
heritage from museums, galleries and collections nationwide - the Minister
was deafeningly silent. How sad, considering the scale of a very real
problem.

Last year a list of missing key artworks worth millions was drawn up. It
included:

*An oil painting by Gerard Sekoto, titled The Gardener. It was stolen from
an unnamed university in Eastern Cape in 1999;

*Another Sekoto masterpiece, Hotela Bantu was stolen the same year from the
same university collection; 

*Pierneef's Near Golden Gate, ripped from a wall at the SABC in Johannesburg
in 2005. The 1955 commission is believed to be the artist's biggest work and
has an estimated value of R5-million; 


*An animal totem by Henriette Ngako and a Moses Seleko sculpture, The
Gumboot Dance, both stolen in Pretoria 2005.

Then there are the bronze sculptures - some of them huge - that have walked
out of collections and "evaporated" or, in some cases, turned up in
scrapyards.

Some thefts - like El Greco's oil, The Apostle Thomas from the Johannesburg
Art Gallery- have only been noticed months after their disappearance.

According to Gerhard de Kamper of the South African Museums Association,
paintings, ceramics, period posters etcetera, dating back to the 18th
century are stolen daily, but are often not reported to police. This is
because galleries do not want word to get out that valuable pieces are being
stolen from under their noses.

A Stolen Heritage Objects Awareness campaign was launched last year in a bid
to recover art works, but we have yet to be informed of any significant
results.

Speaking during last week's debate on the Arts and Culture budget vote,
Kohler-Barnard said the management of the department - which is ultimately
responsible for safeguarding South Africa's cultural treasures - was
shambolic.

The last Auditor-General's report found "a whole new batch of problems
generated in the absence of any tangible leadership: Assets misplaced, not
recorded, incorrectly recorded or just plain missing," she said.

She raises a valid point and the Minister would do well to face it head on
instead of stooping to nasty personal attacks. Failing that Andy Warhol's
definition of art as being "what you can get away with" will take on a whole
new meaning in Africa.
