Ah, nope, I don't think that fully covers the situation. While a derivative 
work is a work that would attract its own copyright, it is not the only works 
that might incorporate or contain a BY-SA work and not be a derivative.

Have you missed the talk on collections? (Collective works or whatever the 
correct terminology is.)

A collective work canget a copyright on the collection. Right? Wrong?

Is a newspaper on the whole copyrighted? Or only the individual articles? Is a 
magazine copyrighted?

The problem is that we only seek to control derivatives and we could also 
control copying and distribution where needed.

Or am I totally off base.

I agree with that, but if we can do it using copyright law itself, might not 
that be better? Looking at this last paragraph, I think you might not fully 
get what  Iam trying to say.
