I´m sorry, such a hint is obsolete. When I get home today, I´ll check
where it is in the documentation and fix it. NAS seemed to be quite
interesting thing but it is dead now. You can use Flite with ALSA
through Speech Dispatcher, please switch oss to alsa
in /etc/speech-dispatcher/modules/flite.conf .

Have a nice day,
Hynek
