Yes, Wine is a graphical program (a Windows emulator).  You might be
able to run a Window$ $creenreader under it; I honestly don't know.
A quick google search for "Echolink" "Linux" yielded the
following URL: http://cqinet.sourceforge.net.  This is a suite of
programs that are compatible with EchoLink, and it may be what you're
looking for.
