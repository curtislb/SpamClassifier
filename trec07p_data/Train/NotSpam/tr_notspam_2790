Actually, that's not what's going on. The FSF clearly state that you may
make edits to the GPL, but that you must then
* remove the preamble
* rename the license to something else (it must not be "GNU General
  Public License" anymore, then)

While I have no issue with either and agree with your conclusion anyway,
it's not the same thing as "using copyright on the license to prevent
incompatible changes"
