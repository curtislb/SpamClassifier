In that case you may want to either not use that field for the key to
the hash or use nvl (or its equivalent in your RDBMS) to replace the
null with a unique value (something like nvl(column, "not set " ||
rowid)).  Also, if all you want to do is show your boss that people
are not doing their jobs you can simply run

select updated_by, last_updated, count(*)
from tablename
where field_that_should_not_be_null is null
group by updated_by, last_updated
order by last_updated, updated_by;

Or better yet, modify the schema to make that column not nullable
(which it should be if null is not a valid value).
