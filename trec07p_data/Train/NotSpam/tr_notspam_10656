That doesn't sound right -- from the book:

**************************************
Parameters to use lib are prepended to the beginning of Perl's search path.
Saying use libLIST is almost the same as saying BEGIN { unshift(@INC,LIST)
}, but use libLIST includes support for platform-specific directories. For
each given directory $dir in its argument list, the lib pragma also checks
to see whether a directory named $dir/$archname/auto exists. If so, the
$dir/$archname directory is assumed to be a corresponding platform-specific
directory, so is added to @INC (in front of $dir).
**************************************

I definitely want this, because I have different platforms (os x, linux,
irix) running this script and I'd like them to use the module binary
corresponding to it...

Anybody know how I can make that work?
