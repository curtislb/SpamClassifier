Hi Guys

Thanks for all the help with the directory sorting, I'm still very new
to Perl :)

I'm now trying to use Perl to convert the below log file to CSV.

1176301248.555    180 dhr-hr3.duys.co.za TCP_MISS/200 447 GET
http://support.duys.co.za/DUYSIT/WebResource.axd? - DIRECT/192.168.10.3

Is there any easy way to do this?

Thanks for all the help.
