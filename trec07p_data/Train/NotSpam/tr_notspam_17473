China’s Position paper on IPR Protection        (bold as in original text)



The protection of intellectual property rights (IPR) has an important
bearing on socio-economic development, scientific innovation and cultural
prosperity of a country, to which it is both an international obligation and
a natural requirement in its national development.



China appreciates the inclusion of IPR protection in the agenda of the
Outreach Session by our German host and hopes that efforts will be made, in
a spirit of “equality, mutual benefit, seeking common ground while shelving
difference, taking proactive and practical steps to promote common
development through cooperation!, to listen to the views and take into
account the concerns of all parties, and move international cooperation on
IPR towards mutual benefit and win-win results. China is of the view that:



International cooperation on IPR should be promoted in a balanced and
comprehensive way. Efforts should be made, in the principle of fairness and
justice, to accommodate the needs of countries in different stages of
development, promote coordinated development in IPR creation, management,
application and protection, and strike a balance between IPR protection and
innovation, between obligations and interests, and between public interests
and those of right-holders. Practices like placing too much emphasis on
protection or abusing IPR rules and agreements for technological monopoly
must be avoided.



Institution building should be strengthened through dialogue and
cooperations. Institution building and rules setting should be pursued in a
constructive manner through democratic consultation, consensus building and
seeking common ground while shelving differences. In the absence of
consensus on such issues as approximation of protection standards, more
haste is less speed.



Assistance should be provided to developing countries for capacity building.
In the discussions on technical assistance to developing countries and their
capacity building, it is crucial to take into full account the national
conditions and development levels of the developing countries concerned and
ensure that the real benefits of IPR system are shared by the developing
countries through proper technology transfer and resources allocation, and
the overall national strength of the developing countries are improved.
China commends the G8 initiative to provide technical assistance to
developing countries as outlined in last year’s summit documents and
suggests that specifics of the initiative be contemplated at this year’s
Outreach Session.



The Chinese Government is committed to IPR protection and has made
continuous efforts to advance the cause. Honoring its commitment to relevant
international conventions, China has gradually set up fairly complete legal
and operational frameworks and worked hard in the fileds of legislation, law
enforcement and publicity to constantly raise it ss IPR protection capacity
and level. According to the 11th Five-Year Plan for national development, a
national IPR strategy will be formulated and executed. China is ready to
strengthen exchanges on an equal footing and mutually-beneficial cooperation
with other countries and contribute to the establishment of a sound global
system on the respect and appropriate protection of IPR.
