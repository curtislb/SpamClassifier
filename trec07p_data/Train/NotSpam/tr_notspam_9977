[0]Davis Freeberg writes "TiVo has always been know for thinking outside
of the box, but this week they were awarded an [1]unusual patent related
to locking down content on their hard drives. According to the patent,
they've invented a way to create password security that is so tough, it
would take you [2]longer than the life of a hard drive in order to figure
it out. They could be using this technology to prevent the sharing of
content or it could be related to their advertising or guide data, but if
their decryption technology is really that good, it's an interesting
solution for solving the problem of securing networks."

Techdirt has an quick look at how it is becoming much more common for
people to [0]blame their mistakes on technology. "There are people
driving off cliffs and through flooded roads and taking detours that span
half of England, apparently at the behest of their navigation units.
Things got so bad in one place that authorities even had to put up
"ignore your sat nav" signs. Now, a woman's car got hit by a train, and
for some reason, she's blaming a GPS navigation unit."

C|Net is carrying an article looking into new technology MySpace is
rolling out to [0]combat user violation of copyright laws on their pages.
Called 'Take Down, Stay Down', the service will attempt to ensure that
once content is removed because of a complaint it can never be uploaded
again. "Copyright owners have access to Take Down Stay Down free of
charge, according to a release from MySpace. If the social-networking
service receives a takedown notice regarding a copyrighted clip hosted
through its MySpace Videos hosting service, MySpace's new feature will
take a 'digital fingerprint' of the video and add it to a copyright
filter that blocks the content from being uploaded again. '(It's) the
ability to have a piece of content imprinted and put in a database so we
can identify it,' said Vance Ikezoye, CEO of Audible Magic." The article
goes on to discuss the problems YouTube is facing with the same issues,
as well as recent investigations of this issue in the political arena.

An anonymous reader writes "Google, despite 'doing no evil', has managed
to make itself a number of enemies recently. That's the subject of an
article from the San Francisco Chronicle, which looks into [0]the Davids
looking to slay Goliath. In this strange, strange tale the Davids are the
size of companies like Microsoft and Yahoo, rumoured to be discussing an
alliance to take on the search leader. The list of detractors is longer
than other search providers, though; privacy experts, advertisers,
startups, and Hollywood executives are all frustrated with the company
for one reason or another. 'Despite Google's power, few say the company
strikes as much fear in them as Microsoft did during the 1990s, when its
near-monopoly on computer operating systems earned it the nickname "evil
empire." Google's spotty track record with new products -- few outside of
search have much of a following -- and intense competition with other
Internet companies keeps it a step below. "With Google, there is still
choice," said Chris Le Tocq, an analyst for Guernsey Research, "so I'm
not sure if the 'evil empire' epithet can be equally applied." But he
cautioned that the warning sign will come when Google becomes so dominant
that customers cannot do without it. How well will Google deal with its
customers' problems then?'"

[0]Roland Piquepaille writes "According to BBC News, U.K. researchers
have built [1]a 3-D version of breast cancer in a test tube. Their model
contains cells from normal and cancerous breast tissue. The researchers
used a collagen gel to form 3-D structures to create structures similar
to the ones found in a woman's breast. So far, they focused on a common
pre-cancerous condition known as 'ductal carcinoma in situ' (DCIS). With
this model, they hope to reduce experiments done on animals such as mice.
In fact, these experiments are not always useful because similarities can
be poor between mice and humans. Now it remains to be seen if this model
will be endorsed by the scientific community."

University of Maryland researchers have announced a new "[0]virus sponge"
that could aid in the treatment of, among other things, avian flu. The
sponge woks similar to kidney dialysis, filtering the harmful virus from
the blood. "The virus sponge is based on a technology called molecular
imprinting. In molecular imprinting, researchers stamp a molecule's shape
into a substance (in this case, a hydrogel--a sponge-like material). When
the specific molecule filters through the hydrogel, it fits in the
imprint hole and is trapped."

[1]rethinking how the community distributes Linux and the open source
applications that often come with Linux. The author isn't arguing that
Linux needs to become a full blown web OS over night but instead, asking
if the community should be considering 'Software as a Service' and what
he means by that is perhaps many of the open source applications that run
on Linux should be available through a browser. The reasons for this are
obvious, the code is open so anyone could host it, it would be platform
independent so anyone could use it and it might attract more users to the
Linux environment. The obvious note here is that many of the enterprise
software makers are switching to Software as a Service, shouldn't the
open source community investigate the possibility of a Web OS?"

leading provider of integrated graphics cards, has opened their drivers
as well. But ATI and NVidia, the only two players in the market for
high-performance discrete graphics cards, have so far released only
closed-source drivers for their cards. This has created numerous
compatibility, stability, and ethical problems for users of Linux and
other open source OSes, and prompted projects like [3]Nouveau to try and
reverse-engineer NVidia drivers. Hopefully AMD's decision will put
pressure on NVidia to release open-source drivers as well!"
