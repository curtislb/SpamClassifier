You have to kill Speakup after you start Gnome.  The reason is that when X
starts, it allocates itself a new virtual terminal.  The commands to kill
Speakup only effect the virtual console that they are run from.  Let's say
you are on tty1, which is the case when you first log in.  When X starts, it
will turn TTY1 into a console for error messages and debugging output.  X
will get the first free TTY.  Using Slackware as an example, this will be
TTY7 since Slackware allocates 6 TTYs by default at boot time assuming you
are in run level 3.  Thus, the command to kill Speakup should be given once
Gnome is up and running.  HTH.

Subject: Stopping Speakup while using Gnome.

Hello,  

How can I stop speakup listening for key presses when I'm in gnome?
I've tried pressing the ... I think it's the scrole lock. I cant remember
the name of the button. sorry. it's late. it's the third button in from the
top row on the right. that says you killed speakup. then I press insert and
enter and it says you turned me off but when I'm in gnome and I'm using orca
keystrokes speakup starts talking again.  I don't want to unlode speakup
from memory as I often go back to a console to continue working on other
things so I would really like to know how to just temporarily stop it.  

Or maybe I do need to completely unlode the module.  but, how do I do this
without needing a reboot to get it working again? using modprobe
speakup_apollo doesn't work after using the command rmmod.  
now, I may have that rmmod command wrong. It's been some time since I used
it and as I said, it's late and I'm probably not thinking as clarly as
usual.

Thanks in advance.
