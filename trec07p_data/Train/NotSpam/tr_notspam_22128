$/ is the input seperator.  It is normally set to "\n" (which is why
the <> operator reads line by line), bit it looks like, given your
data, you should set it to "\n\n".  That will get you a record at a
time.  The other issue is slightly more tricky.  If you didn't have
that multiline field you could have easily use two spilts (one to
break the record in to fields and the other to fields into key and
value pairs).  I would suggest splitting each record on "\n", looping
over the results checking to see if the first character is a space,
and appending that line to the last field if it is or creating a new
key/value pair if it isn't.
