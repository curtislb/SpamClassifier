Xavier,

Martin was right (and I should have seen it from the start). The "will
go ahead as much as possible" is true only in the sense that the
greatest possible string of non-digits will be selected for deletion.
With '$s=~s/\D*//;' in line 5 that string will be empty. In order to
delete the trailing string, the '/g' is needed (but I knew that, as I
said in the original post).

Cheers,

Jorge
