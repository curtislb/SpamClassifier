I have an hp compaq nx6325 laptop, and it has no problems as of yet.
I do hate the compaq desktops though, and on a related linux note apparently the laptop has acpi problems and makes the fan mess up so the cpu getts up to 167 f. This is probably why I haven't even tryed putting any linux distro on it.
