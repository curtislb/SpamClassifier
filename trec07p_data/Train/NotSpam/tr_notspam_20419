Hi Gene.
Several weeks ago, you posted a script which you had written to go to the 
wunderground site and pull out the current observation for a given city or 
zipcode.
when I first saw the script in a message on this list, I viewed it with 
Outlook Express, and somehow something got changed in the script.
I had it working for a while but now it just hangs.
Can you tell me where I might obtain a fresh copy or could you send it to 
me off list?
it's a great little script, but what ever happened to the copy I have, I 
can't seem to fix it.
thanks in advance.
