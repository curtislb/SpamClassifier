The purpose of getting the data in the first place is to allow my boss
to see that people are still not doing things they are supposed to.  He
can then send out reminders so we can establish better habits.  My plan
is to replace the null value with a description making it obvious that
the value had not been set instead of just leaving a big ugly blank spot.

Keep up with my goings on at http://theillien.blogspot.com
