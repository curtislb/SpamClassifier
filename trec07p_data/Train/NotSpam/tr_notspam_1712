same answer as the last time you have asked me. what would it be good
for? i'm only remotly a desktop user, and certainly not a desktop developer.

i know. as soon as we consider live-helper (which is rotting in NEW) as
ready, i'll coordinate this. ETA is about 2 to 4 weeks from now.

d-i and g-i on the same images, in terms of seperate boot option are
ready soon. in terms of 'launch d-i/g-i from a booted live-system as an
application', this requires, as far as i'm told, that the d-i people
provides special builds for that purpose.

for the 'live-to-hdd' installation, we will most likely write something
on your own. plan is to have it done until mid of july.

and well, lenny is far, far away...
