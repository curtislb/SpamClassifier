5:20 PM, 6/6/07, Update:  MMT clears Atlantis for launch; engineers brace f=
or evening storms, possible hail=20

NASA's mission management team cleared the shuttle Atlantis for blastoff Fr=
iday on a space station assembly mission delayed three months by hail damag=
e to the ship's external fuel tank. Even as the MMT assessed the shuttle's =
readiness to fly, thunderstorms rumbled toward the Kennedy Space Center and=
 forecasters predicted possible half-inch hail and wind gusts higher than 5=
0 knots at the Kennedy Space Center.

Engineers were scheduled to pump explosive liquid hydrogen and oxygen into =
on-board tanks starting at 6:30 p.m. to power Atlantis' electricity produci=
ng fuel cells. While stormy weather could cause delays, officials said enou=
gh "hold" time was available in the countdown to make up any reasonable amo=
unt of lost time.

The shuttle itself is protected at the launch pad by a large rotating gantr=
y that fits around the vehicle, along with sliding panels that shield the o=
rbiter's wings and belly from hail or other wind-borne debris. But the top =
and back side of the shuttle's external tank are exposed to the elements an=
d the upper section of the tank suffered heavy damage during a freak hail s=
torm Feb. 26.

Work to repair that damage delayed launch from March 15 to this week and wh=
ile the forecast calls for a 70 percent chance of good weather at launch ti=
me Friday, shuttle weather officers predicted afternoon thunderstorms, poss=
ibly severe, today and Thursday.

"The top of the tank is exposed, we can't do anything about that," Launch D=
irector Mike Leinbach said when asked about storms approaching this afterno=
on. "If we get any reports of hail out at the pad, we would do a complete w=
alkdown inspection of the flight hardware and the ground support equipment =
to make sure we were in good shape.

"I hate predicting the weather myself," he said. "We're going to get what w=
e're going to get and we'll deal with it. And this tank will fly perfectly =
fine whether we get a little bit more hail or not. We would have to be so u=
nlucky to get more hail on this tank that... but I'd better not go any furt=
her than that!"

Amid laughter and nods at an afternoon news conference, MMT Chairman LeRoy =
Cain joked: "I'd be real happy if we just stopped talking about hail."

Weather aside, there are no technical problems at pad 39A - last used by sh=
uttle Columbia for its final voyage in 2003 - and Cain said earlier concern=
 about apparently out-of-spec hydrogen pressurization lines on a tank sched=
uled for use by the shuttle Endeavour in August had been resolved with no i=
mpact for Atlantis.

A detailed, 17,000-word mission preview is now posted in the CBS News STS-1=
17 Mission Archive and as part of the CBS News Space Reporters Handbook, av=
ailable on the Downloads page. The first take of the preview also is posted=
 on the Current Mission page.
