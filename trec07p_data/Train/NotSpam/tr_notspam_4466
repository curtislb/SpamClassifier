This is a case of whether or not it is legal to (or strictly speaking,
a violation of an agreement to which the user may be a party when
using) a piece of software in a particular fashion, not whether it is
legal to distribute it.

In general, we deal with cases of the letter on -legal (and in general
in the archive) rather than the former.

I've not closed the bug report myself, but I have made the severity
non-RC. Dima: that's your call; you can wait for more -legal
contributors to weigh in, or you can close the report.
