SENATE COULD RESUME IMMIGRATION DEBATE NEXT WEEK: Senate leaders reached a deal Thursday night to revive stalled
immigration legislation after days of intense talks and a rare presidential salvage mission to the Capitol. Majority
Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) issued a brief joint statement, saying they had
met with key lawmakers and the bill would return to the Senate floor. The Senate could resume debate next week, as soon
as it finishes an energy bill, and would aim to complete it before the end of the month. The bill kicked up fierce
objections among conservatives across the country who derided it as amnesty for illegal immigrants, emboldening Senate
opponents who thwarted attempts to debate the bill. Los Angeles Times: Senate strikes deal to revive immigration bill

DOJ EXAMINING GONZALES-GOODLING MEETING: The Justice Department is investigating whether Attorney General Alberto R.
Gonzales sought to improperly influence the testimony of a departing senior aide, two of its senior officials said
yesterday, adding a new dimension to the troubles already besetting the nation's chief law enforcement official. The
Justice Department officials, in a letter released yesterday by the Senate Judiciary Committee, said their inquiry into
the firings of nine U.S. attorneys includes an examination of a meeting Gonzales held in mid-March with his then-aide
Monica M. Goodling, who testified last month that the attorney general's comments during the session made her feel "a
little uncomfortable." Washington Post: Gonzales Meeting With Aide Scrutinized

LIBBY WILL HAVE TO BEGIN SERVING SENTENCE SOON: I. Lewis Libby Jr., once one of the most powerful men in government,
was escorted by federal marshals out a side door in a federal courtroom here Thursday for processing after a judge
issued a final ruling that he would have to begin serving his 30-month prison sentence shortly, even before his appeals
were exhausted. Mr. Libby, the former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, was temporarily released after
surrendering his passport and completing forms. He will have to report to a federal prison sometime in the next several
weeks to begin serving his sentence after his conviction in March on four felony counts for lying in a C.I.A. leak
investigation that became part of an intense debate over the war in Iraq. New York Times: Delay Denied, Libby Is Seen
as Weeks From Prison http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/15/washington/15libby.html

SCOTUS RULES ON UNION FEES DISPUTE: The Supreme Court yesterday ruled unanimously that states may require public-sector
labor unions to get permission from workers before using their union fees for political activities. The 9-0 decision
applies to government workers who have chosen not to be members of the union. About 21 states, including Washington,
allow unions and government employers to enter into "agency-shop" agreements under which the union can collect fees
from the nonmember workers whom it represents in labor negotiations. At the time the case was brought, however,
Washington also required the union to get explicit prior consent from those nonmembers before using their fees for
lobbying or other political purposes. The Washington Supreme Court ruled that this requirement violated the First
Amendment and infringed on the union's "expressive associational rights," but the Supreme Court disagreed. Washington

FEMA TRYING TO RECLAIM $485 MILLION IN "IMPROPER AID PAYMENTS": The Federal Emergency Management Agency overpaid
victims of the Gulf Coast hurricanes by at least $485 million and is struggling to reclaim the money from tens of
thousands of people it says shouldn't have been given aid, a USA TODAY analysis shows. Agencies such as FEMA routinely
seek repayments after disasters, though never before has the government done so on such a massive scale. Disaster aid
records show that FEMA has so far recovered $15.6 million — about 3 cents for every dollar its auditors have identified
as being improperly paid. A federal judge in New Orleans ordered FEMA late Wednesday to stop trying to collect any
money until it gives aid recipients better explanations of what they owe. FEMA was reviewing the case Thursday,
spokesman Aaron Walker said. The order follows sharp protests from lawyers, lawmakers and residents still struggling to
rebuild nearly two years after Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma obliterated much of the coast. USA Today: $485M

LYNNE CHENEY NOT ON FINAL LIST OF POTENTIAL WY SENATE REPLACEMENTS: The Wyoming Republican Party Thursday evening
released a final list of 31 individuals who had submitted applications to replace the late Sen. Craig Thomas (R) by the
5 p.m. Mountain Time deadline — and Lynne Cheney, wife of Vice President Cheney, was not among them. The list appeared
to offer few surprises, and is headed by known interested parties like Colin Simpson, the Majority Floor Leader of the
Wyoming House of Representatives and the son of former Sen. Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.); just-resigned U.S. Attorney Matt
Mead, the grandson of a former governor and Senator; and state Sen. John Barrasso. "It's got breadth and depth, there
are insiders and outsiders," state GOP Chairman Fred Parady said of the list, in a brief telephone interview. "It's a
great day for democracy. Now we have to go to work." Roll Call: Lynne Cheney Does Not Apply for Wyoming Senate Vacancy

"90 IS THE NEW 80": Age is finally catching up with West Virginia Sen. Robert C. Byrd in the winter of his 54-year
career in Congress. At 89, the longest-serving senator in history and third person in the line of presidential
succession has ceded major duties — such as handling appropriations bills on the Senate floor — to younger colleagues
and aides. Byrd continues to steer pork projects to his home state, rail against President Bush and the Iraq war and
quote Cicero and the King James Bible now and then on the Senate floor. But as he walks haltingly with two canes and an
ever-present assistant, he increasingly seems an anachronism in an Internet-age Congress where some members are young
enough to be his grandchildren. "I'm told that 90 is the new 80," Byrd, a Democrat, said in a statement issued by his
office. "I am proud of my white mane, but I still long for the black hair of my youth." AP via Yahoo! News: Slowed by
age, Byrd relies on colleagues http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070615/ap_on_go_co/byrd_s_twilight

MA "UNEQUIVOCALLY" PROTECTS RIGHTS OF GAYS AND LESBIANS TO WED: The Legislature, in a vote as swift as it was historic,
reaffirmed the state's first-in-the-nation same-sex marriage ruling yesterday, unequivocally protecting the rights of
gays and lesbians to wed in Massachusetts until at least 2012. The vote followed 3 1/2 years of fierce arguments,
emotional testimonies, and controversial legal decisions. It came on a day filled with cheering and jeering in the
streets of Beacon Hill. But when the hour arrived, there was neither debate nor delay. In a packed chamber, first
senators and then House members cast their votes to reject a constitutional amendment that would have defined marriage
in Massachusetts as only a union between a man and a woman. In the end, the proposed ban garnered only 45 votes, five
short of what it needed to qualify for the 2008 statewide ballot and 17 fewer than it won during its first trip through
the Legislature less than six months ago. Boston Globe: Right of gays to marry set for years to come

CLINTONS CONVERT STOCK TO CASH "TO AVOID FINANCIAL CONFLICTS": Bill and Hillary Clinton have dissolved the blind trust
that has managed their investments since they entered the White House in 1993, converting all stocks to cash to avoid
financial conflicts as she runs for president, according to documents to be filed today with federal ethics officials.
The documents reviewed by The Washington Post provide the most complete accounting of how the Clintons accrued the $5
million to $25 million in the trust -- nearly all since leaving the White House -- through investments in foreign
companies, oil giants and drugmakers without their input or knowledge and without public disclosure. Washington Post:

BILL MADE $10 MILLION ON SPEECH CIRCUIT LAST YEAR: Former President Clinton, who might someday be the first spouse,
traveled the globe last year, making more than $10 million giving speeches at corporate retreats, trade group
gatherings and motivational venues. The speaking engagements and their top-dollar fees were detailed in Sen. Hillary
Rodham Clinton's Senate financial disclosure report, made public Thursday. The report showed that the former president
and his presidency-seeking wife had assets of at least $10 million and might have as much as $50 million with no
liabilities. AP via Yahoo! News: Bill Clinton: $10 million haul for talks

CLINTON, OBAMA "DIVIDING FAMILIES" IN BATTLE FOR IL CASH: Hillary Rodham Clinton — New York senator, Yankees fan and
resident of Chappaqua, N.Y. — has a message for presidential rival Barack Obama: Chicago is still my kind of town. In
the frenetic chase for campaign cash, Clinton isn't ceding her one-time home turf to the Illinois senator. The
59-year-old woman, born and raised in the Chicago suburb of Park Ridge, is relying on the help of the state's wealthy
and connected. High-profile attorneys, a philanthropist, longtime Clinton family friends and business leaders,
including a son of the Rev.	   Jesse Jackson, are among the prominent Illinois residents invited to a June 25
fundraiser. While Obama and another top rival, John Edwards, have encroached on Clinton's new home turf of New York to
raise money, Clinton has tapped her Illinois ties and political alliances dating to her years as first lady. It hasn't
been easy in the state she once called home. AP via Yahoo! News: Clinton, Obama fight for Illinois cash

"CRUSH" CLIP PUTS OBAMA CAMP IN "ODD POSITION": Young people can make a difference in politics, Sen. Barack Obama says
in a new campaign video, by speaking up about "the things that are making you passionate." Elsewhere on YouTube, a very
scantily clad young woman is doing exactly that — in an unauthorized music video about her "Crush on Obama" that
features her pole-dancing in a subway car and wearing a pair of "Obama" shorts that barely contain her enthusiasm for
politics. Word of the new music video was spreading swiftly on the Internet Thursday, and, with more than 55,000 views
after less than a day, it was on its way to becoming one of the site's most popular clips. The music video, the launch
gimmick of a new Web site, barelypolitical.com, put the Obama camp in an odd position. True, the woman in the music
video is clearly declaring Obama "the best candidate," arguably a message they'd like to see going viral on the Web.

F. THOMPSON'S CA SUPPORTERS "HAVE NOT BEEN HOLDING THEIR BREATH": California donors to Fred Thompson's Senate campaigns
have not been holding their breath to see if the movie and television celebrity will jump into the presidential race,
instead contributing to the war chests of both Democratic and Republican hopefuls. In the 1990s, the Tennessee
legislator was one of those rare Republicans who showed he can raise a lot of money in Hollywood, as many saw the actor
as one of their own. But in those campaigns there wasn't a Democrat on the other side named Clinton or Obama. While a
few of Thompson's California donors have gone with Democrats, those Republicans who have stayed with the GOP have been
backing former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney or Sen. John McCain (Ariz.).

EDWARDS TALKS HEALTH CARE IN DETROIT: Insurance companies would have to put more money into direct patient care and
drug companies would get cash -- not patents -- for breakthrough drugs under a health care plan detailed Thursday in
Detroit by Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards. "Here in Detroit, the cost of health care is particularly
crippling for business," Edwards said, adding that the U.S. auto industry spends $16 billion annually on such costs.
"These businesses and their unions made a promise to workers, and now it's time for the government to hold up its end
of the bargain and lower health care costs," he said after a tour of the East Riverside Health Center in Detroit. Under
his plan, insurance companies would be required to put 85% of the premiums they collect into patient health care,
rather than administration and profits, which account for about 30% of premiums, said the former U.S. senator from
North Carolina and 2004 vice presidential candidate. Detroit Free Press: Edwards details health care fix

BROWNBACK WILL HIT 27 IA TOWNS IN FOUR DAYS: U.S. Sen. Sam Brownback's presidential campaign plans to target small
towns across Iowa next week in a four-day, 27-stop tour intended to build support for the GOP straw poll Aug. 11 in
Ames. The Kansas Republican, who campaigns frequently on his rural roots, will start Monday in Oskaloosa and stump
through parts of central Iowa near Ames with his wife, Mary, and their two youngest children. The campaign has not
released a detailed schedule. "I'm fully committed to Iowa and the Ames straw poll," Brownback said Thursday in a
conference call. "My Midwestern values will guide me as president, and I think I'm the candidate most in touch with
Iowa voters." Des Moines Register: Conservative Brownback plans campaign tour of small towns

GIULIANI ISSUES "BACKHANDED SLAP" TO W.: Rudy Giuliani took a slap at President Bush yesterday, claiming the country
lacks the "strong, aggressive, bold leadership" of Republican icon Ronald Reagan. Giuliani's bombshell remark - during
a Flag Day rally in Delaware - was a surprise after weeks of his staunch defense of Bush over the Iraq war and other
issues. During his speech near Wilmington, Del., Giuliani said he was concerned that polls show that three-quarters of
Americans think the country is heading in the wrong direction, which he said was partly the result of a lack of
leadership in Washington. The former mayor didn't mention Bush by name but said, "What we're lacking is strong,
aggressive, bold leadership like we had with Ronald Reagan." New York Post: RUDY SUGGESTS BUSH IS NO RONALD REAGAN
