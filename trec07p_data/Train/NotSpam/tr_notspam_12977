Hi,

if you will use latest alsa then you don't need set up dmix. alsa use it
automaticaly. Only you must be carrrefuly if you have on your system
.asoundrc which is not compatible with a new version of alsa but if you
have a new linux installation then will be OK.


For playing you need alsa clients or for oss client you can install
alsa-oss on debian for example. Then you can play with command: aoss
playcommand FILE .

Best
