CNN Tonight: Virginia Tech Gunman Sent Material to Media

NBC News today gave authorities a package of videos and
writings, from the gunman, that he sent between killings!
Tonight, stunning revelations about the gunman
in the deadliest shooting rampage in U.S. history!
A Virginia court order declared him "mentally ill"
and "a danger to himself or others" two years ago!

All this as the first funeral for a victim of
the deadliest shooting spree in U.S. history –
a Virginia Tech professor who had survived the
Holocaust was killed protecting his students.

Plus, victims' friend put a heart-breaking,
human face on the mind-numbing toll of the
deadliest shooting spree in U.S. history.

Tonight only on Larry King Live!
