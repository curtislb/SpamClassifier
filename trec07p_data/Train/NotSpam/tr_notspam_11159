TONIGHT ON THE CBS EVENING NEWS
<http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/eveningnews/main3420.shtml>=20

Here is an early preview of what we are planning for tonight's CBS
EVENING NEWS from Anchor and Managing Editor, Katie Couric...=20

Hi everyone,=20

August marks the two-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina but at least
86,000 families are still living in those white FEMA trailers along the
Gulf Coast. While FEMA may have helped shelter a lot of families, our
investigative team has discovered that the trailers may be toxic to the
people who call them home. Investigative Correspondent Armen Keteyian
will report.=20

Sharyl Attkisson is also reporting from the Gulf Coast. Tonight she'll
have an update on New Orleans and the surrounding area - how far has it
really come since Katrina?=20

In South Carolina last night, Republican presidential candidates took
the stage for their second debate. As our senior political correspondent
Jeff Greenfield will report, there were more than a few sparks. He'll
have the highlights.=20

In health news, we'll look into the Internet and its growing role as a
place to find prescription drugs. But, as Wyatt Andrews will report,
much of that buying and selling is done illegally without prescriptions
- so much that it is catching the attention of legislators on Capitol
Hill.=20

Younger and younger kids are using cell phones - and parents are paying
the price as kids ring up big bills for games, ringtones and other
electronic accessories. The catch: kids don't need a parent's go-ahead
before adding charges their bill. Richard Schlesinger will have the
story as well as some solutions.=20

Finally, we've got a story about possible Irish roots popping up in an
unlikely spot in American politics. According to members of one little
church on the Emerald Isle, records show a potential genealogical
connection to the 2008 presidential race. I'll give you a hint - his
surname isn't O'Malley or O'Connor, but it does start with an "O."=20

I hope you'll join us,=20

broadcast:=20

hooked on PLASTIC. Part of our series Gotta Have It: The Hard Sell to
Kids. This story and much more, Thursday, on the CBS Evening News.=20

TONIGHT ON DAVID LETTERMAN <http://www.cbs.com/latenight/lateshow/>=20

Join Dave tonight on The Late Show with actor Ricky Gervais AND actress
Mary Lynn Rajskub... Also, don't miss a Top Ten List presented by The
Price Is Right host Bob Barker. Plus, musical guest Mavis Staples!=20

________________________________


THURSDAY MORNING ON THE EARLY SHOW
<http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/earlyshow/main500202.shtml>=20

Harry Smith, Hannah Storm, Julie Chen and Russ Mitchell anchor THE EARLY
SHOW from New York. Dave Price will bring us the weather=20

Along with the top news of the day, we will also have the following
stories:=20

GOTTA HAVE IT: ALPHA MOMS: The "Alpha Mom" is educated, affluent and in
charge. She sets the trends, and controls over $500 billion dollars of
total spending. That is why companies are so interested in targeting
"Alpha Moms" with their products. As we continue our series Gotta Have
It, we'll see why these mothers may be influencing the way YOU spend.
EARLY SHOW National Correspondent Tracy Smith will have details.=20

FAREWELL TO BOB BARKER, PART 2: Bob Barker's final "Come on Down" is
coming up fast. But before he leaves The Price is Right for good, Bob
will be honored Wednesday night with a prime time special, looking back
at a half-century of work on the small screen. EARLY SHOW National
Correspondent Hattie Kauffman finds out what Bob is leaving behind: the
adoration of game show contestants from across the nation.=20

JUST ASK A WOMAN. . . ABOUT HER LOOKS: Wednesday morning we continue our
Just Ask A Woman series by looking at women and beauty. In fact, the
anti-aging industry reportedly racks in over $50 billion dollars a year
in sales. EARLY SHOW Contributor Mary Lou Quinlan will join us with
more.=20

PET PLANET: GENTLE BARN: A California woman has devoted her life to
rescuing abused and unwanted farm animals and giving them a second
chance. But she's not stopping there. Those animals are now helping
children with troubled lives of their own. The result is pretty amazing.
Our resident veterinarian, Dr. Debbye Turner will share with us in
Wednesday morning's Pet Planet.=20

ANTONIO BANDERAS ON SHREK THE THIRD: When Spanish heartthrob Antonio
Banderas made his Hollywood film debut in 1992's Mambo Kings, he didn't
speak any English. Now he supplies his voice to the ever so suave Puss
In Boots, who returns in the new animated film Shrek The Third.
Wednesday morning, Antonio will join us to discuss the latest Shrek
film.=20

NEW YORK LIBERTY: WNBA players Shay Doron, Tiffany Jackson, Jessica
Davenport, and the NY Liberty Mascot will join us to talk about the
upcoming season. We'll shoot some hoops with the basketball stars out on
our plaza.=20

BILL GEIST ON WAY OFF THE ROAD: For twenty years, Bill Geist has
delivered the big news from some of America's smallest towns. And, the
Correspondent best known for his reporting for CBS News' Sunday Morning,
has often taken us on quite an adventure. From flying with a paperboy
pilot, to challenging a watermelon champion speed eater, these exploits
and many more are featured in Bill's new book, Way Off The Road: The
Peculiar Charms of Small-Town America. Monday morning, Bill will join us
for more on his adventures and his latest book.=20

BOBBY FLAY'S HOT DOGS: Summer is the perfect time to fire up the grill
and take advantage of the weather by cooking outside. Whether you are
cooking for two or for a Memorial Day weekend get-together, grilling
delicious favorites is quick and easy. How can you make the best tasting
ballpark frank right at home? Our resident chef Bobby Flay will join us
for a special taste of summer hot dogs.=20

CSI PREVIEW: The nail-biting season finale of CSI airs Thursday night.
The CSI team is closing-in on the so-called "Miniature Killer," with
Grissom going as far as making his OWN "miniature" to get inside the
murderer's mind. Thursday morning, we'll get an exclusive "sneak peek"
from the episode in which the team gets a surprising clue into the
killer's identity.=20

"THAT'S THE WAY IT IS: CELEBRATING CRONKITE AT 90" FRIDAY, MAY 18TH
(8-9pmET/PT)=20

The world is a very different place than it was in the 1960s and '70s
when one voice seemed to speak for all Americans and, in so doing, to
bind the nation together. That unique and iconic voice was, of course,
Walter Cronkite's. CBS News will celebrate the legendary newsman's
singular life and career in a CBS News primetime special, "THAT'S THE
WAY IT IS - CELEBRATING CRONKITE AT 90," to be broadcast Friday, May
18th (8:00-9:00 PM, ET/PT) on the CBS Television Network.=20
