Hi all on the list,
Here is an interesting situation I am in.
I have a Windows XP Media Center Edition box that I mainly use for Skype 
reasons and other voice over IP things that Linux sadly does not seem to 
help me with.
Now, I still want to run Linux, but can not do so by whiping out Windows, 
because the last time I did that my father unknown to me tryed to look up 
something online. As you may expect, he only knows Microsoft Windblows, so 
when he saw a Linux login terminal, he shut the system down the hard way 
because he could not figure out how to get back into it.
So, I reinstalled a clone of my working Gateway computer, and because of the 
hardware, Windows XP is actually stable, most of the time believe it or 
not.Now, would it be possible to use VMWare worksation and run Linux and 
isntall it, and use software speech with Speakup? Any considerations that I 
should take into account first? Will this work? Let me know. Regards,--Keith
