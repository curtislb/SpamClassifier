Possible. It's kind of tricky with a template, especially when
dealing with unregistered marks. If you put it in one sentence,
people may limit themselves. If you make people write an exhibit,
they may overdo themselves and hurt their legal position. Or
(maybe worse?) forget to actually _include_ the exhibit, and then what?

Well, that may be so, but I thought the idea was to make a template
license and not a Debian-specific license. A template should also be
suitable for projects or companies that envisage changing scope of
activities.

I don't see why not, as long as my products don't create an
impression that I am affiliated with the Debian project. Since
the Debian project promotes and distributes free software, and
I sell proprietary hardware, it seems to me I can go ahead.

Why do you conclude there is confusion?

The mere fact that I use the name and logo of the project can't
be reason enough to assume affiliation or association. The whole
point of licensing the mark this way is to allow others to use the
name and logo.

One of the factors to determine confusion is how proximate the two
markets are. See for example
http://home.att.net/~jmtyndall/ustm/1114.htm

Ok, so maybe hardware and software are close markets, so the chance 
of confusion is high there. I can get more removed from free software:
I sell clothes with the Debian logo and some witty "Debian says" quote.
Is that creating confusion or affiliation?

I wasn't sure what you were saying in the > > >  part, and jumped
to conclusions. You talked about "IBM, or to Slackware, or to
Microsoft, or to MacOS" and I read that in the context of the
Debian sign. My interpretation was that you wanted the Debian
license to forbid the creation of confusion with *anyone's* logo.
Sorry about that.
