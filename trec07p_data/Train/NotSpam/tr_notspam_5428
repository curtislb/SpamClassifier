I have a number of problems with this:

- It's unclear whether you have a fixed set of variables to process. Is
  the list always the same?

- Why are you using references? Are you sure you need to?

- modify_variable() doesn't appear to modify anything, otherwise why are
  you assigning its return value to the scalar passed as a parameter? It
  seems to be just a function.


>From what I can see, you need no more than:

  $_ = function($_) foreach ($var1, $var2, $var3);

Will this do? Or is there more to the problem than you've explained?
