Yes, I think so. Sometimes the simplest solution is best.

The reason I'm worried is because the copyright holder is the
same entity as the trademark holder. That is a special case.
If I give you an image and you turn it into a sign that's
confusingly similar to Red Hat's logo, you can't argue I gave
you permission to do that. But if I *am* Red Hat and let you
"do whatever you want", you *can* argue that.

True. Again, it's a special case. You are giving people the logo
and telling them "do whatever you want" under copyright. Is
creating a confusingly-similar logo "whatever you want"?

You hope never to go before a jury at all. Settle if you can,
because all bets are off.
