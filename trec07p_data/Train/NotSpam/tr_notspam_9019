I'll tell you what I've done to reduce my carbon footprint--no kids. 
That's a savings that has huge implications as time goes on.

Hey, I'm not buying into the Global Warming Hoax. But, that doesn't stop 
me from ridiculing the hypocrisy of celebrities who do.

If you want to blame someone/thing for global warming, check out the sun 
and cyclical warming/cooling cycles. We were in a cooling period from 
the 1950s to the 1970s, even while our carbon dioxide production was 
skyrocketing--imagine that.

Not too many, I'd guess. All of these Global Warming Alarmists want 
someone else to do all the savings, or they want to get off easy by 
buying the bogus global warming offsets, which are clearly a joke.
