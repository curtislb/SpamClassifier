Jerry,

broken AD installs are _really_ common. One I hit last week had DNS
disabled completely (just doesn't respond on port 53 at all, and no
other DNS server).  Other ones have completely broken ldap setups, or
broken time sync, or any other number of ways that admins have
invented to screw up AD.

It happens because windows clients keep working, so nobody notices
when AD breaks, except the poor sod who has to come into the
enterprise environment and install a Samba server. In many
environments asking for a DC to be fixed properly is just impossible,
so I want some way, any way, of making Samba still be able to work in
those environments.

Cheers, Tridge
