Hiya,
    I managed the install with GRML-debootstrap.  All that I needed to do 
was edit the /etc/debootstrap/config file, which was pretty easy with the 
comments.  Then I ran grml-debootstrap and let it just go.  There were a lot 
of noninteractive messages, which I ignored.  After it was all over,I 
actually didn't need software speech, as I was able to SSH into the system 
from another machine.  Now that I've got Etch, though, I'd like full access 
if possible--well, anyway, as full as the lack of a hardware synth will let 
me.
I hope this helps.  If you've got any questions, feel free to ask, and I'll 
do the best I can to answer.
Thanks,
Zack.
