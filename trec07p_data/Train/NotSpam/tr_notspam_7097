Hi Users...

I want to write a text into a picture with Image::Imlib2
with this line:

$image->draw_text($x, $y, "$text");

before this I define also the font-path, the font-color and load after
the font...

If the text is this:

10/17

all went fine and the text is on the picture...

but if the text is

10°/17° (10 degree / 17 degree)

then the text is only 10 and after it's finish...

what can I do to draw the degree-sign... I don't like to draw a circle
the graphic way... 

Google don't show me a solution...
Thanks a lot for any help.

have nice evening...
Raphael
