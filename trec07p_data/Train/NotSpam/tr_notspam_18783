9:12 AM, 6/13/07, Update: Crew awake; prepares for spacewalk, solar panel r=
etraction=20

Astronauts Patrick Forrester and Steve Swanson are gearing up this morning =
for a planned six-and-a-half-hour spacewalk to finish rigging a massive rot=
ary joint that will slowly turn a newly installed set of solar arrays to ke=
ep them face on to the sun. They also will assist, if necessary, the retrac=
tion of the P6-2B solar array extending at right angles to the long axis of=
 the station and the newly installed S4 arrays. The 115-foot-long P6-2B arr=
ay must be retracted 40 feet or so to provide the clearance necessary for t=
he S4 arrays to rotate and stay face-on to the sun.

But a partial retraction, while acceptable for a brief period, is not accep=
table over the long haul. P6 must be moved by the station's robot arm in Oc=
tober to the left end of the main power truss and the solar array support m=
asts are too fragile to withstand the sort of side-to-side forces they woul=
d experience if the move was attempted with more than just a few of the mas=
t bays extended.

During a shuttle flight last December, astronauts retracted the left-side b=
lanket of the P6 array - P6-4B - but ran into major problems and had to sta=
ge an unplanned spacewalk to fold the balky panels back into their blanket =
box.

This time around, controllers are taking a slower, more deliberate approach=
. Commands were sent early today to pull the central mast supporting the ri=
ght-side blanket in two feet or so to release tension on springs holding th=
e blind-like panels taut. Starting around 10:43 a.m., an attempt will be ma=
de to retract the blankets a full mast bay. If the blankets fold properly, =
retraction will continue. If not, the mast will be re-extended and another =
attempt made.

"Because we think it's very likely that the panels are not going to fold up=
 properly, we initiate the retract (from the ground), we're going to start =
the morning of flight day six, right before our second spacewalk," said sta=
tion Flight Director Kelly Beck. "The ground will actually do some configur=
ation to try to minimize the tension on that array to hopefully give us the=
 best chance for getting that panel to fold right."

If that doesn't work, Forrester and Swanson will provide manual assistance =
at the start of their spacewalk. They have about an hour built into the tim=
eline for P6-2B retraction but after that, they will shift gears and turn t=
heir attention to the right-side solar alpha rotary joint, removing launch =
locks, installing internal braces and positioning a drive motor to engage t=
he main gear.

Additional P6-2B retraction time is built into the flight plan Thursday and=
, if necessary, astronauts Jim Reilly and Danny Olivas will provide more ma=
nual assistance Friday during a third planned spacewalk. A fourth excursion=
 by Forrester and Swanson is on tap Sunday.

For identification, Forrester's call sign today is EV-3 and his spacesuit f=
eatures vertical dash marks on the legs. Swanson's call sign is EV-4 and hi=
s suit features diagonal dashes.

"We were going to go out there and remove a series of launch locks and laun=
ch restraints on that SARJ, that rotary joint, that would allow that extern=
al portion to turn," Forrester said in a NASA interview. "But the program, =
knowing that we might have some problems retracting that other solar array =
wing up there, which is 2B, they=92d like to look ahead at that and so whil=
e Swanny and I are putting our suits on and in the airlock, they will begin=
 to try and retract that solar array.

"If it turns out that they have some problems, they=92ll let us know that b=
efore we come out of the hatch and we=92ll grab a different set of tools an=
d we=92ll head up that direction and be prepared to help with that. If thin=
gs are going well, we probably are still going to go up and get into that v=
icinity for about the first hour of our spacewalk and be ready to help out,=
 give direction, maybe, if we need to, help the solar array panels fold the=
 right way.

The P6 arrays were installed in 2000 to provide power during the early stag=
es of space station assembly. The plan all along was to eventually move the=
m to the left end of the power truss but the 2003 Columbia disaster interru=
pted station assembly and the P6 blankets were left extended much longer th=
an originally intended.

"It=92s almost like folding a map in your car - you know, once you=92ve unf=
olded the first time you think it would be easy to get it back but it=92s n=
ot, and these things have been extended for a while and they have a tendenc=
y to want to fold the wrong direction back on themselves. And so we=92ll ju=
st be ready to help out with whatever is required."

Using custom-built, insulated tools, the spacewalkers can push the blankets=
 along creases to help them fold or manually push grommets along guide wire=
s should any hang ups be spotted.

"I would push along the hinge line if it=92s trying to fold the wrong way,"=
 Forrester said. "The other thing is. that sometimes there=92s a possibilit=
y that these guide wires that help guide the solar array down into the box =
can get hung up on the panels themselves, in which case I=92ll use this sam=
e tool or another tool that they have kind of manufactured and help that, a=
ssist that along the hinges or the where the guide wires run through the pa=
nels themselves. And the other part is just watching and being up there to =
help direct as they=92re doing the commands inside the space station."

But Forrester and Swanson will only spend an hour or so on the P6 retractio=
n. After that, even if the array remains hung up, they will turn their atte=
ntion to getting the starboard SARJ activated.

"Even if we run into a lot of problems, we=92re only going to devote about =
the first hour of our spacewalk to (P6-2B retraction)," Forrester said. "At=
 that point, they=92ll have enough information on the ground to begin to pr=
epare for the next spacewalk, and we will move out to the SARJ and begin th=
e spacewalk that we had already trained for."

The S3 solar alpha rotary joint, or SARJ, is equipped with two redundant mo=
tors that drive a large gear to slowly spin the outboard solar arrays at 4 =
degrees per minut so they can stay roughly face on to the sun as the statio=
n flies through each 90 minute orbit. Power from the arrays, along with dat=
a and computer commands, passes through the center of the SARJ without rega=
rd to orientation.

Before the SARJ can be activated, both motors, called drive lock assemblies=
, must be manually engaged and then precisely positioned by flight controll=
ers to ensure the drive teeth mesh properly with the main gear. Braces must=
 be positioned, launch locks and thermal shrouds removed, along with a keel=
 pin used to help mount the S3/S4 truss segments in the shuttle's cargo bay.

In addition, the astronauts must prepare rails on the front face of the new=
 segments to extend the "track" used by the mobile transporter to carry the=
 station's robot arm to and from various work sites.

During today's spacewalk, Forrester and Swanson will concentrate on positio=
ning the second DLA, removing the remaining launch locks and installing the=
 necessary braces to stiffen the truss segment as required.

"We are going out to remove a series of launch locks," Forrester said. "The=
re=92s 16 of them that are holding this rotary joint, keeping it from turni=
ng. That=92s mainly because of the launch loads in the shuttle. And so once=
 we get out there, they=92re all covered by thermal covers, and we=92ll rem=
ove those covers then reach in and remove those launch locks. They are basi=
cally about a 10-by-12 steel plate being held on by four bolts. We=92ll rem=
ove those launch locks and then we=92ll put those thermal covers back on fo=
r protection, and we=92ll bring those 16 launch locks in.

"There are also six launch restraints that we will remove," he said. "There=
 are several other pieces of structure that help just strengthen the actual=
 truss section. Those were not installed for launch also, so there=92s a li=
ttle flexibility as the shuttle kind of shakes and bends on the way up ther=
e, that the truss would not be damaged. So it=92s really just preparation t=
o be able to rotate the solar array."

During installation of the P3/P4 truss segments last September, spacewalker=
s Dan Burbank and Steve MacLean rain into problems with supposedly captive =
washers that floated away during removal of the port SARJ launch locks. Mor=
e troubling, it took all their combined strength and about a half hour of w=
ork to free one stuck bolt that could have prevented the SARJ from rotating.

This time around, Forrester and Swanson will be equipped with a custom-buil=
t "torque multiplier" to permit them to apply the force necessary to free t=
ight bolts without stripping the any threads.

"They took a torque multiplier that=92s in the inventory, that was used for=
 shuttle payloads, and we have modified it so that it will fit on these bol=
ts," Forrester said. "Using that, we don=92t think we=92ll have any problem=
 pulling any of the launch restraints off."

degrees per minut so they can stay roughly face on to the sun as the statio=
n flies through each 90 minute orbit. Power from the arrays, along with dat=
a and computer commands, passes through the center of the SARJ without rega=
rd to orientation.<BR>
<BR>
Before the SARJ can be activated, both motors, called drive lock assemblies=
, must be manually engaged and then precisely positioned by flight controll=
ers to ensure the drive teeth mesh properly with the main gear. Braces must=
 be positioned, launch locks and thermal shrouds removed, along with a keel=
 pin used to help mount the S3/S4 truss segments in the shuttle's cargo bay=
.<BR>
<BR>
In addition, the astronauts must prepare rails on the front face of the new=
 segments to extend the &quot;track&quot; used by the mobile transporter to=
 carry the station's robot arm to and from various work sites.<BR>
<BR>
During today's spacewalk, Forrester and Swanson will concentrate on positio=
ning the second DLA, removing the remaining launch locks and installing the=
 necessary braces to stiffen the truss segment as required.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We are going out to remove a series of launch locks,&quot; Forrester =
said. &quot;There&#146;s 16 of them that are holding this rotary joint, kee=
ping it from turning. That&#146;s mainly because of the launch loads in the=
 shuttle. And so once we get out there, they&#146;re all covered by thermal=
 covers, and we&#146;ll remove those covers then reach in and remove those =
launch locks. They are basically about a 10-by-12 steel plate being held on=
 by four bolts. We&#146;ll remove those launch locks and then we&#146;ll pu=
t those thermal covers back on for protection, and we&#146;ll bring those 1=
6 launch locks in.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There are also six launch restraints that we will remove,&quot; he sa=
id. &quot;There are several other pieces of structure that help just streng=
then the actual truss section. Those were not installed for launch also, so=
 there&#146;s a little flexibility as the shuttle kind of shakes and bends =
on the way up there, that the truss would not be damaged. So it&#146;s real=
ly just preparation to be able to rotate the solar array.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
During installation of the P3/P4 truss segments last September, spacewalker=
s Dan Burbank and Steve MacLean rain into problems with supposedly captive =
washers that floated away during removal of the port SARJ launch locks. Mor=
e troubling, it took all their combined strength and about a half hour of w=
ork to free one stuck bolt that could have prevented the SARJ from rotating=
.<BR>
<BR>
This time around, Forrester and Swanson will be equipped with a custom-buil=
t &quot;torque multiplier&quot; to permit them to apply the force necessary=
 to free tight bolts without stripping the any threads.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;They took a torque multiplier that&#146;s in the inventory, that was =
used for shuttle payloads, and we have modified it so that it will fit on t=
hese bolts,&quot; Forrester said. &quot;Using that, we don&#146;t think we&=
#146;ll have any problem pulling any of the launch restraints off.&quot;<BR>
