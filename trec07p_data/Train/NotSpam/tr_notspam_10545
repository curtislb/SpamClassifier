---------- Original Message ----------------------------------

Dear friends
I am not sure you have seen the below: This is a leaked version of the
draft G8 communique on Intellectual Property Rights.
This is BAD NEWS and needs our attention  and advocacy in the time to
come!! I have deleted name etc of the person I got it from - since this is
"leaked news" and I am not sure how widely it has been spread. But no
reason to keep this BAD TEXT  to ourselves - we need some massive lobby on
this, I believe.
AM
