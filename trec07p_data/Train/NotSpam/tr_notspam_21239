11:50 AM, 6/21/07, Update: Atlantis entry delayed at least one orbit due to=
 weather=20

Entry flight director Norm Knight ordered the Atlantis astronauts to hold u=
p re-entry preparations and to delay their return to Earth by at least one =
orbit because of low clouds and predicted thunderstorms near the Kennedy Sp=
ace Center.

While forecasters are not optimistic, Knight has not yet ruled out a possib=
le deorbit rocket firing one orbit later, at 2:25 p.m., for a landing on ru=
nway 15 around 3:30 p.m. If the weather doesn't improve, commander Rick Stu=
rckow and his crewmates - pilot Lee Archambault, flight engineer Steve Swan=
son, Patrick Forrester, Danny Olivas, Jim Reilly and returning space statio=
n astronaut Sunita Williams - will remain in orbit an additional day and tr=
y again Friday.
