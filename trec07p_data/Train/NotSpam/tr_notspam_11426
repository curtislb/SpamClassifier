Cabot Wealth Advisory - Privacy and Security

34 Years Later, Mr. Feldmar is Busted

The Country Where There is No Concept of Privacy

My Favorite Security Stock

==

A news story caught my attention recently, and I reprint it here in its
entirety, as originally published in Canada's national newspaper, the
Globe and Mail.

April 25, 2007
VANCOUVER -- Nearly 40 years ago, a young psychotherapist embraced
two-thirds of LSD guru Timothy Leary's advice to the Sixties generation to
"turn on, tune in and drop out."

Curious how LSD and other hallucinogens might be used in treating
patients, Andrew Feldmar turned on and tuned in himself.

But he never dropped out. And, no fan of the late Dr. Leary, Mr. Feldmar
took his last hit of acid in 1974.

Thirty-two years, however, turned out to be but an instant in the long,
unrelenting U.S. war on drugs. Last summer, in an incident that has just
come to light, Mr. Feldmar, now 66, was banned from entering the United
States because of his long-ago use of LSD.

Because Mr. Feldmar had never been charged with possession of the once
popular illegal drug, privacy advocates are even more alarmed by the way
U.S. border guards at the busy Peace Arch crossing near Vancouver found
out about it.

The guards simply looked up Mr. Feldmar on the Internet and discovered his
own article about using LSD, written for the scholarly, peer-reviewed
journal Janus Head.

Eugene Oscapella, an Ottawa lawyer involved in privacy issues for 20
years, said the incident sends a frightening message to Internet users,
particularly those who bare their souls online. "Don't ever put anything
about any illegal activity on the Internet," Mr. Oscapella warned
yesterday. "It leaves a digital footprint for all to see, and it's there
forever. "

"We've gone beyond Orwellian measures. The state can now do things with a
flick of the switch that used to be incredibly labour intensive."

Given the United States' "almost fanatical position on drugs," Mr.
Oscapella said, even a teenager who simply writes in a blog about smoking
marijuana is now vulnerable to online scrutiny by U.S. border guards.

"It's an awful situation. Maybe you're somewhere on YouTube or Facebook.
They just have to Google your name. I don't think kids understand the
consequences."

"It's not like you can just burn your notebooks any more," he said.   
"This is forever, folks."

As for Mr. Feldmar, a prominent Vancouver psychotherapist with a long list
of published articles and academic achievements, he still has trouble
comprehending what happened on his bad trip trying to cross into the
United States.

"Over 30 years ago, I did some acid. So what? I just couldn't believe they
would not let me in," he said over the phone, during a break in his busy
practice.

"I've been going to the States for years, and I'd never been stopped
before. My kids used to call me the Border Jedi. It was surreal."

He said he doesn't know why border guards chose this time to question him
further, prompting their Internet search. "Perhaps they didn't believe my
story that I was going to Seattle to pick up a friend at the airport. Who
knows?"

Mr. Feldmar was held at the border for five hours, before being allowed to
return to Canada after signing an admission that he had once violated the
U.S. Controlled Substance Act.

He said he signed out of fear that he might be kept in custody even longer
if he refused.

Willie Hicks, public affairs officer for the border crossing, said
yesterday that Mr. Feldmar admitted violating U.S. drug laws in a sworn
statement.

"I don't make the laws. That's the policy, and we enforce the laws at the
border. It is up to the discretion of our officers who gets to go
across."

Mr. Feldmar is now banned permanently from entering the United States,
unless he applies for and receives a waiver.

After months of consideration, Mr. Feldmar said he has decided not to
apply for a waiver, despite the hardship of not being able to visit his
two adult children, who live in Los Angeles and Denver.

"It's too degrading," he said. "I would probably have to lie [about using
LSD] and say I was rehabilitated. But rehabilitated from what?

 "I feel I was punished because I happened to write about using LSD.
Otherwise, how would they have known?"

At one point in his 2001 article, Mr. Feldmar describes an acid trip with
renowned and controversial psychotherapist R. D. Laing.

"I looked into Ronnie's eyes and saw myself reflected there," he wrote. "I
felt unworthy and flooded with shame. Then I felt accepted . . ."

"The window was open and rainy, moist, cool air streamed in. Birds sang. I
sipped tea from a tea-bowl that my wife had made. I noticed my reflection
on the steaming tea."

Asked why he stopped taking LSD in 1974, Mr. Feldmar replied: "Many people
who experimented with drugs at that time moved on. You learn from them,
and then you graduate."

==

Obviously, privacy isn't what it used to be.  And with the combined forces
of the Internet and the Patriot Act, it never will be again.

The greater security achieved through these measures is certainly welcome.
 Though Mr. Feldmar appears to pose no threat to U.S. security, there's no
doubt that the Internet does help law officials catch criminals.

But we pay a price for this security, and it's not just financial.   
At the extreme, these measures curtail our liberty, and that's a right
I've long valued.

In fact, back in my college days, I dabbled in philosophy for a while
before drifting into the path that eventually resulted in an English
degree.  My favorite philosopher was John Stuart Mill, and my favorite
book of his was "On Liberty," followed closely by "Utilitarianism. "  Both
books are still on my bookshelf today and this past weekend I reread parts
of "On Liberty" for the first time since then.

The thesis of the book, which I've carried in my head these past few
decades, is that each individual has the right to act as he wants, as long
as these actions do not harm others.  Of course, the concept of "harm" can
be stretched far beyond bodily injury:  Lawyers today are expert at
claiming all sorts of damages, including psychological and emotional.

But the main point is clear, and extends to the point that it's perfectly
acceptable to harm yourself, as long as you don't harm others in the
process.

In any event, it's hard to imagine 66-year-old Mr. Feldman -- given the
facts known -- being a danger to either other individuals or society as a
whole.  But because he admitted to breaking the law 34 years ago, he's now
banned from entering the U.S.

How Does Cabot Pick Emerging Markets Stocks?

Paul Goodwin, editor of Cabot China & Emerging Markets Report, looks for
promising companies benefiting from the rapid growth in the economies of
the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China). These companies must
also meet strict criteria regarding fundamentals and technicals. These
recommendations will have healthy balance sheets and will show solid
growth.

Visit the link below to see the explosive profits from the fast-growing
opportunities Paul recommends. See how your $5,000 can soar to $10,000,
$15,000, $25,000 - or more - over the next two to three years.

It's a curious world.  On the one hand, liberties are being curtailed.  On
the other hand, outlets for individual expression multiply.  Both YouTube
and MySpace, for example, encourage public expression of individual
details.  And even if we do no "self-publicizing," the digitals records of
our lives proliferate.

Amazon's record of books I've bought is no doubt quite revealing, as are
the records held by my credit card company.  My favorite airline knows
where I've flown and when.  The federal government knows when I leave the
country and when I return.  And even the organization that administers my
E-Z Pass, which makes it possible to zoom through toll gates from Maine
through Virginia without stopping, knows so much about me that they might
retroactively start sending out speeding tickets, based on the time it
took me to travel from one toll plaza to the next.

At bottom, the increasing availability of personal data, combined with the
government's increasing appetite to collect and use that data, make our
lives less private in the long run.

And you know what?  That makes us more like China!

I say this because my daughter in Beijing recently wrote a piece about
cultural differences between the U.S. and China, and one segment dealt
with privacy.  Here's an excerpt:

"Being in a crowd of Chinese people often feels like being a gumball near
the bottom of the machine as someone turns the lever. "Personal Space" is
not a concept here. If you're not physically present in the space, someone
else can be there. Even if you're in the space an atom over.  They drive
the same way. As long as the taxi isn't actually in the same place as the
bus, it's all good. There is no buffer zone around the bus where the taxi
shouldn't be. Same goes for pedestrians, bicycles and horse-drawn carts.
An inch, a centimeter, a hair's breadth away - all acceptable. Which can
be just a little bit terrifying for passengers and pedestrians used to a
little breathing room."

"Same holds true in conversation. I can't tell you how many times someone
about a foot shorter than me has stood an inch away from my collarbone to
tell me something. And then stayed there, for an entire conversation.
You'd think it would hurt their necks.  All of these close encounters are
actually tied to one fundamental difference between Chinese and American
culture. The idea of privacy as we know it just doesn't exist here. We
actually had a Chinese lesson on the subject in which the word privacy was
written in English throughout the lesson to emphasize its
non-translateableness. There just isn't an equivalent concept, so there's
no word for it."

==

And that brings me to the stock of the day.  It's a Chinese company that
makes and installs security cameras and recording devices.   
Similar devices are in use all over the world, particularly in big cities;
London has tens of thousands installed; they're on all major street
corners.  New York has about 10,000.  And China has far, far fewer,
meaning there's a much larger domestic market opportunity . . . especially
because the Chinese have no concept of privacy!

This stock was first recommended by Paul Goodwin, editor of Cabot China &
Emerging Markets Report, back in February, and here's what he wrote.

"China Security (CSCT) is a player in the fast-developing market for the
cameras, recorders and other monitoring devices that people in the West
take for granted. China hasn't needed this equipment, but rapid
industrialization and economic development is changing that."

"Between organic demand growth and huge legislative mandates, the market
for S & S equipment has been expanding at a 45% rate. The company's
products are fairly standard, but two things, 1) the Beijing Olympics and
2) the national surveillance initiative as part of China's Safe Cities
Project, will create an enormous state-mandated demand."

"CSST seems well-positioned to get its fair share. The company is active
in acquiring firms with complementary products and distribution networks.
. . Cabot's take: The stock has been in a strong uptrend since August,
rising from 4 to 16 in mid-January. It has now pulled back to its 50-day
moving average at 12 and shows signs of getting moving again. Opinion:
Positive."

In retrospect, that was a great buy point.  Since then the stock has
climbed as high as 18!  But now it's fallen back down below 14, and to me,
the stock seems to be nearing another attractive buy point, technically.

But a few things have changed since February on the fundamental side.

First, on April 9, the company announced that it had secured thirty-nine
new contract wins that are expected to result in approximately $32 million
in revenues in the second quarter.  The new contracts include citywide
security and surveillance contracts, as well as installations in cyber
cafes, factories, railway stations and corporate locations.

The next day, the stock peaked at $18.10.  (Note for beginners: stocks
peak when perception is highest, and frequently, that's after good news is
announced.)

Then, on May 11, the company announced the completion of one acquisition
and the expected completion of two additional acquisitions by the end of
the second quarter.

The first was HighEasy Electronic Technology.  For just $10.4 million,
China Security and Surveillance gets the firm's leading data compression
technology, useful in sending large amounts of video data across
telecommunications networks.

The second is Changzhou Mingking Electronics.  For $26 million, China
Security & Surveillance gets China's top manufacturer of high-speed dome
cameras, which can view 360 degrees, pan, zoom and tilt, all at high
speed.

And the third is Hangzhou Tsingvision Intelligence System Company.   
For $13 million, China Security gets China's leading developer and
solution provider of intelligence management platforms for network video.

All acquisitions, which will be accomplished with both cash and stock, are
expected to be beneficial in the long run, but in the short run, they will
cost money and require time and money to integrate.

So that's where the stock's correction began.  And then, two weeks later,
came the news that the company would issue $50 million in guaranteed
senior unsecured convertible notes to Citadel Equity Fund.  Short-term,
that's more bad news.  But they had to pay for those acquisitions
somehow!

Finally, two nights ago, the first quarter earnings report was released. 
Revenues were $38.5 million, up 164% from the year before, while earnings
were $0.20 per share, up 67% from the year before.   
Those numbers are good, but they represent slowing growth.  One factor -
the company has been cutting some prices in a competitive environment.

As a result of all this "bad news," the stock has corrected from 18 to
under 14, for a decline of over 25%.  If you like the long-term prospects
(I do), it seems fairly attractive down here.

One caveat:  The average daily trading volume for CSCT is 208,000 shares. 
That's thin, so the stock's progress, both up and down, is not as orderly
as most.  The stock does not qualify for listing on the Nasdaq market yet;
it's traded on the Bulletin Board.  But if you're nimble, I believe this
stock presents some great opportunities for profit.
