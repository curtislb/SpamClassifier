well, that seek failure is a result of the stream nature of stdin and
not a failure of perl. remember that open and much of the i/o layers
(regardless of perl I/O's rewrite) are just wrappers around the OS and
libc calls. i don't see how to dwim them all together (but IO::All does
that in a wacky dwim way). i have never felt the need for super smart
iterators so i can change looping over lines to looping over a
dir. maybe you might have a set of filenames in file vs a dir of
names. but i just don't run into that need. sometimes mappings like that
are just overkill IMO.

enough from me on this. as with the rest of p6 i will work with whatever
is decided by @larry.
