This is more a problem with machine timing than anything, try the following 
I need this with the new rom versions of the doubletalk as well:
speakup26 speakup_synth=ltlk speakup_ser=0 debconm/priority=low
The last is just my personal preference. If I force the port, I find the 
synth; I don't if not.
