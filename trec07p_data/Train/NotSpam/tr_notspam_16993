KEI Policy Blogs: New KEI research note on Patent Pools
Source: http://www.keionline.org/index.php?option=com_jd-wp&Itemid=39
Post: June 6th, 2007 by Judit Rius Sanjuan

KEI has published a new research note on patent pools. This is a survey
of 35 different existing and proposed patent pools, covering different
technologies and time periods, beginning in the nineteen century through
the present.

Patent pools have been widely used to achieve a number of different
objectives, including some that were anticompetitive, and others that
improved social welfare. As the title of the research note indicates,
the research shows a variety of purposes and management structures.
There is no single reason for creating a patent pool, and no single way
to manage a patent pool.

The Research Note is available on html and pdf formats here:
