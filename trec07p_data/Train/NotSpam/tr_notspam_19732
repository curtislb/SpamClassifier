infringement case. eBay has been involved in a legal dispute over the use
of its popular "Buy it Now" button, which allows consumers to skip the
bidding and purchase items on eBay directly. The patent suit was filed
six years ago by MercExchange L.L.C. In May of 2003, a jury ruled in
MercExchange's favor finding that eBay did in fact infringe on the
patent, but in 2005 the US Supreme Court ruled that MercExchange was not
automatically entitled to a court order blocking the offending service,
essentially handing a victory down to patent reform advocates. However,
the ruling by the Supreme Court does not affect the final judgment of the
court."

[0]Pabugs writes with a CNN story about an uncomfortable development in
world politics and information technology. According to General Robert
Elder, an Air Force military man setting up a 'cyber command' in
Louisiana's Barksdale Air Force Base, the nation of China is already in
the process of [1]developing their own 'cyber warfare' techniques. While
Elder described the bulk of China's operations as focusing on espionage,
they and others around the world have more serious goals in mind. "The
Defense Department said in its annual report on China's military power
last month that China regarded computer network operations -- attacks,
defense and exploitation -- as critical to achieving "electromagnetic
dominance" early in a conflict. China's People's Liberation Army has
established information warfare units to develop viruses to attack enemy
computer systems and networks, the Pentagon said. China also was
investing in electronic countermeasures and defenses against electronic
attack, including infrared decoys, angle reflectors and false-target
generators, it said."

brownsteve writes "Eastman Kodak Co. has unveiled what it says are '[0]next-generation
color filter patterns' designed to more than double the light sensitivity
of CMOS or CCD image sensors used in camera phones or digital still
cameras. The [1]new color filter system is a departure from the widely
used standard [2]Bayer pattern — an arrangement of red, green and blue
pixels — also created by Kodak. While building on the Bayer pattern, the
new technology adds a 'fourth pixel, which has no pigment on top,' said
Michael DeLuca, market segment manager responsible for image sensor
solutions at Eastman Kodak. Such 'transparent' pixels — sensitive to all
visible wavelengths — are designed to absorb light. DeLuca claimed the
invention is 'the next milestone' in digital photography, likening its
significance to ISO 400 color film introduced in the mid-1980's."

frequencies. Preliminary results, shared with a conference on body
networks in Florence, Italy, this week, show that bones can conduct even
low-power vibrations with few errors. The idea is that the conduction of
sound along bone would be more secure that via radio waves, leading to
the possibility of swapping data with someone by shaking their hand."

[0]amigoro writes with a link to the Press Esc blog, discussing a
[1]possible replacement for crude oil in plastics, fuels, and other
industrial uses. The post outlines findings to be published in an
upcoming issue of the journal Science. Essentially, researchers at the
Institute for Interfacial Catalysis are attempting to process the sugars
in plant matter into an oil-like compound, a daunting challenge.
"Glucose, in plant starch and cellulose, is nature's most abundant sugar.
'But getting a commercially viable yield of HMF from glucose has been
very challenging,' Zhang said. 'In addition to low yield until now, we
always generate many different byproducts,' including levulinic acid,
making product purification expensive and uncompetitive with
petroleum-based chemicals. Zhang, lead author and former post doc Haibo
Zhao, and colleagues John Holladay and Heather Brown, all from PNNL, were
able to coax HMF yields upward of 70 percent from glucose and nearly 90
percent from fructose while leaving only traces of acid impurities."

madison writes to mention coverage at ZDNet on [0]the future of Intel
technology. Multicore chips are their focus for the future, and
researchers at the company are working on methods to adapt them for
specific uses. The article cites an example were the majority of the
cores are x86, with some accelerators and embedded graphics cores added
on for added functionality. "Intel is also tinkering with ways to let
multicore chips share caches, pools of memory embedded in processors for
rapid data access. Cores on many dual- and quad-core chips on the market
today share caches, but it's a somewhat manageable problem. "When you get
to eight and 16 cores, it can get pretty complicated," Bautista said. The
technology would prioritize operations. Early indications show that
improved cache management could improve overall chip performance by 10
percent to 20 percent, according to Intel." madison also writes, "In
another development news Intel has updated its Itanium roadmap to include
[1]a new chip dubbed 'Kittson' to follow the release of Poulson. That
chip will be based on a new microarchitecture that provides higher levels
of parallelism."

neck and shoulder blade, was likely manufactured in New Bedford, on the
southeast coast of Massachusetts, a major whaling center at that time. It
was probably shot at the whale from a heavy shoulder gun around 1890.' "

article at HotHardWare goes into significantly [1]more detail on the
platform and showcases many more performance metrics on a Windows Vista
64-bit installation. The [2] POV-Ray and Cinebench 95 benchmark numbers
alone are something to smile about. 'Intel's V8 isn't about promoting a
platform as much as it is a show of strength and a glimpse of things to
come. What V8 and QuadFX show is that both Intel and AMD are on a path to
offering true, enthusiast-class, dual-socket platforms. And that's a good
thing. Perhaps AMD is a little further down the path thanks to a more
tweaker-friendly motherboard in the QuadFX-compatible Asus L1N64-SLI WS,
but until consumers have more motherboards to choose from and perhaps
quad-core processors from AMD, we can't very well declare that the time
for QuadFX has arrived. One motherboard does not a platform make.'"

Charleston, South Carolina, Anderson Cooper will host presidential
debates in which debaters are asked 20-30 questions [1]culled from a
specially designated section of YouTube, where the voting populace can
post questions directly. You and I (assuming you're American, probably)
can ask questions ourselves, not just a reporter in a crowd. Candidates
won't know which questions they are being asked, and the video selection
process will remain a complete secret. Interesting, but also [2]the
slightest bit scary."

Raver32 writes with the news that a [0]partial restoration of computer
control was established on the International Space Station (ISS)
Thursday. Systems controlling critical elements like navigation and
life-support failed on Wednesday. "Flight controllers were able to
re-establish some communication with the computers overnight, with
Russian engineers working Thursday to restore the rest of the system,
NASA space station flight director Holly Ridings said. The U.S. space
agency and Russian officials are still trying to determine the cause of a
failure affecting multiple computers in the Russian network ... Since an
earlier failure on Monday, thrusters on the space shuttle Atlantis have
been fired periodically to help maintain the station's position. The
Russian and U.S. space agencies said they could extend Atlantis's mission
by one or two days to fix the problem. In the worst-case scenario, NASA
said the ISS crew members -- two Russians and an American -- may be
evacuated from the station."

[0]wjamesau writes "The war between telecoms and VOIP heats up: according
to Om Malik, [1]T-Mobile UK is refusing to interconnect with mobile VoIP
provider Truphone, a UK start-up with a mobile VoIP client that enables
calls cheaper than mobile. 'T-Mobile told Truphone, that as a result of a
policy decision, they don't connect to VoIP-based low cost calling
services. T-Mobile UK's decision to block Truphone might have come as a
response to the new and radically better Truphone 3.0 client that allows
you to send Free SMS messages and allows VoIP calls over 3G. According to
M:Metrics, nearly 86% of UK mobile users are heavy SMS users, and that
means it is a cash cow that carriers like T-Mobile can't afford to be
slaughtered by IP-based SMS services.' Can mobile companies successfully
crush VOIP competitors like this?"

macduffman writes "Congress and the Department of Homeland Security are

travelers to [0]register their travel plans online 48 hours in advance.
Business advocacy groups are worried about both foreign relations and the
economic impact of such legislation, while privacy concerns see this as
another possible 'in' for identity thieves. From the article: 'Along with
online registration, the updated program would require new and existing
member countries to improve data-sharing; more rigorously report lost and
stolen passports (not just blank passports); and guarantee they will
repatriate nationals if those people are ordered out of the United
States. "It's really a 21st-century model," said James Carafano, a
Heritage Foundation analyst who specializes in homeland security. "It'll
all be done electronically and biometrically. And it really doesn't
compromise your privacy."'"

An anonymous reader writes "A bill introduced this week [0]would force
cable operators to offer à la carte cable and so-called family-tiers of
service. Those opting for à la carte programming would get refunds on
their cable bill, but the legislation would also extend broadcast
indecency standards to cable and satellite TV for the first time: 'In
accordance with the indecency and profanity policies and standards
applied by the [FCC] to broadcasters, as such policies and standards are
modified from time to time, not transmit any material that is indecent or
profane on any channel in the expanded basic tier of such distributor
except between 10pm and 6am.' As Ars points out, 'With the parental
controls built into every television set, set-top box, and DVR being sold
these days, the need for such legislation seems questionable at best.
Unlike broadcast television, which is available to anyone with a TV and
an antenna, people subscribe to and pay for cable/satellite.'"
