05:30 p.m., 04/26/07, Update: Shuttle repairs move into critical phase; NAS=
A opts to bring Williams down from station aboard Atlantis in June

Repairs to the shuttle Atlantis' hail-damaged external fuel tank are going =
relatively smoothly, with the first of two large-area foam sprays scheduled=
 to begin as early as Sunday. While rollout to launch pad 39A has slipped s=
everal days to around May 15, NASA managers say a launch June 8 is still po=
ssible, although the schedule is very tight.

Shuttle managers today also approved a plan to bring space station astronau=
t Sunita Williams back to Earth aboard Atlantis in June. Williams was launc=
hed to the station aboard the shuttle Discovery in December and before Atla=
ntis was damaged by hail during a freak storm in February, she was schedule=
d to come home aboard the Endeavour in June.

But because of the work to repair Atlantis, Endeavour's flight has slipped =
to August. NASA managers monitor the cumulative radiation long-duration cre=
ws are exposed to and while Williams faced no specific health threat remain=
ing in space through August, sources said there was some concern that her t=
otal exposure might preclude any future station flights. By coming home in =
June as originally planned, she likely will remain eligible for a future fl=
ight assignment.

But moving her return up to June also meant moving her replacement, astrona=
ut Clay Anderson, from Endeavour to Atlantis. NASA managers are debating wh=
ether to add an astronaut to Endeavour's crew to help out with moving equip=
ment and supplies back and forth between the shuttle and the station.

The crew rotation was approved by NASA managers today "after a more detaile=
d review determined there would be no impact on space station operations or=
 future shuttle mission objectives," NASA said in a statement. "Since an ea=
rlier crew rotation was possible, NASA managers decided it would be prudent=
 to return Williams and deliver Anderson sooner rather than later."

As a result, the duration of Williams' flight will be roughly the same as o=
riginally planned and on her return, she will set a new space endurance rec=
ord for female astronauts. She already holds the record for spacewalks by a=
 female flier with 29 hours and 17 minutes of EVA time during four excursio=
ns.

Told of the decision earlier today, Williams said she was looking forward t=
o seeing the crew of Atlantis.

"It's going to be a fun flight, hopefully putting on that next solar array =
and retracting the other one," she said, referring to an array that must be=
 retracted so it can be moved later. "It should be a lot of fun, looking fo=
rward to it. Thanks for the news."

NASA managers had hoped to launch Atlantis on mission STS-117, the first of=
 five planned 2007 shuttle missions, March 15. But during a freak storm tha=
t thundered over pad 39A on Feb. 26, the shuttle's external tank was blaste=
d by hail, suffering thousands of pits and gouges in its foam insulation. W=
ind gusts reached 62 knots and hail up to 1.5 inches in diameter was found =
at the pad.

Most of the damage was restricted to the upper liquid oxygen section of Atl=
antis' tank. Only a handful of dings were found lower down on the hydrogen =
section and while two dozen heat shield tiles on the orbiter were scraped b=
y hail that worked its way behind weather protection panels, detailed inspe=
ctions show the ship's critical carbon composite wing leading edge panels a=
nd nose cap were undamaged.

John Honeycutt, deputy manager of the external tank project, said April 10 =
that some 2,664 areas of damage requiring repair had been identified. Two a=
reas, one near the tip of the tank that had between 1,000 and 1,600 hits an=
d the other lower down on the side of the oxygen tank with 200 or so tightl=
y packed impact sites, were so heavily pitted that engineers opted against =
individual repairs.

Instead, the damaged foam was sanded down so fresh insulation could be spra=
yed on by tank engineers. About 700 dings and pits were subject to repairs =
by boring them out and pouring in fresh foam.

Foam sprays normally are carried out robotically at Lockheed Martin's Micho=
ud Assembly Facility in New Orleans. The repair sprays will use a different=
 type of foam and it will be applied manually. These are "non-standard" rep=
airs and extensive testing was ordered to make sure the foam will provide t=
he proper pre-launch insulation and also stand up to the rigors of launch w=
ithout shedding any debris that could damage the shuttle's heat shield.

The first of those sprays could begin as early as Sunday. Other repair work=
 is continuing, including work to fix relatively minor collateral damage ca=
used in the process of making the other fixes.

Engineers also plan to begin removing Atlantis' three main engines Sunday f=
or main propulsion system inspections to look for signs of contamination fr=
om a silicon rubber material used between flights to look for signs of crac=
ks. A small amount of debris was found inside plumbing aboard the shuttle D=
iscovery, prompting concern about similar contamination in Atlantis and End=
eavour.

The silicon rubber is used before and after a shuttle flight to make exact =
three-dimensional impressions of the fuel line flow liners to look for sign=
s of potentially catastrophic cracks. Engineers apparently missed a small b=
it of the material after impressions were made in Discovery's flow liners b=
etween two of its most recent flights. NASA managers wanted to make sure no=
 similar contamination is present in the main propulsion systems of the oth=
er orbiters. So far, no other contamination has been found.
