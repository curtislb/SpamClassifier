You mean you don't want to display the video before taking the snapshot?
Seems odd; most digital cameras allow you to see what you're about to
take a picture of before you actually hit the button, otherwise you
don't know how to frame the shot.

In any case, the best thing to do is probably to ask on gstreamer
mailing lists, but you can ping Erik B. (glive.py author) and ask him
too perhaps.
