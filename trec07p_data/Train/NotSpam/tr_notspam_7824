[Please note that the worldHires database refers to a particular time
cross section, probably late 1980's. The territorial extents of the former
USSR in 1919, 1920, 1939, 1940, 1941, 1944, 1945, etc., etc. are not the
same;  the same consideration would apply to PRC's actual control over
Tibet. 

So to do this, you need a sequence of maps showing the marginal
increments, with 1917 actually only colouring Petrograd/St Petersburg and
perhaps some other cities. I'm not aware of any publically available
sequence of boundary files adequately representing the situation of say
the Baltic states or Finland for the 1917-2007 period, if anyone has a
suitable link, please say so.

Geographical data are vintaged, not just "where", but "where when". Was
for example Estonia occupied by the USSR 1940-1941, 1944-1991, or was it
part of the USSR for the purposes of this exercise? Using disputed 
boundaries implies a choice of point of view, one that may not be 
intended.]
