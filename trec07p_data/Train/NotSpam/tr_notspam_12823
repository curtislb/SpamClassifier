I am attempting to use gcrypt using a Perl interface
=20
I have "perl -MCPAN -e 'install Crypt::GCrypt'" and installed it successful=
ly.
=20
I attempted to run the code in Perldoc, but get this error
    Can't locate object method "new" via package "GCrypt::Cipher" (perhaps =
you forgot to load "GCrypt::Cipher"?) at gcrypt_testing.pl line 5.
=20
Any ideas?
=20
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
  use Crypt::GCrypt;
 =20
  $cipher =3D GCrypt::Cipher->new(
    type =3D> 'cipher',
    algorithm =3D> 'aes',=20
    mode =3D> 'cbc'
  );
  $cipher->start('encrypting');
 =20
  $cipher->setkey('my secret key');
 =20
  $cipher->setiv('my init vector');
 =20
  $ciphertext =3D $cipher->encrypt('plaintext');
  $ciphertext .=3D $cipher->finish;
 =20
  $plaintext  =3D $cipher->decrypt($ciphertext);
