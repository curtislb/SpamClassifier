Dear James,

on behalf of Debian-Edu (aka Skolelinux) which is a well established 
system running in over 450 schools all over the world, I can tell you 
there is quite a few things to do that
- make kids using free software at school happier
- could make your work and styles popular globally
- can make free software more attractive to decision makers.

There are two points to start with:
1. An individual desktop (KDE theme) with stylish widgets and icons that 
match the taste of teenagers.
So far we use the default KDE desktop theme plus some 'cool' wallpaper.
2. The web presentation has moved from a plone CMS to the debian wiki 
(http://www.skolelinux.org points to http://wiki.debian.org/DebianEdu). 
The result is rather pale - decision makers need a mocked up show case 
to get convinced. 

Debian-Edu/Skolelinux 3.0 "Terra" (based on Debian Etch) is to be 
released this year. So there is your chance to  become famous in no 
time ;)

I will send a copy (XPost) to debian-edu mailing list - please proceed 
there: debian-edu at lists.debian.org

With kind regards
Ralf
