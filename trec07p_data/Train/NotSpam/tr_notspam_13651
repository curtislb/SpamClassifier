Spotting a Possible Big Winner

Editors Note: On this beautiful Saturday (at least in Massachusetts),
I'm pleased once again to be "replaced" by Mike Cintolo, the editor of
Cabot Top Ten and co-editor of Cabot Market Letter.  Mike's our
leading student of the market, meaning he's the expert chart-reader
and market pulse-taker on the staff, and I know you'll enjoy what he
has to say.

As for me, I'll be back to you on Monday with the Memorial Day issue.
- Timothy Lutts.

Well, in the past two months I've taken an amazing trip to Orlando (stayed
at Portofino Bay, a great place to get engaged, or anything romantic, for
that matter) and another to California's wine country.  But due to those
excursions, I'm left with the following equation:

2007's vacation allowance - two trips in two months = Mike is typing like
a fiend the Friday before Memorial Day!  So I'm penning this Friday
afternoon, for your enjoyment on Saturday.  As always, give me a shout at
mike@cabotwealth.com with any questions or comments.

Without further ado, let me get right into it - let's discuss my market
outlook.

We're nearly five months through 2007, and the markets have served enough
twists and turns to give us all motion sickness.  There was a good, ol'
fashioned ramp up in the later part of January, the sickening Shanghai
Shakeout, and the spectacular two-month levitation act since late March. 


Of course, right before every one of those twists, most investors believed
the exact opposite would happen - investors were out-and-out bullish in
mid-February, for instance, and were also convinced China would drag down
the world economy in late March.  The market, remember, serves to fool the
majority, and it's certainly earning its keep this year.

But that's all history.  What's on the horizon?  I feel that another twist
is right around the corner ... in the near-term, anyway. 

I've written here before how bullish I am for the rest of the year, even
into 2008; some longer-term indicators (9:1 volume up days, record high
NYSE short interest, Presidential Election Cycle, etc.) tell us the
current bull move should be more powerful than those seen in recent years.
And that view is unchanged; looking out six to twelve months, I believe
the odds are in favor of the market being 10%, 15% or 20% higher.  So if
you're heavily invested in your 401(k), you should do just fine.

But for those of you who invest based on the intermediate-term like me, I
believe the market is nearing what I'm calling (with respects to Winston
Churchill) The End of the Beginning - the end of this tremendous blast-off
phase of the past two months, which itself is probably just the first
couple of innings of this bull move.  Translation:  The market's likely to
form a trading range for a few weeks or more before pushing meaningfully
higher.

I say this for a few reasons.  First, the market itself has become a bit
ragged of late; while the Dow exploded a few hundred points higher during
mid-May, the Nasdaq and the broad market struggled.  (Strike one.) 
Second, sentiment amongst the masses has become quite optimistic; we're
getting compliments left and right these days, a stark contrast to
February and March, when we could do no right.  (Strike two.)  And third,
very simply, most leading stocks have already broken out to the upside and
staged handsome moves ... something that usually precedes profit taking. 
(Strike three.)

Put it together, and I see no reason the Dow and S&P 500 can't carve out a
trading range for a while.  That's no reason to panic and sell everything;
in fact, the good news (especially if you're underinvested in top stocks)
is that any pause should serve as a new launching pad, offering you the
opportunity to buy top stocks as they pull back toward support.  (More on
that below.)

But, in the meantime, taking your foot off the accelerator a bit is
probably a good idea.  If you own a couple of laggards ... stocks you
bought a few weeks ago, but really haven't gone up much even during the
rally ... don't hesitate to sell out of them. You'll probably be able to
put that money to work in better stocks in the weeks to come.

So what stocks should you be eyeing if we do see some weakness?  Believe
it or not ... and this kills me, as I've always looked at cyclical stocks
with a frown ... oil stocks appear as if they have begun their next big
upmove.  Really, the larger, longer-term picture of the group as a whole
appears very bullish.  

Here's what I mean:  Sometime in late-2003, when investors had "learned"
for the past decade that energy and cyclical stocks were bad investments,
oil stocks took off.  You're probably familiar with the leaders -
Halliburton, Valero, Ultra Petroleum, Southwestern Energy and so on.  And
these stocks didn't stop going until the spring of last year ... many of
them up 500% or more from their original breakouts.  Sadly, I missed much
of that move - count me among the many that disregarded oil stocks back
then.

But I won't make the same mistake twice.

After a tedious decline and consolidation phase from early 2006 through
the first two weeks of 2007, oil stocks have entered into powerful new
uptrends, in effect continuing their "big picture" uptrend that started in
2003.  One of the stocks I'm spying:  Transocean Offshore (RIG), the
granddaddy of offshore, deepwater oil drillers.  Crude oil prices,
remember, aren't any higher today than they were 20 months ago.  But they
do remain elevated (above $60), and that means exploration firms are
drilling everywhere they can to find black gold.

That's good news for Transocean, both now and in the future.  Despite
having already seen their business mushroom the past couple of years,
management expects the current drilling cycle to last well into the next
decade.  And they're taking advantage of it!  The firm's backlog (due to
longer-term contracts for its rigs) stands at a monstrous $2.1 billion for
the remainder of 2007 ... $3.8 billion for 2008 ... $3.7 billion for 2009
... $2.7 billion for 2010 ... and $1.6 billion beyond that.  Imagine! 
This backlog allows tremendous predictability of earnings - analysts
estimate $8 per share this year and $11.60 in 2008.  All this for a stock
that trades south of 100.

Better yet, because the company's rolling in the spieh, it's buying back
its own stock hand over fist (it repurchased $400 million worth in the
fourth quarter) and is considering instituting a regular dividend, or
perhaps declaring a larger one-time payout.

Still, the real story here is the changing perception of the oil patch. 
It used to be that, if the price of oil slid, so would the group.  But
now, even as oil prices remain steady, oil stocks like RIG are being bid
up, as investors are coming to realize exploration and drilling activity
will stay hot for some time to come.  I think RIG is one of the leaders of
the oil patch; I'm looking to buy it on any weakness.

How to Invest Safer, Smarter and Better

Market timing gets little attention when the market is heading ever
higher, but now that a splash of cold water has hit investors in the
face, many are remembering that Wall Street is not a one-way street.

So if you're looking for a time-tested, award-winning system  as well
as coverage on our Two-Second and Volume Blast-Off Indicators --
consider giving the Cabot Market Letter a look. We not only tell you
the market's current condition, but we'll use that to get you in to
(and eventually out of) the market's best stocks via our concentrated
Model Portfolio.

You could easily see a $10,000 investment mushroom into $15,000 in six
months...into $20,000 in a year...into $35,000 in 18 months.

OK, so RIG (and oil stocks in general) is a good, longer-term idea.  But,
with a market capitalization north of $25 billion, Transocean isn't
exactly a nimble spring chicken.  You might be looking for a smaller, more
growth-y long-term story that you can pick up on the cheap should the
market give some ground.  

When looking for big ideas, I lean on three main criteria.  First, of
course, you want to see fast sales and earnings growth; I'm not a big fan
of buying unprofitable firms and hoping things will turn.  95% of all big
winners have big bottom-line growth before they make their upmoves.

Second, I want a firm that sells to a true mass market.  Medical firms are
nice, as are oil stocks or defense contractors.  But they sell to a rather
limited customer base.  Historically, most of our big winners of
yesteryear (Summit Technology, American Power Conversion, Home Depot, XM
Satellite Radio, Amazon.com, Qualcomm, etc.) have sold their wares to
literally hundreds of millions of potential customers.  A mass market is
always a plus.

Third, I'm looking for something new - new management, new product or
service, maybe even a whole new industry (like solar stocks).  That
newness usually builds a competitive advantage for the company, allowing
its growth to continue unimpeded.

One firm that meets all these criteria:  Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), a
relatively recent spin-off of McDonalds.  Maybe you've eaten at one ... I
haven't.  The firm has only recently made its way into Massachusetts, and
even that in a very limited way.  But it did make its way into Cabot Top
Ten Report a couple of weeks ago, and here's what we had to say about it:

"Chipotle opened its first restaurant in 1993, and today it operates over
600 stores in 26 states, offering high-quality casual food made from
fresh, raw ingredients. The menu is simple, burritos, tacos and burrito
bowls. But what makes the restaurant stand out is its commitment to "Food
with Integrity." Translated, that means food not only "from fresh
ingredients, but ingredients that are sustainably grown and naturally
raised with respect for the animals, the land, and the farmers who produce
the food." Clearly, consumers like the food; the chain saw revenues grow
26% in the first quarter while earnings soared 40%. More impressively, the
company opened 26 restaurants in the first quarter and says it plans to
open at least 120 in the whole year. What many diners don't know is that
Chipotle was bought by McDonalds in 1998 - a deal that allowed rapid
growth from 14 restaurants to 480 at the end of 2005 - and then it was
spun off from McDonalds in January 2006. Today it has no debt, a proven
expansion method, and good profit margins, all of which suggest that in
the long run, this chain could be a big winner."

The stock gapped up on its first quarter earnings report back on May 2,
and has inched higher since.  Actually, CMG has been hovering just north
of 90 in a very tight range, suggesting institutions are still
accumulating shares.  That's good.

Even better is the company's long-term outlook.  Ask yourself:  How many
stores could Chipotle open in the years ahead?  Hundreds?  Thousands? 
Management has certainly proven itself capable of growing the business
from $68 million in sales in 2000 to $823 million last year.  Earnings are
also swinging higher; from $0.19 to $0.53 to $1.28 to $1.71 per share the
past four years.  CMG has a legitimate shot to follow in the footsteps of
some of the big retail winners of years past, and I think you could buy a
little on any pullback, and then add shares on the way up.

Hope you have a terrific holiday weekend!
