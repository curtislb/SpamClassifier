<B>TONIGHT ON SHOWBIZ TONIGHT- CNN HEADLINE PRIME 11pm ET/ 11pm
Pt</B>

<B>PARIS HILTON OUT OF JAIL!</B>
Almost unbelievably, Paris Hilton has been released from jail
after just three days and ordered to spend the rest of her
sentence under house arrest in her mansion. Officals cite a
"medical condition" as the reason for her release but would not
say what it is. There is absolute outrage over her being let
out of jail and Showbiz Tonight has it covered like no other
entertainment news show. We are coast-to-coast with the latest
developments, the anger and the protests over the decision. So
be sure to watch a Showbiz Tonight special report featuring the
most opinionated and knowledgeable experts out there! It is
going to be a wild ride on TV's most provocative entertainment
news program, Showbiz Tonight!

<B>ROBIN GIVENS TELLS ALL!</B>
Mike Tyson's ex-wife, Robin Givens, tells her disturbing tale
of abuse! The former "Head of the Class" star opens up like
never before about surviving her devastating marriage,
including her painful claims that the boxer brutally beat and
even raped her!Robin Givens -- it's the emotional and revealing
interview you'll see only on Showbiz Tonight.
