No. This is a bug, and the border color can currently only be black or
transparent (but it's easy to find and fix the bug; lpolygon is very
short, so just write a replacement).

However, panel.superpose recognizes and splits certain graphical
parameters; border is not among them, but fill is. So you could do:

my.panel.bands <-
    function(x, y, upper, lower,
             fill, col,
             subscripts, ..., font, fontface)
{
    upper <- upper[subscripts]
    lower <- lower[subscripts]
    panel.polygon(c(x, rev(x)), c(upper, rev(lower)),
                  col = fill, border = FALSE,
                  ...)
}

xyplot(est ~ x | cond, group = grp, data = data, type = 'b',
       col = c("#0080ff", "#ff00ff"),
       fill = c("#bbddff", "#ffbbff"),
       upper = data$upper,
       lower = data$lower,
       panel = function(x, y, ...){
           panel.superpose(x, y, panel.groups = 'my.panel.bands', ...)
           panel.xyplot(x, y, ...)
       })

The concepts are all there in the help page (but it's often difficult
to put them together). The main points are:

(1) unrecognized arguments get passed on to the panel function as is
(2) subscripts give indices of x, y, etc in the original data frame

(the implication being that if you have another column from the
original data frame, such as upper and lower in your example, indexing
by subscripts will give you the matching subset). Other than that, the
panel functions have to do their own work (and what they do should
ideally be documented); nothing is enforced, so nothing is guaranteed.

This sort of thing doesn't get used often enough for examples to be
easily found. The following demo in lattice might be helpful.

file.show(system.file("demo/intervals.R", package = "lattice"))
