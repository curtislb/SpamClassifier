How can it be illegal to distribute?  Ebay User Agreements are not law
and Debian is not bound to it.  

The _use_ of the program might be a violation of the Ebay User
Agreement, but it's not clear to me that such a restriction is legal in
all juristictions, and I'm not even sure that the entire concept of a
click-through "User Agreement" is legal everywhere.  In any case, it's
the user who needs to decide whether or not he want to use it.

That being said, it would of course be nice if the program would make
clear to the user that Ebay doesn't like the program being used, in
order for the user to make an informed decision. (I have no idea if the
program is already doing that or not.)

Greetings,
Bas.
