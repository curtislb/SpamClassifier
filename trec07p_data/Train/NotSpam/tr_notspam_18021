Hi all,
 
The mirror has been running for the past month with a more redundant RAID configuration (on expense of storage area, of course :( ).
 
1. The IPv6 addresses will be either removed or utilized by the end of this week.
2. The non-US directories were synced from ftp://ftp.uk.debian.org/debian/, using the official anonftpsync script. Should I use another upstream server to sync from?

Yes  - definitely. It's already down.

Well, they'll have to change that ...

I'm also CCing Imri, as I know he can help with this.

OK. I get :

The following entries were submitted: Submission-Type: new

Site: mirror.isoc.org.il
Type: leaf
Archive-http: /pub/debian/
CDImage-http: /pub/debian-cd/

A proper project/trace directory was not found on the HTTP server.

The error message returned was: 404 Not Found

If you don't understand this error message, please contact us.

Entry not submitted!

Although http://mirror.isoc.org.il/pub/debian/project/trace/ is there.
And I tried to access it from gluck.d.o and it went fine. Could you check?
