Very good to hear.

That seems like a lot of work.  Not to detract from your good results
but I think that much effort was not needed.

The default installation of Etch will install NetworkManager by
default.  Internally NetworkManager already uses wpa_supplicant.
Therefore I think that if you use NM to connect that you will get
wpa_supplicant without needing to compile and install it explicitly.

It "just worked" for me when I connected up to a WPA wireless node.  I
have always been a low-level type of guy and only recently tried using
NM to manage these things.  But so far I am quite impressed, like it
quite a bit, and think the relationship with NM will be a long one.

Hear you Bob.&nbsp; I make the whole thing much toooo difficult by trying to
configure the later version of supplicant while the one in etch was
already installed.&nbsp; It was a matter of forging ahead without having
read enough about etch and knowing that supplicant was already there.&nbsp; <br>
