you said : "the observation times were the same for all subjects " can you give me any example where the observation time is different in VAR analysis?

Panel data is about several subjects being tracked over time, so gives a 
series of related time series.  It also known as 'longitudinal data' or 
'repeated measures' (perhaps with slightly different emphases).

If the observation times were the same for all subjects a vector AR 
(presumably the one of several senses of 'VAR' being used) could be used, 
but conventional analyses are via mixed/GEE models (and in simple cases 
these reduce to a nested anova).

There are examples in MASS and in Diggle, Hegarty, Liang and Zeger (cited 
there).
