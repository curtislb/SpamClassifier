This technique is tought in many statisticaltextbooks  popular among ecologists. The key problem here is: how do you *know*that the intercept is zero? Even in logically compelling cases it is very easyto reach false certainty of zero intercept. A typical case in ecology is wherepeople study  the number of species against biomass, and argue that there *must*be zero species when biomass = 0 (if there is nothing, then there is nothing).The conclusion is that you must fit a model with no intercept. Let's see atypical example (and I'm so confident that I won't put any random number seedfor this):
mass <- runif(100, 10, 500) # typical range for plant biomass/m^2spno <- rpois(100, 12) # Moderate number of species independent of masssummary(lm(spno ~ mass - 1)) # WRONG!summary(lm(spno ~ mass)) # More or less correct
It is not sufficient to know that the value must be zero in a certain point, youalso should know how that point is scaled: it may make sense to say that spno =0 at log(mass) = -Inf, but then it does not make sense to force regressionthrough that point. In particular, when the zero-point is extrapolated from thedata, it is dangerous to force regression through the origin. Further, if your xdoes not have a really natural scale, but you can replace x with x - constant(like x - mean(x)), then it hardly makes sense to play with zero intercepts.  
There may be cases where forcing regression through zero makes sense, but theyseem to be very rare. I've seen them very rarely.
There is an exegetic text on the issue athttp://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/MASS3/Exegeses.pdf which also touches this issue(page 3) and makes a nice reading anyhow.
Cheers, Jari Oksanen
