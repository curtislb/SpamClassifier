Yes, eureka!  That was it!  Thank you so much!!!  I've bashed my head 
against the wall, on and off, due to this problem.

My client is rarely rebooted.  It's pretty much rebooted on Patch 
Tuesday from Microsoft, or when I install something that requires a 
reboot.  Otherwise, it just runs.

I have several clients, and they were both ill after the Samba upgrade.  
I noted the following:

Client A is rebooted (shares not mounted).  Mount the shares, they just 
worked.

Client B, which has the shares mounted 24x7 (and mounted at the time of 
the reboot), is rebooted.  Upon reboot, it gave a pretty bizarre error 
when I tried to access one of the Samba shares.  Delete the share (net 
use l: /d), then remount it.  Now the share is fine.

So, the correct recovery case here is:

1) If the share is mounted, dismount it.
2) Reboot
3) Mount the shares, and you should be fine  If you forget #1 above, 
then I was fine deleting the share and remounting without a further reboot.

Again, thank you so much for your help, Jeremy!  I really appreciate it!
