USA for Innovation Ad Campaign Highlights Thailand's Theft of American
Assets
Over 35,000 letters sent to President Bush and U.S. Policymakers

USA for Innovation press release
April 25, 2007

Washington, DC - USA for Innovation today announced an advertising
campaign to highlight Thailand's new military regime and its recent
threats to seize patents owned by American companies. The advertisement,
a full-page ad in the Wall Street Journal, highlights a recent movement
by the new Thai military regime, which assumed power by coup last
September, to steal American medical innovations.

Additionally, supporters of USA for Innovation delivered over 35,00
letters to President Bush, Administration officials and Congressional
leadership urging the United States to "take retaliatory action in the
form of trade or economic sanctions or the removal of military aid."

Complete Text of the Advertisement

      Slouching Towards Burma: Thailand's Radical New Regime When
military dictators take over by coup, the people lose. Right now,
General Surayud Chulanont is steering Thailand the way of Burma.

      First, he lined military pockets with pay increases of $9 million
and new military spending of $1.1 billion.

      Then the opposition started disappearing. Human Rights Watch last
month released a report detailing 22 cases of targeted "disappearances"
by the Thai military in the southern provinces.

      Then the Ministry of Health threatened to kidnap American
tourists. The military-appointed representative at the World Health
Organization, Dr. Suwit Wibulpolprasert, proposed in January holding
Western tourists hostage to bargain for flu vaccines.

      Then coup leaders hastily imposed draconian measures on
foreign-owned companies . like capital controls, restrictions on
business advertising and surveillance of Americans working in Thailand.
And now they are stealing American assets for military benefit.

      The new military-appointed Minister of Health, Mongkol Na
Songkhla, has begun to override the patents on American medical
innovations to strengthen manufacturing for the military-controlled
Government Pharmaceutical Organization.

      The U.S. Patent and Trademark website claims that such theft costs
America $250 billion and 750,000 jobs per year.

      In a global economy American innovation is our comparative
advantage. A study by USA for Innovation estimates that U.S.
intellectual property today is worth between $5 trillion and $5.5
trillion, equivalent to about 45 percent of the U.S. GDP and greater
than the GDP of any other nation in the world.

      We urge President Bush and the Congress to Protect America's
Interest and the People of Thailand.
