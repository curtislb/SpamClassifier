02:15 p.m., 04/26/07, Update: Hawking set for zero G flight

Physicist Stephen Hawking, the wheelchair-bound theorist known for his insi=
ghts into the nature of gravity and black holes, said today he was thrilled=
 at the prospect of enjoying a few moments of weightlessness during an airp=
lane ride off Florida's East Coast.

Attended by a team of physicians, nurses and supporters, Hawking expected t=
o experience 20 to 25 seconds of weightlessness each time the Zero Gravity =
Corp.'s Boeing 727 jet crested the top of a parabolic arc. Passengers in su=
ch flights can enjoy a half-minute or so of weightlessness as they "fall" t=
oward Earth inside the plane's foam-padded interior.

At the bottom of the arc as the nose of the plane is pulled up, passengers =
are subjected to about 1.5 times the normal force of gravity. Hawking, who =
suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS - Lou Gehrigs Disease - =
will be closely monitored throughout the afternoon flight.

"Many people have asked me why I am taking this flight," the renowned physi=
cist told reporters earlier today at the Kennedy Space Center's Shuttle Lan=
ding Facility. "I am doing it for many reasons. First of all, I believe tha=
t life on Earth is at an ever increasing risk of being wiped out by a disas=
ter, such as sudden global warming, nuclear war, a genetically engineered v=
irus or other dangers.

"I think the human race has no future if it doesn't go into space. I theref=
ore want to encourage public interest in space," he said, speaking through =
a computer in his famously robotic "voice." "I have long wanted to go into =
space and the zero gravity flight is a first step toward space travel. I al=
so want to demonstrate to the public that everyone can participate in this =
type of weightless experience."

Peter Diamandidis, founder and CEO of Zero Gravity Corp., said the flight w=
as organized to benefit four charities - Easter Seals, the Starlight Starbr=
ight Children's Foundation, Augie's Quest and the X Prize Foundation. Eight=
 seats were auctioned off, raising some $150,000. Rides on the plane normal=
ly sell for $3,500 per passenger.

"We're really excited," Diamandis said. "The entire team is pumped and read=
y to go to fulfill his dream of being weightless."

To ensure's Hawking's safety, the physicist will be closely monitored by hi=
s personal team of physicians and nurses. During a test flight Wednesday us=
ing an eighth grade student as a stand in, the team perfected the way they =
will gently lower Hawking to the padded floor after each parabola to make s=
ure he remains comfortable during the half-minute or so when he will be sub=
jected to 1.5 times the normal force of gravity.

"We've done a tremendous amount to ensure safety on this flight," Diamandis=
 said. "We feel we have an excellent safety plan."

Diamandis said Hawking's doctors will assess blood pressure, oxygen levels =
and other factors after the first parabola to make sure it is safe to proce=
ed. Diamandis said he would be happy with a single parabola, prompting Hawk=
ing to interject a computer-synthesized "no!"

"As you can imagine, I am very excited," Hawking said earlier. "I have been=
 wheelchair bound for almost four decades and the chance to float free in z=
ero G will be wonderful."

Hawking is considered one of the world's leading authorities on quantum bla=
ck holes and big bang cosmology. Along with his scholarly achievements, Haw=
king is the author of the popular bestseller "A Brief History of Time."
