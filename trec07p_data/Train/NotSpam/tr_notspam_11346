Big Pharma Targets Korean Drugmakers

A group of multinational drug makers has filed patent-infringement
lawsuits against Korean pharmaceutical companies in an apparent bid
to keep the prices of their drug products at current levels.

Pfizer is suing nine Korean drugmakers, claiming they violated its
patents related to the production of its Detrusitol SR incontinence
med. The lawsuit came after the South Korean firms produced a similar
drug based on elements used in the Pfizer med and applied for pricing
with the South Korean Health Insurance Review Agency, which means
that those drugs will soon be put on sale in the Korean market.

"As far as we know, Pfizer filed a suit in mid-April; we only
recently received the documents," said a spokesman for Boryung, one
of the drugmakers involved in the legal action. "Pfizer does not have
the patents that it claims to possess and its allegation that we
violated its drug formula patents is groundless. We believe we can
win the suit without much trouble."

In response, Pfizer Korea admitted it does not have patents in the
Korean market for elements used in making its incontinence treatment
medicine. Lee Eun-jung, an official of Pfizer Korea, said: "We
possess a patent regarding how to help the medicine’s elements be
abosrbed at a certain pace. The suit is about that patent."

If Pfizer loses the suit, local pharmaceutical companies will be
allowed to produce the generic medicines in question, which will thus
result in a 20 percent fall in its incontinence treatment medicine
prices, in line with the Korean government’s efforts to offer drugs
at prices deemed appropriate under Korea’s nationalized health
insurance system.

Patent attorney Nam Hui-seop says the number of such lawsuits will
likely soar in the near future as South Korea and the US on April 2
reached a free trade agreement, under which the government’s pricing
and approval procedure for the sale of generic drugs would be
temporarily suspended for the duration of any patent lawsuit brought
against a domestic drug maker.
