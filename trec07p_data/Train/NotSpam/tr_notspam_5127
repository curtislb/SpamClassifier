    Hello all.  I have a question regarding reading in a criteria file, 
storing that criteria in memory and reading in user IDs from another 
file periodically, comparing attributes associated to that ID to the 
criteria i have stored, and placing those IDs which match into groups 
defined by the criteria.

It is an LDAP directory, so multivalued attributes are possible.

Basically what i have to do is

Read in Criteria, allowing for Regex compares (a value could be compared 
with something like \w{3}\d{1}\D or something similar) and multivalued 
attributes
store it in memory
read in a UID, look up that ID in the LDAP directory
compare the values of that user to my criteria and adjust their group 
memberships accordingly.
This would be run with Cron nightly (possibly more often if i can 
trigger a reload of criteria should they change)

I was thinking about using a hash of hash of hashes... 3 levels (or 
more) of hashes... anonymous...

is that possible with Perl?  is there a better way?


Thanks in advance!

Cheers


CK
