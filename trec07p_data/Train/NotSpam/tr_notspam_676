Ooops, you are right. But in addition to whether or not a standard, it
seemed (and still seems) that "MPI is the current/future stuff"
whereas PVM seemed more like a useful but aging approach. (I am aging
too, so maybe that ain't that good an argument :-).

Oh, but except for a few very simple things such as broadcasting data
or functions to all the slaves, or cleaning up, I never use Rmpi
directly. I always use papply, which is, really, a piece of cake.

I am just scratching the surface of this parallelism stuff, and I am
sticking to the simple "embarrasingly parallelizable" problems
(cross-validation, bootstrap, identical analysis on many samples,
etc). So going any deeper into MPI (individual sends, receives, etc)
was more trouble than it seemed worth. papply or, alternatively,
clusterApplyLB, are all I've (almost ever) needed/used.

I'll take that as a compliment :-).

Aha, I hadn't thought of #1, beings as I am much more concerned about
#2. (For #1, and to check results, I tend to run things under
controlled conditions, where if a worker shuts down, I'll bring it
back to life, and start again ---not elegant, but this happens rarely
enough that I don't worry too much).

Right now, I am dealing with #2 via additional external scripts that
check that LAM universes are up, examine log files for signs of
failures, modify lamb host definition files if needed, restart LAM
universes,  etc, and with checkpointing in the R code.  But I think it
is an ugly kludge (and a pain). I envy the Erlang guys.

As for failure in the master ... I'll take that as an act of god, so
no point in trying to defeat it via miracles :-). Actually, the
scripts above could be distributed (the checkpointing is done from the
master), so this is doable via a meta script that runs distributed.
I've just added that to the "to-do" list.


Best,
