Hmm, so it doesn't really want to do what it actually does then?

But if there is a non-Posix ACL, then whoever calls this probably has  
a reasonable expectation that the ACL actually does something.

I think that this should either explicitly look only at the mode bits  
or go through the SMB_VFS_GET_NT_ACL path. Do yo have a preference?

Not yet, though I guess it's possible that one day someone will call  
that code :) I was looking into ACL support and this looked weird.
