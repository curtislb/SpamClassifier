Mark H. Weaver explains why scummvm games should be in non-free in
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gnewsense-users/2007-05/msg00072.html
and Justin Baugh replied pointing to
http://packages.debian.org/stable/games/beneath-a-steel-sky

The troublesome clause in the copyright licence is probably
"3) You may not charge a fee for the game itself. This includes reselling the
 game as an individual item."

Does this get into debian because the above is a trivially-avoidable
restriction with a Hello World, or is this an unreported serious bug?
The licence problem was mentioned in its ITP Bug 203862, but there was
no solution before upload AFAICS.

flight-of-the-amazon-queen has a similar licence, Bug 240427.

Confused,
