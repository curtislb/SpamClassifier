Changes and additions:

   SR-41 (06/11/07): Shuttle mission extended two days; fourth spacewalk ad=
ded; blanket repair ordered
   SR-42 (06/11/07): Spacewalk ends
   SR-43 (06/12/07): Crew awake; solar array deploy on tap
   SR-44 (06/12/07): S4 solar array wings deployed

2:03 PM, 6/12/07, Update: S4 solar array wings deployed=20

Two new solar array wings attached to the international space station Monda=
y were slowly unfurled today, pulled from their storage boxes by self-assem=
bling masts. Carried out in stages, the 15-foot-wide wings extended like gi=
ant window blinds, stretching some 240 feet from tip to tip.

As the first array wing - S4-1A - deployed to its full length shortly befor=
e 12:30 p.m., the gold-colored blankets rippled and gently oscillated back =
and forth as folded slats separated and were pulled taut.

"And Houston, ISS, we see 100 percent deploy on 1A," astronaut Jim Reilly r=
adioed from the Destiny laboratory module.

Forty five moments later, the other wing of the new array - S4-3A - was dep=
loyed, first to 49 percent and then, after a half-hour pause, to 100 percen=
t. Again, there were no problems.

"Houston, ISS, we see a good deploy," Reilly confirmed when the second wing=
 unfurled.

The new arrays, the first to be mounted on the right side of the station's =
main power truss will provide an additional 14 kilowatts of electricity to =
the lab complex, joining the identical P4 arrays mounted on the left side o=
f the station.

A third set of arrays, known as P6, is mounted on top of the station at rig=
ht angles to the power truss. P6 provided electricity to the U.S. section o=
f the station during the initial stages of assembly and is in the process o=
f being retracted so it can be moved to the left end of the power truss lat=
er this year.

One of the P6 wings - P6-4B - was retracted during a shuttle visit last Dec=
ember. Work to retract the P6-2B wing, which extends to the right side of t=
he lab complex, will begin Wednesday. Based on problems retracting P6-4B, f=
light controllers have reserved time for possible spacewalk assists during =
EVAs Wednesday and Friday.

Today's deploy was carried out in stages to let the sun warm the blankets a=
nd thus prevent a phenomenon known as stiction.

During the deployment of the P6 arrays in 2000, engineers were surprised wh=
en several of the blanket panels emerged from the storage box stuck togethe=
r. When they jerked free, a tensioning cable jumped its guides and required=
 repairs on a subsequent spacewalk. For the second array's deployment, the =
crew let the sun warm up the array and deployed it in a so-called high-tens=
ion mode. That technique worked, and the array unfurled without incident.

The same technique was used last September for the P4 array wings and again=
 today for S4.

Each side of the main power truss features a solar alpha rotary joint, or S=
ARJ, designed to rotate the outboard arrays through 360 degrees to keep the=
m roughly face-on to the sun as the station circles the planet.

The new right-side SARJ in the S3 truss segment can't rotate until the astr=
onauts retract the remaining P6-2B array at least 19 mast bays to provide t=
he necessary clearance. In order to move P6 to the left end of the main pow=
er truss, the mast must be retracted all the way. Retraction begins early W=
ednesday.
