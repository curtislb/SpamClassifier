You're better off arguing that I've gotten senile or my tastes have 
changed. Do you really think that excellent hearing is a requirement for 
appreciating Ae, but not Kate Bush's other albums?

Really, my problem is that my tastes haven't matured all that much. I 
still like to listen to noisy kids playing punk rock for their teenage 
friends, or more sophisticated noise merchants, like ...And You Will 
Know Us By The Trail of Dead.

My problem with the album is that it lacks energy. There may be some 
passion there, but it's too quietly expressed (if at all) for my tastes. 
And, the subject matter doesn't always work for me. I'm not interest in 
Pi. Or washing machines. Maybe when I'm older....
