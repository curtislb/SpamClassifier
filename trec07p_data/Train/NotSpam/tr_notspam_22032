What I meant was, if PCs don't have serial ports then synths will be 
made for USB, and then its a software issue. They will not become 
obsolete because of USB, in fact USB is arguably much better. 
There is always someone wanting to make money. What bugs me is 
when they are greedy. The price of assistive tech in general is obscene.
