 Internet Allows the World to Vote on the New 7 Wonders of the World 

 Even if you know what are the Seven Wonders of the World, did you know that they are about to become the old 7 Wonders of the World (not to be confused with the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World)?  Or that there is a vote going on for the new 7 Wonder of the World, and that there is now an 8th World Wonder?  Like it or not it's true, but thanks to the Internet you can cast your vote for the new seven wonders of the world, and your vote for the 7 world wonders actually counts!  (The Pyramids of Giza now have honourary status, hence there now being eight wonders of world acclaim.)
