Luke,
could you please refresh me where Ubuntu/Debian automatically loads spessifyed modules? The other question is this. In edition to loading in my case, Speakup_sftsyn, how would I be sure that speechd-up and speech-dispatcher launched automatically? Otherwise I won't have speech on the Ubuntu server, should I choose to go with that. Let me know what you're suggestions are, please.
Regards, --Keith
