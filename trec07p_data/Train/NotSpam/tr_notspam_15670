It is one thing to require preservation of the Appropriate legal notices 
feature in existing interactive user interfaces.
It is entirely different to compel users to include such a feature in any 
newly created interactive interfaces. This is far worse than the equivalent 
clause in GPL v2. People WILL ignore this requirement, and assume it merely 
mandates preservation of the feature in existing interfaces. This is a 
*critical* problem with the license IMHO.

Further there is no exception for interactive user interfaces where it is 
*impossible* to
meet the definition of "displays 'Appropriate Legal Notices'". Cases like an 
audio-only
interactive interface could not possibly include "a convenient and 
prominently *visible* feature",
and might not be able to tell "the user [..] how to view a copy of this 
License". It might not be
possible to tell the user how to view the licence. Especially if the device 
has no means of visual output,
in which case there is no way to "view" the licence. The program could 
perhaps give instructions
on how to request to have the licence read to them, but that is not what is 
required.

Hmm... reasonable legal notice will at least include a copyright statement.
Some further guidence could be useful. Can a mandate to include an entire
licence (talking abiout one of the short licences, like BSD, Expat, etc. 
[obviously a modified version of the licence,
with a mandate to include the licence text in the Appropriate Legal
 Notice]) be considered a resonable notice? It almost seems reasonable,
but on the other hand it is somewhat long, which may be unreasonable, 
especially in certain
types of interactive interfaces.
