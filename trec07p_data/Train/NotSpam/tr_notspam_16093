I am in the middle of the preparations for merging the
net_conf / registry stuff I have been working on. 

The preliminary creation of reg_api and rewrite of 
rpc_server/srv_winreg_nt.c by Volker has not been merged
yet... Are there any objections to me starting the merge?

The only chance I see to accomplish this is to (more or 
less) copy srv_winreg_nt.c and pull other changes necessary
to get the system to build again.

Thanks - Michael
