Lou Dobbs Tonight
Friday, May 18, 2007

Tonight, did the Republicans sell out on the so-called
comprehensive immigration reform compromise reached yesterday?
Conservatives are feeling slighted after yesterday’s deal, and
one political commentator refers to it as a senseless giveaway.
We’ll have the latest reaction to this deal tonight.

How does the action at the local level on the immigration
crisis compare to the federal government’s planned action with
the immigration bill? We’ll bring you a report on the tougher
laws found at the local level and the weaker proposals from the
federal government.

And more on Mexican border violence: 15 drug cartel members are
dead after a massive shootout in the streets of Mexico. One
Mexican policeman charged with guarding the scene of the
shooting said, “Am I scared? The whole world is scared.” What
are Mexican authorities doing to clean up the violence that has
spilled over into the United States?

We’ll bring you a follow-up on the country of origin labeling
for food coming into the United States and to America’s dinner
tables. Are states continuing to do more than the Federal
Government on this important issue?

And Lou will be joined by three of the country's best political
analysts for a recap of the week’s top stories: Robert
Zimmerman, Democratic National Committeeman, Michael Goodwin,
Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for the New York Daily News
and James Taranto, editor of OpinionJournal.com.
