Ye (below) has a method to get a nearly unbiased estimate of R^2 from 
recursive partitioning.  In his examples the result was similar to using 
the formula for adjusted R^2 with regression degrees of freedom equal to 
about 3n/4.  You can also use something like 10-fold cross-validation 
repeated 20 times to get a fairly precise and unbiased estimate of R^2.
