you need to provide a list for the `control' argument of `nls',  i.e. you need
to use something like:

nls(other_arguments, control = nls.control(minFactor = 1/4096))

nls.control() only helps in so far, as that it always returns the complete list
of three components needed for the `control' argument of `nls'. you can equally
well use an explicit list instead.

check your model?
check your data?
change start values ("wrong" minimum)?
use another algorithm (cf. nls manpage)?

a final remark (off-topic?), concerning the response of m. maechler (but I
notice this attitude continously on the list): this is supposed to be a help
list, neither a boot camp nor a thought-police school, right?. 
concerning the question at hand, the one word response

`?nls'

would have been justifiable (it usually _is_ in the manpage), if not overly
helpful, probably. but the actual response is worded such that --
would it be directed at me -- I would judge it simply offensive: "get to your
senses" is not what one should be told, simply because ond did not grasp how to
use the `control' argument and/or because in the subject (contrary to the body) of
the mail 'has no influence' is used instead of `seems to have no influence'.

I really do think that if someone deems a certain question really stupid, it
would be wise simply to keep 'radio silence' (i.e. ignore it), which probably
is the best corrective anyway. the 'how dare you' responses are annoying, to
say the least.

for heavens sake...
