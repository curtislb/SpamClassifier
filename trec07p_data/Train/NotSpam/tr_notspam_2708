UPDATE – 18 April 2007

Canada’s legislation on compulsory licensing of pharmaceuticals for export



In 2004, Canada’s Parliament unanimously enacted legislation to implement
the WTO Decision of August 30, 2003 on compulsory licensing of
pharmaceuticals for export.  It was one of the first countries – of which
there have been but a handful – to do so.  To date, not a single pill has
been exported under Canada’s regime or that of any other country with
fundamentally similar regimes based on the same WTO Decision – and more than
3 years later, no country has yet notified the WTO that it intends to use
the August 30, 2003 decision to import generics manufactured under
compulsory licence.



As mandated by law, Canada is currently reviewing its legislative regime,
and within a few weeks, the government must table a report in Parliament
with its conclusions about the lack of action and, perhaps, some proposals
about amending the regime to improve it.  In addition, Parliamentary
hearings into the failure of the legislation to deliver on its humanitarian
pledge are underway this week.  Today, Stephen Lewis (former UN Special
Envoy on HIV/AIDS in Africa), and representatives of Canadian NGOs that have
been active on advocating for global treatment access – including the
Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network, Médecins Sans Frontières, Oxfam, and the
Interagency Coalition on AIDS and Development – will appear before the
Parliamentary committee.  (Those committee hearings will be webcast live as
of 3:30 p.m. Ottawa-time: to watch, go to www.aidslaw.ca
<http://www.aidslaw.ca/> .)



At the Committee hearings, and at a press conference shortly before, MSF
will highlight its experience of having tried to use the legislation to
obtain a novel generic combination of three existing patented
antiretrovirals for treating people living with HIV, and the Legal Network
will present a series of key legislative amendments that would considerably
streamline Canada’s regime for exporting generic medicines under compulsory
licence – and that would go beyond the cumbersome, failed mechanism of the
2003 WTO Decision by legislating instead a process that is simple and
straightforward for both developing countries and generic manufacturers to
use.  Such a streamlined regime would take advantage of other
“flexibilities” in the WTO’s patent rules in the TRIPS Agreement that exist,
and that have been expressly affirmed and reaffirmed by WTO Members in both
the 2001 Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health and again
in the 2003 WTO Decision itself as being available to WTO Members.



Below is an article from today’s Globe & Mail, Canada’s national newspaper,
that may be of interest.  The full text of the Legal Network’s submission to
the Parliamentary Committee, including the text of proposed legislative
amendments, will be available later today at www.aidslaw.ca
<http://www.aidslaw.ca/> .



Later this week, the Legal Network and the North-South Institute are
convening an international group of experts – including representatives of
developing countries, policy experts, treatment advocates, generic
manufacturers, and Canadian government representatives – to discuss, among
other measures needed to help improve access to generics, the barriers to
the use of Canada’s current legislative regime on compulsory licensing for
export, as well as various options for reform that are being proposed.
Those discussions should help inform possible changes to Canada’s regime.



Finally, a public forum in Ottawa this Thursday evening, April 19th, will
hear from representatives from Thailand, India, Canada and MSF’s Campaign
for Access to Essential Medicines about current developments related to
patents and treatment access.  The event is free and open to the public and
the media, and all parliamentarians have been invited to attend.  Additional
details below – and for more information, go to www.aidslaw.ca/events.

Red tape blocking medicine for Africa


Organizations seek amendments to allow production of generic versions for
export


GLORIA GALLOWAY

>From Wednesday's Globe and Mail

OTTAWA — Three years after Jean Chrétien said Canada would allow generic
drug makers to send copies of brand-name medicines to poor countries to
combat diseases such as AIDS and malaria, groups that follow the issue say
not a single pill has left Canada.

The roadblock, they say, is red tape and a powerful brand-name
pharmaceutical industry that opposes the generic reproductions.

But the groups argue that Canada's Access to Medicines Regime can be
rewritten to get the drugs moving.

The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network and Doctors Without Borders will ask the
Commons industry, science and technology committee today to change the law
to allow any pharmaceutical firm to produce generic versions of any drug
patented in Canada for export to any eligible developing country.

"We are giving them concrete amendments that they could enact, if they
wanted to, to simplify the legislation and increase the chances of it
working." Richard Elliott, the deputy director of the HIV/AIDS Legal
Network, said yesterday.

Shortly after Tony Clement took over the federal health portfolio last year,
he said he realized that Mr. Chrétien's so-called Pledge to Africa was not
being fulfilled. The minister attributed this to a lack of "take-up" by
developing countries, where AIDS claims nearly 8,000 lives a day.

But Mr. Elliott said the problem is not that simple.

"There were discussions when the legislation was first being drafted [by the
Liberal government] three years ago where we and a number of the other
[organizations] raised concerns about the complexity of the process," Mr.
Elliott said.

The industry committee is conducting a mandatory review of the drug regime
and must table a report in mid-May. "So now is the time to go back to the
drawing board and say this is too complicated," Mr. Elliott said.

Apotex, one of Canada's best-known generic drug manufacturers, has developed
a treatment for people with HIV that uses three patent-protected drugs: AZT,
3TC and Navirapin.

Canada's law requires that the brand-name manufacturers be consulted to see
whether they will let the generic company violate their patents by selling
it to developing countries. If they won't, Apotex must obtain what is known
as a "compulsory licence" that permits the sale of a specific quantity of
the drug to a specific country for two years.

That means that "before there is any guarantee of actually being able to get
that licence and therefore buy the product, the [developing] country
actually has to step forward and be identified," Mr. Elliott said.

"And we have seen over the last decade that, any time countries contemplate
using compulsory licensing to override patents to get cheaper medicines from
generic producers, there is a great deal of pressure brought to bear by the
big multinational pharmaceutical industry, which doesn't want to see this
happen, and by the U.S. government, which goes to bat for its pharmaceutical
industry."

Typically, he said, if a country says it wants to buy the generic drugs
using the compulsory licence, the United States will threaten to cut off
trade.

On the other hand, Mr. Elliott said, if a generic manufacturer is permitted
to sell any quantity of a drug to any number of countries for an unlimited
period, paying royalties to the brand-name company as is required, many of
the barriers would come down.

"Countries that want to do this will still have to stand up to the pressure
that they are under," he said. "But, at least with the process that we are
describing, you could have any number of countries getting together and
making a joint order for a large quantity of product from a generic
manufacturer. That would bring the price down because it is achieving
economies of scale and there would be a certain degree of safety in number."

The Other War on Drugs: Access to Medicines in Developing Countries



*	A court case by a multinational pharmaceutical company threatens to
undermine India’s role as the pharmacy of the developing world.



*	A company threatens to withhold medicines from registration in
Thailand to retaliate against government measures to produce lower-cost
drugs.



*	And in Canada, a law meant to permit exports of cheaper medicines to
developing countries approaches the third anniversary of its passage — but
not a single pill has yet been shipped.



As the federal government reviews Canada’s Access to Medicines Regime, and a
House of Commons committee holds hearings on what should be done to fix it,
health advocates from India, Thailand, Canada and Médecins Sans Frontières /
Doctors Without Borders will give updates from the front lines on the
struggle for access to affordable medicines for millions of people in
developing countries.

The Other War on Drugs: Access to Medicines in Developing Countries [L’autre
combat : l’accès aux médicaments dans les pays en développement]



Une affaire judiciaire intentée par une multinationale pharmaceutique risque
de compromettre le rôle de l’Inde en tant que pharmacie du monde en
développement.



Une société pharmaceutique menace de ne pas faire homologuer ses médicaments
en Thaïlande, pour protester contre les mesures de ce pays pour produire des
médicaments à moindre coût.



Au Canada, une loi autorisant l’exportation de médicaments plus abordables
vers des pays en développement aura bientôt trois ans — et aucun médicament
n’a encore été exporté.



À l’heure où le gouvernement canadien examine le Régime canadien d’accès aux
médicaments et où un comité de la Chambre des communes tient des audiences
sur les correctifs souhaitables, des militants pour la santé qui œuvrent en
Inde, en Thaïlande, au Canada et au sein de Médecins Sans Frontières feront
état de la situation aux premières lignes de la lutte pour l’accès à des
médicaments abordables pour des millions d’habitants de pays en
développement.



QUAND :        le jeudi 19 avril 2007
