"THAT'S THE WAY IT IS: CELEBRATING CRONKITE AT 90" FRIDAY, MAY 18TH (8-9pmE=
T/PT)=20

The world is a very different place than it was in the 1960s and '70s when =
one voice seemed to speak for all Americans and, in so doing, to bind the n=
ation together. That unique and iconic voice was, of course, Walter Cronkit=
e's. CBS News will celebrate the legendary newsman's singular life and care=
er in a CBS News primetime special, "THAT'S THE WAY IT IS - CELEBRATING CRO=
NKITE AT 90," to be broadcast Friday, May 18th (8:00-9:00 PM, ET/PT) on the=
 CBS Television Network.=20

SATURDAY ON 48 HOURS <http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/48hours/main3410.shtm=

Here's a note from Producer Miguel Sancho on Saturday's 48 Hours Mystery, B=
eyond the Boardwalk:=20

"This report is a heartbreaker. It chronicles the tragic descent of four be=
loved but troubled women onto the harsh streets of Atlantic City, and their=
 ultimate demise at the hands of a suspected serial killer. Like any good 4=
8 Hours Mystery episode, this program provides in-depth coverage of the cri=
me and the investigation: the case is a true whodunit, replete with intrigu=
ing clues and some very unusual suspects. But just as importantly, the repo=
rt explores the dynamics of the criminal underworld where the victims, and =
many young women like them, found themselves trapped in a vicious cycle of =
drug-abuse, prostitution, and violence.=20

>From a producer's perspective, covering this story was an intense and harro=
wing experience. Atlantic City is an awesome place -- in the very literal s=
ense of inspiring awe. To its great credit, Atlantic City does not pretend =
to be Disneyland - it is an unabashed adult entertainment environment. And =
it cannot be denied that the gaming industry has created tens of thousands =
of jobs, and streamed countless millions of tax revenues into the state. St=
ill, when you first arrive in town, the contrast between the hulking casino=
s and the squalor that surrounds them is a shock. Frankly the place can loo=
k like a collaboration of Bukowski and Bosch. Then, as you start to get a s=
ense of how the streets operate and who the players are - the not-so-hidden=
 economy of sin-seeking tourists, drug dealers, hustlers, and street-walker=
s - there's the thrill of gaining secret, specialized knowledge. Atlantic C=
ity is, truly, one of most fascinating places I have ever been, and for the=
 journalist and the junkie alike, the action of street life is an addiction=
 all its own. But after a while, as you become attached to people whose liv=
es are so sad and hopeless, reporting becomes an emotional ordeal. It is ha=
rd to wade through all the human wreckage of the city's dark side without a=
bsorbing some of the suffering one witnesses. After three days there, you w=
ant desperately to leave. Of course once you've left you can think only abo=
ut going back.=20

It may be easy for people to dismiss the murders as a story of four women w=
ho succumbed to their own bad judgment and worse luck. Others may see the k=
iller as a something of an allegorical figure, a human embodiment of the da=
nger and damage of drug addiction. But if there's one thing I hope the view=
ers remember, it is that these women, for all their problems, were very rea=
l human beings. They all had families and friends who loved them. They all =
had young children. And whatever bad choices they'd made, none of them dese=
rved this."=20

- Miguel Sancho=20

      case is a true whodunit, replete with intriguing clues and some very=

      unusual suspects. But just as importantly, the report explores the=20
      dynamics of the criminal underworld where the victims, and many young=

      women like them, found themselves trapped in a vicious cycle of=20
      drug-abuse, prostitution, and violence. <BR><BR>From a producer's=20
      perspective, covering this story was an intense and harrowing experie=

      Atlantic City is an awesome place -- in the very literal sense of=20
      inspiring awe. To its great credit, Atlantic City does not pretend to=
 be=20
      Disneyland - it is an unabashed adult entertainment environment. And =
it=20
      cannot be denied that the gaming industry has created tens of thousan=

      Still, when you first arrive in town, the contrast between the hulkin=
g=20
      casinos and the squalor that surrounds them is a shock. Frankly the p=
lace=20
      can look like a collaboration of Bukowski and Bosch. Then, as you sta=

      street-walkers - there's the thrill of gaining secret, specialized=20

have=20
      ever been, and for the journalist and the junkie alike, the action of=
=20
      street life is an addiction all its own. But after a while, as you be=

It=20
      may be easy for people to dismiss the murders as a story of four wome=
