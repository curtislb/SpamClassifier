I. Security Alert
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Because our readers are important to us, we constantly scour the
media and news outlets to keep you up to date on all issues of
potential concern.

Everyone knows the importance of securing his/her personal
and/or business information in today’s world.

Today it’s: spam, viruses, trojans, spyware, online fraud schemes,
phishing, pharming, worms, bots (malicious code that turns PC’s
and servers into remotely controlled zombies) zero-day exploits,
and more.

But, do you realize that cybercrime has accelerated from hackers
to organized crime? Some sources state that, for as little
as $1, critical personal information can be compromised, and,
based upon stories by those affected, it takes years, and, often
personal time and investment, sometimes including attorneys’
fees, to clear up.

Intrusions have the potential to advance into areas such as:
printers, instant messaging community Web sites like MySpace,
corporate networks, voting machines, passwords, mobile devices,
cell phones, blackberries, usb drives, thumb drives, flash drives,
discarded hard drives, and some of the newer photocopiers
that have data storage.

According to some sources, a laptop is stolen nearly every minute
in the USA, and few are ever recovered. Because of hacker hotspots,
mobile and at-home workers need to use caution when connecting
laptops at hotels, airports, libraries, and, when intermingling work
data with personal data on their at-home connections.

Assume nothing when it comes to security. Scan usb drives that
you may have received at trade shows; when discarding or having
your cell phone repaired, carefully follow all manufacturers’
instructions about data removal. While we don’t want you to become
paranoid, never let your guard down.

Update security software; be wary of sites visited; and, although it
may be tempting, never open emails from an unknown source.

Look over both shoulders, up, down, and all-around. The data
you save could be your own. Eternal vigilance has its rewards.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
III. Give Yourself A Sporting Chance With Soft Skills Training
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As an Information Technology, or, any business professional, you
have direct input into the success of the enterprise for which you
work, and, therefore, into your own future.

Did you know that:
1. Not all business is b-u-s-i-n-e-s-s. Many successful business-
men/women have become so through sports networking.
2. “Sports” and “Businesses” have many parallel “soft skills”.
These include: confidence, decision making, optimism, 
presentation expertise, teamwork orientation, leadership, stress
management, effective spoken/written communication, etiquette,
listening, ethics. Lessons learned on the playing field contribute
to business success, and vice versa.
3. A tremendous amount of “business” is conducted on the golf
course.  Golf, the favored sport of executives and high-income
professionals, provides the opportunity for social interaction and
networking, meeting with peers, superiors, and potential clients.
This is especially true on the 19th hole (the clubhouse bar), where
social skills (soft skills) are critical. Learning golf could help you
to advance in your career. The only thing you have to heed is the
warning “fore” (get out of the way before you get hit by the ball),
or you will experience very “hard skills”. Ouch!
4. Both men and women can learn lessons from sports that can
be applicable to their business success, and vice versa. You can
flourish in and savor the benefits derived from both activities
through enhancing your “Soft Skills” via additional training.

Today’s job market demands “soft skills”, in addition to technical
skills. This has become increasingly important in the IT arena,
which has grown into a service industry. It is no longer the land
of acronyms and jargon that may be meaningless to its “customers”.
To thrive in this new environment, more employers are
REQUIRING the demonstration of “Soft Skills”.

The faster you learn and practice these critical “soft skills”, the
sooner you are on your way to success, both professionally
and personally. You have the “sporting” advantage – take it.
