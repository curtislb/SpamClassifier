Only part that matters.  Has anyone developed with this
yet?  Does it come with library headers and is it a later
version than the ibm viavoice previously distributed.  That
version wouldn't link properly against newer libstdc++ and
had issues where it puked if a linked program forked.  Just
wondering if they've resolved these as otherwise it's a
hell of an engine.  Oh also, is the english UK voice
available?
