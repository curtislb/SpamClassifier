Leo,

In the discussion around RT #41291, I think I heard you say something about 
the code:

    CONTEXT(interp->ctx)->constants =
        PMC_sub(sub)->seg->const_table->constants;

(seen for example in Parrot_call_sub() in src/extend.c).  Do I remember 
correctly that you called this an optimization that could take place 
elsewhere?

In a similar case, I have an NCI sub I want to invoke from C.  My impression 
is that the structure of NCI subs is sufficiently different from Sub subs 
that this code doesn't do the right thing.

If I were to figure out where to move this initialization, how would I do so?
