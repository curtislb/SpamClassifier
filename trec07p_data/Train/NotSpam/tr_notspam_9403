    Antiquities Authority manhandled Leviticus scroll, says archaeologist
By Yair Sheleg <mailto:yairs@haaretz.co.il>

Professor Hanan Eshel, the archaeologist who two years ago uncovered 
scroll fragments of the Book of Leviticus, says the Israel Antiquities 
Authority, which now has the finds, has cut out large chunks of the 
scroll on the pretext that its dating needed to be examined.

This was not a necessary procedure, says Eshel, since "experts say it 
was possible to test the dating without an intrusive examination and in 
the worst case scenario by cutting a tiny, peripheral portion of the 
scroll."


Relying on internal sources in the Antiquities Authority, Eshel says 
"there had even been plans to cut letters from the scroll but the 
employees that were asked to do so refused."

Eshel ties the behavior of the Authority to a dispute that emerged 
between him and officials there and "their desire to prove that the 
scroll is a forgery."

Amir Ganor, director of the unit for the prevention of theft in the 
Antiquities Authority, said in response that "in order to carry out the 
examination we could not avoid making certain cuts in the scroll itself. 
This is acceptable in every examination of this sort. We cut only two 
small parts, one-half centimeter each, from the end of the scroll. At no 
stage was there any thought of cutting letters, only to scrape off some 
ink in order to examine it. The minute it became clear to us that we 
could not have unequivocal results from such an examination, we did not 
do it."

However, the photographs published here suggest the scroll cuts are 
significantly more extensive than what Ganor acknowledges and encompass 
nearly all the part of the scroll that has no writing on it.

Ganor said examinations of the scroll have undermined Eshel's claim that 
the finding is authentic.

"I can not give any details because the topic is part of an ongoing 
investigation of this matter, but the examinations show that different 
portions of the scroll were written in different periods, which is a 
blow to the claim that the scroll is homogeneous."

Eshel, on the other hand, is eager to offer more information on the 
subject. He says: "The information that I have is that the examination 
that was carried out at the Weizmann Institute did indeed show that the 
two portions that were sent for examination belong to different periods 
- one about 2,000 years ago, and the other about 1,200 years ago. On the 
other hand, another examination carried out at Oxford [University] 
attributed both to a period 2,000 years ago."

Eshel says the Weizmann test results were flawed because of "the use of 
cleaning and preservation materials. I am not an expert on such exams, 
but the experts told me that such treatment may certainly result in a 
flawed examination. In any case, the writing on both segments clearly 
belongs to the Second Temple period and definitely does not conform to 
the Mameluk period, which is what the Weizmann Institute examination 
points to. Moreover, during the search in the cave where we found the 
scroll, we uncovered other archaeological finds for the period of the 
Bar-Kokhba revolt, proving the dating."

By  france24.com

Some 80 Islamic works of art and contemporary pieces have disappeared 
from the reserves of the Institute of the Arab World. Its president 
Dominique Baudis confirmed that they had lodged a complaint for theft.
 
?39 works of art belonging to the permanent collections and 38 pieces 
belonging to the Islamic art collection have disappeared from the 
reserves of the Institute,? said Mr. Baudis, adding that the thefts were 
discovered last week during stocktaking. 
 
According to Mr. Baudis, contemporary engravings and prints and cloths, 
mosaics, aquarelles and vases from the Islamic art collection have been 
stolen.

      The case of the stolen statues: Bronze artwork returned, one man
      in jail

By BEN CRITES
bcrites@islandpacket.com <mailto:bcrites@islandpacket.com>
843-706-8138
Published Wednesday, May 9, 2007

At the end of a high-speed chase on Hilton Head Island in March, the 
driver that deputies were pursuing abandoned his vehicle and his passengers.

Those passengers weren't in any position to flee.

They were bronze statues created by renowned professional sculptor W. 
Stanley "Sandy" Proctor -- the same statues stolen from the Red Piano 
Art Gallery on Hilton Head earlier that night.

After a lengthy investigation, the Beaufort County Sheriff's Office says 
it can't prove Jonathan David Limbert stole the statues, valued at 
$60,000-$80,000, from the studio March 23.

Instead, deputies arrested Limbert, 25, of Bluffton, on a felony charge 
of receiving stolen goods. He turned himself in around 6:45 a.m. 
Saturday at the Beaufort County Detention Center.

The "goods" were the statues depicting two boys, a girl and a dog 
playing follow the leader, similar to those Proctor created for the 
Florida Governor's Mansion in 1998.

Limbert told investigators the statues were given to a friend to sell as 
scrap metal, according to sheriff's Capt. Toby McSwain. Limbert also 
said that friend was in the car with him at the time of the chase. 
Deputies have been unable to confirm that.

Here's how things unfolded:

At around 1 a.m. March 23, a Chevrolet Blazer that Limbert was thought 
to be driving sped past a deputy on William Hilton Parkway near Park 
Lane, according to McSwain.

The deputy made a U-turn and followed the SUV, which quickly pulled into 
the Hargray parking lot. The SUV then drove over shrubs, through a ditch 
and back onto the parkway.

The chase ended after the Blazer pulled into the back of Fresh Market 
Shoppes and the driver fled. At first, the deputy thought others might 
have been inside the SUV.

There were, sort of.

The silhouettes he saw likely were those of the stolen statues, McSwain 
said.

McSwain said Limbert's mother brought her son back to the site of the 
abandoned vehicle. A Bluffton police officer had told her deputies were 
looking for him.

The Sheriff's Office stowed the statues in a conference room at its 
Hilton Head office. The next day they got a call from Ben Whiteside, 
owner of Red Piano Art Gallery on Cordillo Parkway.

Someone had stolen the statues from outside the gallery.

Whiteside said the theft could not have been easy.

The roughly 200-pound statues were fastened to concrete slabs with 
4-inch thick steel bars. To free them, one would have to saw through the 
steel bars and lug the heavy art away, he said.

"It takes at least three guys and a hacksaw to move one of (the 
statues)," Whiteside said. "They had to be there for an hour at least. 
You can't do it quickly."

The statues were returned to the gallery the next day with about $3,000 
worth of damage. The art is in the process of being restored and will 
likely be displayed again, Whiteside said.

Limbert was being held at the Beaufort County jail Tuesday night, 
according to the jail's online log.

Red Piano is one of several private galleries who sell Proctor's work.

Among the many commissioned pieces he has created are a statue of 
Florida State University football coach Bobby Bowden, "Father Kelly" for 
Bishop England High School in Charleston and "The Sunday Paper" for the 
Tallahassee Democrat newspaper in Florida.

"(Proctor) was thrilled we got them right back," Whiteside said.

  Spanish museum said to be exhibiting stolen Egyptian antiquity


*MADRID, Spain:* A Barcelona museum of Egyptian artifacts on Wednesday 
denied charges that one of its statues may have been stolen from Egypt, 
a dispute that has prompted the Cairo government to dispatch experts to 
examine the piece as a possible step toward claiming it.

The limestone artwork ? a 43-centimeter-tall (17-inch) depiction of a 
princess named Nefert ? is on display at the Egypt Museum of Barcelona, 
which says it will return the piece if it turns out to have been stolen.

The charges come from a Spanish Egyptologist who used to work at the 
museum but left about two years ago, Ildefonso Falcones, the museum's 
lawyer, said in an interview from Barcelona.

When the archaeologist stopped working at the museum, she demanded 
payment of damages for alleged psychological abuse on the job. When the 
museum refused, she went to Egyptian authorities with her suspicions 
that the statuette was removed from Egypt illegally.

"She did it in revenge," said Falcones, who would not release her name 
and did not know the exact reason why she left the museum.

Falcones said the museum bought the statue legally from an art gallery 
in Switzerland about eight years ago. It was later brought to Spain, 
where it was declared to Spanish customs authorities.

Zahi Hawass, general secretary of the Superior Council of Antiquities of 
the Egyptian government, told The Associated Press in Cairo on Wednesday 
that he is sending a delegation of three experts to Barcelona next week 
to examine the statuette.

But he said the issue is whether the piece is authentic, not whether it 
was stolen, and that if it is real, Egypt will claim it.

Falcones insisted the statuette is real. "If not, why all the fuss?" he 
said, adding that the museum had not been contacted by the Egyptian 
authorities.

"At this point, we don't have any evidence of what the motives are 
behind these suspicions that it left Egypt illegally," said Falcones.

He said the museum has two signed documents from Barcelona judges 
affirming that all statues in the museum were acquired legally.

Falcones said that if it is shown the statuette left Egypt illegally 
before being purchased by the museum, the museum will give the piece 
back to the Egyptians.

Munch painting stolen by Nazis is returned to Mahler heir
 
Vienna (dpa) - Austria Wednesday returned Edvard Munch's "Summer Night 
at the Beach" to Marina Fistoulari-Mahler, granddaughter and sole heir 
of Alma Mahler, wife of Austrian composer Gustav Mahler.
 
After more than five decades of legal disputes a panel had ruled in 
November 2006 that the painting, on display at Vienna's Belvedere 
Gallery, was to be returned.

Fistoulari-Mahler, Claudia Schmid, Austria's minister in charge of art 
and culture and Belvedere director Agnes Husslein signed the restitution 
documents in the palace's main hall on Wednesday morning.

"I am deeply moved," Fistoulari-Mahler said when the painting was handed 
over. "I thank Austria for the courage to accept that the painting had 
to be returned."

Minister Schmid stressed her support for the decision, already made 
under the previous conservative government, and said she would continue 
to look into other cases.

"We will investigate all cases, where there is suspicion of illegal 
activities and want to help Nazi victims to get their rights."

In 1937 Alma Mahler-Werfel, by then married to writer Franz Werfel, 
agreed to loan the painting to the Belvedere Gallery for two years.

In March 1938, after Hitler's annexation of Austria, she was forced to 
flee the country with her Jewish husband.

Meanwhile the gallery attempted to buy the painting from her. She 
refused, but in 1940 Alma's step father, Nazi supporter Carl Moll, sold 
the painting to the Belvedere in the name of Alma's half-sister.

After the end of World War II in 1945, Alma demanded the painting's 
return, and in 1953 a commission ruled that her demands were justified.

Several Austrian authorities however challenged the ruling, and as late 
as 1999 a restitution panel rejected claims by the Mahler family.

Experts estimate the painting's worth to be between 8 and 10 million 
dollars.

In 2006 Austria returned five paintings by Gustav Klimt, also from the 
Belvedere, to the heirs of Adele Bloch-Bauer.

Lowry robbery couple tell of knife raid ordeal

Helen Carter
Thursday May 10, 2007
The Guardian

An art collector and his wife who were tied up at knifepoint and robbed 
of almost ?2m worth of Lowry paintings have spoken of the ordeal they 
endured, in front of their two-year-old daughter, at the hands of three 
masked robbers.

The raiders burst into Ivan and Louise Aird's home in Cheadle Hulme, 
Cheshire, early last Thursday morning, after Mrs Aird answered the front 
door to a man dressed as a postman. Three men threatened to kill their 
daughter Sabrina unless they handed over their collection of LS Lowry's 
works, including the artist's palette and paintbrushes.

Article continues
One of the stolen works, The Viaduct, worth ?700,000, once belonged to 
the actor Alec Guinness.

Mr Aird said yesterday: "These paintings were my own personal collection 
-they're something I've been collecting all my life. It was like a 
pension - something to pass on to my daughter. I think this was well 
planned. I am not interested in the money - I just want the pictures back."

He said the robbers would not be able to sell the pictures, because they 
were so famous. Lowry was a friend of his family and his father, an art 
dealer, used to buy Lowry's works.

Mr Aird said the family now felt very uncomfortable in their own home.

"The people who've done this need to be caught," he said. "They held a 
knife to a two-year-old girl. They shouldn't be out there on the streets."

Recupera China barco con porcelanas de hace 800 a?os

PEK?N, CHINA, MAYO 9, 2007 (EFE).- Equipos de arque?logos han terminado, 
tras 55 d?as de trabajo, las labores de recuperaci?n de un barco de la 
dinast?a Song del Sur (1127-1279), hundido cerca de las islas Spratly, 
al sur de China, mientras contin?an las de otro barco de la ?poca en ese 
mismo mar, inform? hoy la prensa estatal.

El "Huaguangjiao I", como han denominado los arque?logos al nav?o, ten?a 
20 metros de eslora, seis de manga, capacidad para transportar 60 
toneladas, y un?a los puertos chinos con los del sureste de Asia y la 
India, lo que los historiadores llamaron "la Ruta de la Seda mar?tima".

Se han recuperado del pecio m?s de 10.000 antig?edades, sobre todo 
porcelanas de color blanco y verde.

Entre ellas hay piezas fabricadas en los que tanto hace ocho siglos como 
ahora son considerados los mejores talleres de porcelana de China: los 
de la localidad de Jingdezhen, en la provincia suroriental china de Jiangxi.

Las piezas ya han sido mostradas en una exposici?n en la isla sure?a de 
Hainan, que fue inaugurada ayer por Zhang Wei, director del Centro 
Estatal de Investigaciones Submarinas del Museo Estatal de China.

Zhang explic? que el barco fue descubierto en los a?os 90 y que seg?n 
los expertos es el m?s antiguo nav?o chino hundido en alta mar que se 
conoce.

La zona donde se descubrieron los restos, el archipi?lago Spratly 
(llamado Xisha por los chinos) es disputada por todos los pa?ses ba?ados 
por el Mar de la China Meridional, incluyendo China, Vietnam, Filipinas, 
Malasia, Brunei e Indonesia.

Tambi?n en ese mar, aunque m?s cerca de las costas chinas, los 
arque?logos trabajan desde hace a?os en la recuperaci?n de uno de los 
barcos m?s preciados para los historiadores chinos, el "Nanhai I", 
hundido hace unos 800 a?os, con unas 70.000 reliquias hist?ricas en su 
interior.

Esta semana, los expertos chinos que trabajan en su recuperaci?n junto a 
colegas brit?nicos se?alaron que han empezado a izar el pecio.

Zhang indic? que el rescate del "Huaguangjiao I" todav?a ha sido m?s 
complicado que en el caso del "Nanhai I", por estar a mayor profundidad 
y en alta mar.

Las autoridades chinas de protecci?n del patrimonio hist?rico se 
quejaron el mes pasado de que "piratas" extranjeros, con avanzadas 
tecnolog?as, est?n peinando los lechos marinos de China para buscar 
barcos como ?stos, en busca de tesoros, actividad que Pek?n considera un 
robo. EFE

At the Bruce, the Art of Deception

BY MAUREEN MULLARKEY - Special to the Sun
May 10, 2007
URL: http://www.nysun.com/article/54196

Faking it is as old as the recorded history of art. The fifth-century 
B.C.E. sculptor Phidias is said to have signed the work of talented 
students. Young Michelangelo purportedly added a false patina to a 
statue sold to Cardinal Riario, an astute collector of antiquities, as a 
genuine antique.

Fast-forward to 1999, when 28 Georgia O'Keeffe watercolors were removed 
from the canon. The suite had previously sold for $5 million after 
reported endorsement by the O'Keeffe Foundation and the National Gallery 
of Art. In 2000, Sotheby's and Christie's were embarrassed to learn they 
each held the one and only "Vase de Fleurs" by Gauguin. And consider 
those legions of small, unsigned works still beckoning scholars whose 
enthusiasm outweighs their discernment. The sheer scale of falsity 
prompted Newsweek's celebrated quip that of the 2,500 paintings Corot 
made in his lifetime, 7,800 were in America.

The Bruce Museum's "Fakes and Forgeries: The Art of Deception," opening 
Saturday, surveys the history of deceit in Western art with uncommon 
candor and lively scholarship. It is a rousing tour through intrigue, 
misattributions, copying, and creative acts of identity theft. It covers 
sleights of hand from forged documents and false provenance to technical 
procedures used to fabricate historical works.

Treating sculpture, manuscripts, Gothic ivories, decorative arts, 
painting, prints, and photographs, this feast of malfeasance holds as 
much for scholars and collectors as for the general public. The show is 
authoritative, instructive ? and wicked fun. The earliest forged styles 
on view are Egyptian, Greek, and Assyrian, from which the show moves 
chronologically through historical periods to the modern era. The 
caliber and scope of counterfeits exhibited, most from prestigious 
collections, is startling.

 >From Piero to Pollock, brand names of every period are widely faked. 
But the forgery market also keeps pace with contemporary trends. Forgers 
are driven, like collectors, by high auction prices. Forgery extends 
even to artists such as Jean-Michel Basquiat, who are not traditional 
blue chips.

Hans van Meegeren's "Christ and His Disciples at Emmaus" (c.1936), 
painted in the style of Vermeer, is likely the most renowned forgery in 
the world. It is thrilling to have it here. Vermeer's output was so 
small that this "hitherto unknown painting," created a sensation when 
its discovery was announced in 1937 by art historian Abraham Bredius. 
Van Meegeren's saga, his disdain for the art market and his postwar 
trial for collaboration (selling a "Vermeer" to Hermann G?ring) is a 
modern legend. His canon of forgeries ? the works Vermeer should have 
painted ? is not yet settled. Suddenly, Cynthia Ozick's phrase "the 
implausibility of originality" takes on real meaning.

A quasi folk hero among forgers, Eric Hebborn (1934?96), sometime 
prot?g? of scholar and spy Anthony Blunt, is represented by a faux 
Mantegna drawing owned by the Morgan Library. He inscribed "Andrea 
Mantegna" on the sheet and manufactured a provenance that included 
ownership by Sir Joshua Reynolds.

A convincing still life in the manner of ?douard Manet was exhibited in 
the 1913 Armory Show as an example of his contribution to the 
development of modern art. A deft "Giacometti" painting of a seated nude 
is by the versatile John Myatt (b. 1945), who gave up illegal forgery 
for the legitimate kind. Although he still signs each forgery on the 
front with the artist's signature, the back is now inscribed "Genuine Fake."

What van Meegeren was to Dutch Masters, Br?gido Lara (b. 1940) is to 
pre-Columbian pottery, of which he claims to have created 40,000 
forgeries. He continues to sculpt in ancient styles but, chastened by 
arrest in 1974, now signs his work.

The Rospigliosi Cup from the Benjamin Altman collection, once attributed 
to Benvenuto Cellini, has been proven either a 19th-century copy or an 
outright fraud. Nevertheless, the Metropolitan Museum of Art still 
exhibits it, discreetly labeled, on grounds that it is beautiful.

Museums are reluctant to concede errors or embarrass donors. When large 
investments and reputations are on the line, open admission that someone 
has been misled risks suit for libel or product disparagement. Besides, 
if a museum is courting a certain collector to donate his C?zanne, 
should it bypass his dubious Cassatt being pressed on it for an upcoming 
exhibition?

More people are responsive to signatures ? trademarks ? and the cachet 
of possession than to art itself. Forgeries, then, will be with us 
forever. That is why this comprehensive, imaginative exhibition is 
compulsory for anyone who would understand the cultural politics and 
gamesmanship of authentication.

The issues involved have profound cultural implications that go beyond 
the monetary stakes to the credibility of experts and matters of public 
trust. Bruce director Peter Sutton summarizes the show's purpose: "[It] 
challenges museumgoers to ask fundamental questions about what 
constitutes authenticity and originality in a cynical and occasionally 
mendacious art world." Both the exhibition and its detailed catalog 
serve warning to the inexperienced and the credulous and invite extended 
discussion.

A scholar in his own right, Mr. Sutton contributed a major essay on 
connoisseurship to Robert Spencer's "The Expert Versus the Object" 
(2004), a book which cautioned that "truth in labeling does not always 
pertain to what changes hands in the present day art world." (A 
variation of that essay appears in the catalog.) Senior curator Nancy 
Hall-Duncan is frank: "In the late twentieth century, forgery, like art 
itself, became big business. . . . [and] the temptation to misrepresent 
art has become stronger and more lucrative."

Thoughtful viewers will come away more attentive to conflicts of 
interest among appraisers. The Art Dealers Association of America, for 
example, maintains a prominent appraisal service, contending that 
dealers are best equipped to establish value precisely because they make 
their living from the market. Viewers may have their own thoughts on 
whether this is a species of poacher-turned-gamekeeper.

With art the new bullion, the culture cannot afford to have its currency 
debased.

Hats off to the Bruce for a confident tutorial on why fakes matter.

Until September 9 (One Museum Drive, Greenwich, Conn., 203-869-6786).

Prized sculpture stolen from gallery
Published:  11 May, 2007

A TRUSTING Black Isle gallery owner is now reviewing security 
arrangements at her facility following the theft of a prized African 
sculpture.

The abstract piece of work, entitled Bathing Man, by Zimbabwean artist 
Remos Chiuware, was taken from the entrance of Tore Art Gallery.

At 20 inches tall and made from white opalite, it is one of a range of 
traditional pieces from Zimbabwe currently on sale at the gallery.

The missing sculpture was noticed on Sunday morning. Gallery proprietor 
Clare Blois said, "We were delighted to have found the work of these 
sculptors and went to a great deal of trouble to get the pieces here.

"It is very upsetting that somebody should have just helped themselves. 
The sculptures are quite heavy and designed to be displayed outside, but 
sadly we shall have to reconsider this. I had hoped that in this area 
they would be safe, but I guess I was just too trusting."

The stone sculpture was brought from Zimbabwe by Jon Eaton from 
Gloucestershire, who has also set up a safe workshop environment near 
Harare so that artists can continue to work in the strife-ridden 
country. As well as promoting the artists' work, Mr Eaton organises 
projects in Zimbabwe to provide running water to villages and schools.

The traditional stone sculptors use a variety of stone types and behind 
every piece is a human story. Every sculptor works on their creation by 
hand, with no power tools used at any stage in the process.

Staff at Tore Art Gallery, who would be very pleased to hear if anyone 
has noticed the sculpture anywhere, can be contacted on 01463 871444.

Police probing link between blaze, theft; Replica Indian village broken 
into the night before costly fire

Julie Rudd  /  OSPREY news network
Local News - Thursday, May 10, 2007 @ 07:00

Thieves broke into the Huron Ouendat Indian Village the night before the 
tourist attraction was engulfed in flames, leaving police to investigate 
a possible link.

"I think there's certainly a possibility that there's a connection 
between the two incidents," said Det. Sgt. Jim Rettinger of the Midland 
Police Service. "We can't rule that out, but we can't give that 
particular investigation a link yet."

Firefighters from Midland, Penetanguishene and Tiny Township were called 
to the scene after fire was reported Tuesday at about 8 p.
m. Police say it took several hours before the blaze was finally out.

According to Jamie Hunter, curator of the Huronia Museum, the fire 
appears to have started at the front of the replica village and worked 
its way back. Destroyed was one of the two longhouses, maintenance 
tools, exhibit materials and a classroom used for children's programming.

Hunter says the fire caused at least $250,000 damage.

"It's hard to say, but the loss of six buildings and its contents plus 
the palisades was a pretty severe setback," he said

This is not the first fire at the village. About two years ago, Hunter 
says youths set fire to the far side of the village during the day. But 
it was caught by staff before significant damage could be done.

The issue of more concern for the museum staff is its vulnerability to 
break-ins.

Hunter says the village has been broken into many times. The most recent 
of which took place Monday night.

"We did receive a report of a break-in into the foyer area of the indian 
village," Rettinger said. "Some artifacts were damaged, and a couple 
items were stolen."

The break-in was discovered by the museum staff Tuesday morning.

The Ontario Fire Marshal's office is investigating Tuesday's blaze.

NEWPORT NEWS -- The former chief archivist for the Mariners' Museum 
library is facing a civil suit filed by the museum claiming he stole -- 
and then sold -- archived items.

Lester Weber was fired Sept. 25 for "policy violations which include, in 
part, the theft of archival items from the Museum's collections for 
subsequent sale on the internet and eBay," according to a statement from 
Alan Diamonstein, chairman of the Mariners' Museum Board of Trustees.

Newport News Police Officer Harold Eley, a department spokesman, 
confirmed police are looking into allegations against Weber but declined 
to elaborate, citing the ongoing investigation.

Weber and his wife, Lori Childs, are named as defendants in a civil suit 
filed April 16 in Newport News Circuit Court. Diamonstein, reached late 
Wednesday, said the museum is seeking the return of stolen merchandise 
and money for merchandise that was sold.

"They were archival items that people had given?," Diamonstein said. 
"They weren't on display yet."

Lester Weber couldn't be reached for comment. His wife, who answered a 
phone call late Wednesday, said she couldn't talk about the case and 
hung up.

Warhol found in Aspen after 17 years

Authorities recover artist?s Ali painting from owner?s ex-wife

	

Joel Stonington
Vail, CO Colorado
May 10, 2007

ASPEN ?The journey of an Andy Warhol painting presumed stolen between 
1989 and 1990 ended last week when Aspen police and FBI art-theft 
investigators tracked it down.

The painting, a 3-by-4-foot depiction of heavyweight boxing icon 
Muhammad Ali, is valued at $100,000 to $120,000, according to records 
police released Wednesday.

The records, from Aspen detective Eric Ross, state that Alan Finkelstein 
of New York reported the painting stolen to New York police in 1990.

The grand larceny case went dry until local art dealer Christy Lee Pope 
listed the Warhol on www.artnet.com <http://www.artnet.com> on April 7, 
police records show.

Ross quickly enlisted the help of the FBI and its art theft unit. On 
April 16, Ross met with an FBI agent and looked through Pope?s house 
with permission of a property manager.

They did not find the painting in the house but later contacted her by 
phone. She told them that Jeff Liddington, the owner of the CTS 
limousine service in Aspen, had asked her to list the painting for some 
friends, documents state.

Shortly after Pope listed the painting, however, Liddington had called 
her and asked to take the painting off, she said, according to police 
documents.

On April 26, the FBI agent and Ross interviewed Liddington about the 
Warhol. Though Liddington originally told them he didn?t think the 
painting was stolen, he eventually admitted it might be the case and 
told them to go talk to the owner, Alan Finkelstein, records said.

According to the documents, Liddington said he was told the painting 
actually belonged to Finkelstein?s ex-wife, Janice (last name not in 
documents). He said he had not ever met Janice and that a friend had 
asked him to sell the painting for a commission of $6,000 on the sale.

However, he said he got suspicious that the painting might have been 
stolen when his friend, acting for the ex-wife, asked him to take the 
painting off the Internet.

The 17-year saga ended with a single phone call, documents state. 
Finkelstein got a call from his ex-wife on May 1 in which she said the 
painting was part of a divorce settlement, he disagreed and she said she 
would return the Warhol to him.

On May 2, Finkelstein?s son picked the painting up from Janice in order 
to bring it back to his father. At that point, Finkelstein dropped 
criminal charges and said he did not want to pursue any further 
investigation.

The case was closed the same day.

Artifacts pit American Indians against museums
But a new rule might help tribes recover their culturally significant 
objects.

Kevin Livelli | Columbia News Service
Posted May 10, 2007

It was a hot and arid day in Pecos, N.M., when the elders and leaders of 
the Jemez Pueblo tribe welcomed an outsider into the fold: archaeologist 
William Whatley.

Wearing colorful headbands, the old men sat down on the ground with 
Whatley. Then they began drawing images in the dust -- images of bones, 
masks and pottery that were missing or had been looted from the tribe. 
The elders implored Whatley to use his scientific knowledge to find the 
objects and help return them to the tribe. Not an easy task.

That was about 20 years ago. Now, for other tribes searching for lost or 
stolen items, the process may grow a lot easier.

In mid-March, the Department of the Interior's National NAGPRA program, 
which helps carry out the Native American Graves Protection and 
Repatriation Act, announced a regulation requiring museums, universities 
and federal agencies in possession of American Indian art and artifacts 
to provide new lists of their inventories and to share them with all 
federally recognized tribes within six months.

The rule, which took effect last month, marks the first time in a dozen 
years that museums and federal agencies have had to share with tribes 
what's in their collections. This process may uncover many items missing 
for years, and it may encourage tribes to start making repatriation 
claims to recover their artifacts.

Repatriation is frequently fraught with tension between museums and 
tribes. Curators and scholars have an interest in preserving items for 
their educational and research value. For the tribes, reclaiming their 
objects can have a spiritual and cultural significance. But for some, it 
can lead to big business. A reclaimed object can establish a tribe's 
right to land, which it might want to develop.

"This promises to have a big impact for many tribes, especially those 
recently recognized by the federal government," says Dr. Rayna Green, a 
Cherokee and the curator and director of the American Indian program at 
the Smithsonian Institution. "And it's not just about cultural heritage. 
It's about money and land and property. This is America, after all."

Yet even if the new rule helps tribes find many sacred objects, it won't 
necessarily help them overcome the many obstacles inherent in the 
repatriation process.

"Tribes and museums approach decisions about sacred objects carefully," 
says Dr. Timothy McKeown, the senior program coordinator at the NAGPRA 
office and the man responsible for overseeing the entire repatriation 
process. "Repatriation is not just something you can do overnight."

To begin with, tribes can struggle with issues of confidentiality when 
filing a claim. Many tribes, especially the Pueblo groups in the 
Southwest, have strict customs and rules about sharing tribal 
information with outsiders. Yet the law requires a tribe to reasonably 
establish its historical connection to a particular object.

The Pueblo Indians of San Eldefanso made a claim in the mid-1990s but 
backed away when a dispute over the claim led to litigation in federal 
court. They didn't want to have to testify and reveal tribal secrets.

Even putting together the claim can be a challenge. In many instances, a 
tribe's spoken language -- like that of the Jemez Pueblo -- isn't 
written down and can't be easily transferred into the legalese necessary 
to file a claim. And hiring lawyers costs money, something many smaller 
tribes lack.

When claims are readied for filing, McKeown says tribes sometimes argue 
among themselves and with neighboring tribes over who has the right to 
proceed with that claim, who should act as spokesman and who will be 
responsible for the objects once they return.

One such case now under review by McKeown's office involves funerary 
objects and human remains that were recently found in Chaco Canyon 
National Park in New Mexico. Representatives from Pueblo, Navajo and 
Hopi tribes have all made competing claims for the same objects.

The tribes' competing claims can stir feuds that go back hundreds of 
years. "It has to do with very old notions of clan and kinship and 
philosophical and religious ideas about death and the afterlife," Green 
says.

"The issue is important because what you and I call artifacts are in 
their worlds living tribal members with the same rights as people," 
Whatley says.

Once objects are returned to tribes, one serious issue frequently 
remains. Many items belonging to tribes in the Iroquois Six Nations and 
the Hopi Nation are perishable -- cornhusk masks or headdresses with 
feathers. When these items come into a museum's collection, they are 
often sprayed with arsenic or another pesticide for preservation.

But upon return, the masks and headdresses are often worn in ceremonies, 
endangering the lives of tribal members and leaving the museum 
potentially liable for any resulting injury or illness.

"That's something we in the museum world are trying to remedy," Green 
said. "We're looking now into alternative means of preservation, like 
flash freezing objects."

Though the path to repatriation may take many years, Whatley says the 
end result will be worth the trouble for tribes. During nine years, he 
has helped return thousands of objects to the Jemez Pueblo from museums 
around the country.

  CORNWALL-A series of tall, graceful statues have traveled a long way 
to make their debut at the Insiders/Outsiders Art Gallery in the new 
"All About Africa" exhibition, but soon they will return home.


The show, a celebration of African art and art inspired by "the dark 
continent," as it is sometimes called, prominently features nine Vigango 
burial totems that have recently been involved in a scandal.
The obelisk-shaped items are from the estate of art collectors and 
producer/screenwriters Lewis M. Allen and his wife, Jay Presson Allen. 
The two purchased the totems for just a few dollars each on the street 
in Kenya in the 1960s while living in Africa. It seems they did not know 
they were purchasing sacred burial totems that had been stolen from 
their rightful villages by those out to make a few dollars off the 
tourists.
The totems were displayed in the couple's Park Avenue apartment for 
decades. It was only when the daughter of the late couple, Brooke Allen, 
offered to show them in gallery owner Kelly Gingras' latest show that 
Mrs. Gingras began her research and realized the totems were ill-gotten.
"Last year I went to New York City and saw the totems and said I'd love 
to show them," she recalled. She brought them home in her car, went 
inside her Cornwall home and Googled "Vigango." The search returned more 
than 30 pages of sites asking for the return of the totems to the 
Mijikenda people of the Kenyan coast. It seems that hundreds of them 
have been stolen over the years.
The gallery owner recalled the moment she found out the states were 
ill-gotten property. "My heart just sunk. I went in and looked at them 
and thought, 'Some way or another you guys are going home." When she 
called Ms. Allen, the young woman was shocked at the totems' true origin 
and readily agreed to return the artifacts but implored the gallery 
owner to show them anyway and teach local children about them while the 
two women worked to return them to Kenya. Mrs. Gingras raced back over 
to where the statues were and shouted, "'You're going home.' They looked 
much happier from that moment," she said.
The two women and the estate manager, Peter Jung, set out to find 
someone who could facilitate the statues' safe return. They eventually 
reached Tanzanian Ambassador Charles Stith and Kenyan Ambassador Peter 
Nicholas Rateng'Oginga Ogego. These men, thrilled to be getting the 
totems back, agreed to let Mrs. Gingras display the artifacts through 
the end of June, when they will visit the area for a formal hand-over 
ceremony on a yet to be announced date.
The totems, which can fetch between $7,000 and $10,000 on the open 
market, have been robbed from graveyards for years. The chipped-wood 
carvings are long skinny figures, most with ornate faces and delicately 
patterned and carved robes. They are between four and six feet high and 
about six inches wide, and some tilt to the right or left from years of 
being exposed to the elements. The Vigango are erected for high-ranking 
members of a secret society, called the gohu. The height can be 
dependent on the status of the society member. Otherworldly, they look 
like they are in mourning.
It is considered bad luck to remove the statues from their homes in the 
Mijikenda graveyards, and the people of that region believe bad luck can 
befall both the offender and the family members.
It doesn't seem that the Allen family met this fate, however. In his 
storied career, Mr. Allen had writing or producing credits on the movies 
"Lord of the Flies" and "Fahrenheit 451" and on the Broadway productions 
of "Annie," "My One and Only" and "A Few Good Men." Mrs. Allen logged 
credits in the movie versions of Alfred Hitchcock's "Marnie," "The Prime 
of Miss Jean Brodie," "Cabaret," "Funny Lady" and the remake of "The 
Thomas Crown Affair."
Also in the show are more pieces from the Allen collection and from the 
collection of John Clayton, a documentarian for National Geographic and 
an admirer of 1960s art from the Congo. He will donate the proceeds from 
any sales to the Africare charity.
Cornwall photographic artist and entrepreneur (he co-owns Kent's 
Northern Exposure photography gallery) Lazlo Gyorsok was on hand to view 
the African art. He particularly enjoyed Mrs. Gingras' curatorial 
decision to hang a painting of a woman in a compromising position with 
the Marquis de Sade next to one depicting "The Last Supper" through the 
eyes of a 1960s African artist.
There are also works from five American artists that reference Africa: 
oils by Bernard Hoyes, found sculpture by Lucy Krupenye, watercolors by 
Joan Palmer, creatures and totems by Stewart Clayton and Michael 
Theise's bull elephant and modern trompe l'oeil paintings.
At the exhibit's opening last weekend, Mr. Theise's heavy pieces on 
masonite were being admired by Vance Jaffers, an actor of "One Life To 
Live" fame. The Brookfield-dwelling thespian is a longtime friend of the 
painting's owner, famed acting coach Phillip Tavonatti, and Mr. Jaffers 
was there on his behalf. If his painting sells, Mr. Tavonatti will 
donate the proceeds to African charity "School of Dreams."
Ms. Krupenye was on hand to discuss her found object, wall-hanging 
sculptures. The surprising discrepancy between her petite, blond, 
girlish appearance and the totemic sculptures she creates from found 
objects, including car parts such as catalytic converters and flattened 
tailpipes, and even deer bones she finds in the woods, is charming.
The Wilton-based sculptor's pieces have an African sensibility that is 
not entirely unlike the Vigango totems. "I grew up in a house surrounded 
by African art, my parents were collectors," she said of her frame of 
reference.
Her pieces, which all have a sort of warm, protective and motherly feel 
and shape, bear names such as "AuTotem," for one made of car parts, 
"Guardian" and "Le Reine Rouge," or "the red queen," for one made of 
rusted parts that have taken on a rusty red patina.
Ms. Krupenye was especially moved by the story of the Vigango. "When I 
first saw them, I was immediately drawn to them. They looked like 
something that could have been in the house I grew up in. When I heard 
the story my first thoughts were that the same thing could have happened 
to my parents without their realizing it. They bought art in the same 
way. It's extraordinary that they are going to be retuned," she said.
The more far-reaching message of the Vigango's journey will be delivered 
to younger people who visit the gallery with their school classes, Mrs. 
Gingras hopes. "If we hit young minds they'll absorb this story and in 
the future when they travel to Africa, or any area where artifacts are 
black marketed, they won't buy them, they'll think twice and do their 
homework," she said.
The gallery is at 131 Kent Rd. at the intersection of Routes 7 and 45. 
The show is up through June 24. Call 860-672-6631 for more information.

  Kunstraub in Rheinbach

*Diebe entwendeten zwei gro?formatige Gem?lde aus der Glasfachschule.*


Bislang unbekannte T?ter haben w?hrend einer Ausstellung im Rheinbacher 
Glaspavillon an der Glasfachschule zwei gro?formatige Gem?lde der K?lner 
K?nstlerin Dagmar Dost-Nolden entwendet. Wie die Polizei Bonn heute 
mitteilt, hat sich der Diebstahl zwischen dem vergangenen Sonntag, 
6.Mai, 20:00 Uhr, und dem gestrigen Mittwoch, 9. Mai, 08:00 Uhr, ereignet.

Die beiden Gem?lde mit dem Titel "Flucht aus dem Paradies" haben jeweils 
ein Format von 250 cm mal 145 cm. W?hrend der Ausstellung befanden sie 
sich in einer gl?sernen Vitrine. Nach dem bisherigen Ermittlungsstand 
stahlen die T?ter zun?chst die Schl?ssel f?r den Pavillon aus einem 
B?roraum der Glasfachschule. Damit ?ffneten sie die Vitrine und 
entwendeten die beiden Kunstwerke.

Die Polizei geht davon, dass vor allem der Abtransport der gro?fl?chigen 
Bilder aufgefallen sein k?nnte. Hinweise nehmen die Ermittler unter der 
Rufnummer 0228/156211 entgegen.
