Alas, Donny has no desire to be intellectually honest, as these very
points have been mentioned to him time and time again to no avail.  He
just likes to push people's buttons to get a rise out of them by reciting
Oxycontin-addled Rush Limabugh-isms.

You need fear not about this, though.  Despite being politically
reactionary, our Donny is quite enlightened on the matter of religion.
I.e., it's the Oxycontin of the masses.  After all, not everyone has the
disposible income, and Dr. Feelgood connections of Mr. Limbaugh.
