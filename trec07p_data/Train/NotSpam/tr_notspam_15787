Please _do_ read the message.  Only you are talking about 'doubled 
values': the error report is about 'zero or negative distance'

What the help page says is

        d: distance structure of the form returned by 'dist', or a full,
           symmetric matrix.  Data are assumed to be dissimilarities or
           relative distances, but must be positive except for
           self-distance.  Both missing and infinite values are allowed.

and you are not supplying such a structure.

In any case, you seem to be trying to do isoMDS on Euclidean distances 
from a 1D array.  There is no point in doing any form of MDS on Euclidean 
distances unless dimension reduction is involved, since otherwise the 
distances can be represented exactly.

I suggest you take some statistical advice on your problem, as your issues 
do not seem to be with R.
