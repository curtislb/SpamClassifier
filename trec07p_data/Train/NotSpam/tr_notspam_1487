I am not sure I see how the GFDL solves any perceived problem that BY- 
SA creates. The GFDL, like every copyleft license I know of, applies  
its obligation to license beyond the original work only if there is a  
"modification." It, more over, explicitly permits items to be mixed  
without the copyleft component being applied to the other works. A  
photographer concerned that the copyleft rules of the BY-SA don't  
obligate enough won't get additional obligations from the GFDL.

This is indeed why, e.g., Erik, is thinking about a clever  
modification to the BY-SA scope to apply the obligation beyond  
derivatives. But until such modifications are added, either to the CC  
licenses or the GFDL, copyleft licenses will raise this important  
issue for photographers, and other authors too.
