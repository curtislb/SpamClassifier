Ah - this explains a lot. The default for the "msdfs root"
parameter changed between 3.0.24 from True to False.

Has this client been restarted since the new Samba
load was added and restarted ?

If not - try rebooting the client. The clients remember
if a server was a dfs root and act accordingly until a
restart.

The decision was made to change "msdfs root = no"
due to problems detecting that the initial name given in
a dfs root path belonged to this server (as I recall).

Jeremy.
