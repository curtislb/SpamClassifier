Hi all:  I'm using grml, and have a question about x.  I downloaded the 
gnome desktop, and at the gdm beep I type in my username and password, 
and I can hear the desktop load by the noise of the hd, but after that, 
I don't have keyboard control.  I know grml ships with fluxbox, and 
didn't have keyboard control after logging in using that either... what 
do I do to get keyboard control so I can run something in x?  Sorry if 
this was the wrong place to post this...
Thanks much
Cheereo!
