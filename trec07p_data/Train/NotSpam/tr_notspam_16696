What ever works for you; personally I just edit /etc/asound.conf by hand and 
do an alsactl restore.
Different strokes for different folks.
With amixer and alsamixer you see the complete mixer on the card; aumix 
dumbs it down. If that allows you to unmute and change the controls easily 
with speech i'd suggest not using amixer but leaving it installed it is 
handy in scripts.
Regards, Kerry.
