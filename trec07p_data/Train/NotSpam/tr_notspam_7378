Thanks, Duncan. I'll look into that. Is there an authoritative document
that codifies the new package development procedures for 2.5.0
(windows-specific), or is that Writing R Extensions? In this thread
alone I've received multiple emails pointing to multiple web sites with
instructions for windows. Inasmuch as its appreciated, I'm a bit
confused as to which I should consider authoritative.

I do hope I can resolve this and appreciate the help I've received.
However, I feel a bit compelled to note how very difficult this process
is. 

Harold
