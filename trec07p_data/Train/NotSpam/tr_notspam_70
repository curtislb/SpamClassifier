An anonymous reader writes "Announced on the Gaim mailing lists earlier
today, [0]the Gaim project is being renamed. This follows a lengthy and,
unfortunately, secret legal process with AOL, which also prevented any
code releases except betas. The project will now be known as [1]Pidgin IM.
Development is being migrated off of sourceforge.net as well and is now
being hosted on [2]developer.pidgin.im"

An anonymous reader alerts us to work out of Purdue University in
Indiana, where researchers have produced a design for a method of
[0]cloaking objects of any shape and size at a single wavelength of
visible light. The math for such an invisibility effect was worked out
last year at Duke and in the UK, but the new work, to be published in
Nature Photonics this month, is the first practical design. The lead
researcher, Vladimir Shalaev, notes that even though the current design
works only at a single wavelength, and so would not convey true
invisibility, it could still be useful — against, for example,
night-vision goggles or laser target designators. Shalaev calls the
technical challenge of producing an all-wavelengths cloak "doable in
principle."

both an update to Debian Sarge (3.1r6, henceforth to be oldstable) and a
new stable release (Debian 4.0, which was codenamed Etch) — and announce
the results of the election for Debian Project Leader — all within 12
hours. Sarge was updated late on April 7th UTC, Sam Hocevar was announced
as DPL at about 00:30 UTC, and preparations for the release of Debian
Etch are ongoing and look good for later on the 8th."

[0]Roland Piquepaille writes to let us know about research into producing
[1]palpable maps for the blind. Scientific American has the story of
Greek researchers who produce 3D "haptic" maps that "use force fields to
represent walls and roads so the visually impaired can better understand
the layout of buildings and cities." Two separate systems produce haptic
output from standard video and from 2D maps. The systems have been tested
on a small number of users. Currently the devices that interpret the
"force fields" for sight-impaired users are not portable, and so the
systems are most appropriate for doing research before, e.g., visiting a
new city.

[0]Xenographic writes "Remember all the fuss about SCO subpoenaing PJ of
Groklaw, where they allege that she's funded by IBM because she once got
a publicly available document from a volunteer at the courthouse a little
before it hit the Court's website? That's nothing. Groklaw has evidence
that [1]other materials have been leaked in this case — but they weren't
leaked to Groklaw, and they weren't leaked by IBM. Information about the
sealed materials in question made its way to Maureen O'Gara, who wrote a
story based on inside information, displaying a positively uncanny
insight into what SCO was planning, including far more than just the
sealed document a SCO lawyer read out loud in open court. Interestingly,
several witnesses report that Maureen O'Gara did not even attend that
hearing, leaving us to speculate about her source."

seconds, and tops out at 175 mph. Of course, there are few creature
comforts inside, but that's mainly because the car's 200 mile range is
meant for the track, not the road. Nonetheless, Popular Mechanics takes
the car for a spin up 10th Avenue in NYC. Oh, and the car recharges via a
110 outlet. They also [2]test-drove Ford's HySeries Edge, a hydrogen
fuel-cell powered, plug-in series hybrid that, unlike the L1X-75, is
unfortunately at least 10 years away from production and nearly 100 mph
slower."

error involving the name of a celebrity, were noted on a Google Labs

motion for legal fees. Unfortunately, her two children are still 'in the
