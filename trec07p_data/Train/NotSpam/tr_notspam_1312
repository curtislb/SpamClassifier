Re: Thinkpad Saga Continues
Hi Sean and all,

That's a really good question!<smile>  Yes, Fedora did notice my 
Windows  partition.  The problem was that the way that Lenovo made the  
partitions, according
to my Linux instructor, meant that we had to break  the existing 
partitions before installing Linux and then fix grub to  recognize what 
we had done.
The computer was broken into one 30  gigabyte partition and another 90 
GB partition.  Since there wasn't  enough room on the smaller partition, 
we had
to use the bigger one in  order to put Linux on one 45 GB partition and 
Windows on the other 45 GB  partion we then made. this meant that we had 
to temporarily
remove  Windows to build the new partitions.  Then when I tried to run 
the XP installer, either the newer hardware on the Thinkpad wasn't 
recognized, and also, Windows wouldn't even recognize that I had a Linux 
partition at all.  I really don't know why we  couldn't find another way 
to do this other than using a utility to  re-partition
the disk before installing. I'm not knowledgeable enough to  know if we 
could have done it better.<smile> but my instructor said we  had to 
breakt the
big partition in half so that Windows had half and  Linux had half.  
That part confused me a little because I didn't  understand why he 
couldn't break
up the partition right there and then,  and save my Windows 
installation,but he said no, so we started by  breaking up the big 
partition with the Fedora
installer and then  reinstalling Windows.  Here is where things got 
weird and now we're  rebuilding the system.  If nothing else, it's a 
learning experience.<smile>


Beth
