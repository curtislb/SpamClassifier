mmmn,if I was you I would write,

 $hash{$_} =1 for (@ip_skip);
 while(<FILE>) {
    my ($time, $lport, $ip, $stats, $rport) = split;
    next if exists $hash{$ip};
    # using those values above to create hash
    #based on what form of hash you needed.
 }

Don't think Label is useful in this time.
