Yes.  Like you said initially - a regexp quantifier will match as much
as possible WITHOUT PREVENING THE MATCH FROM SUCEEDING.  If the .*i
matched all the way up until the very last i, then the .*pi would fail
because there'd be nothing left to match.

FWIW, you can add:
use re 'debug';
to the top of your script to see exactly what Perl does when trying to
match a regexp.  You'll see in this case that it first tries to
let .*i match all the way to the end, but then finds that .*pi now
fails, so it backtracks, letting the .* part of .*i match less and
less until .*pi can also match.
