Heh. Now there's a compressible phrase. :)

("meshes" does not mean "matches" or "includes". When I joined we were
more permissive than both the BSD and GNU camps (GNU complained about
the BSD license, BSD complained about the GPL, we didn't mind either),
but we've never done that blindly, as the KDE, Affero or GFDL stuff
should attest. I don't see why you'd expect us to start now)

I don't think you'd have to look very hard to find people who consider
debian-legal's intepretations of various things to be irrational and
contrary to the long-term interests of Free Software.

Unfortunately trying to have a discussion between those viewpoints to
resolve (or at least clarify) the differences isn't often successful. I've
already listed some of the ways I think -legal regulars could change that
situation, if they're interested. But I guess ultimately, along with
James, Ryan, Joerg and Jeroen, I'm one of fairly few people who really
don't have much cause for concern whether -legal becomes a really useful
discussion area or not.

Cheers,
aj
