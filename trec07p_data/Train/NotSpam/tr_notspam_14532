While this hasn't improved as much as I would have liked, I'm hoping to
do a TP5 release very soon regardless.  I've got the LDAP backend
documentation in hand, and will start work on cutting TP5 as soon as
possible after that.

I think we have a lot to be proud of in this release, even if the CTDB
work doesn't make it this time. =20

I think we are well on our we to an alpha release.=20
