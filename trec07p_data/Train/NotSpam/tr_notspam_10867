Something is messed up with your locale or environment. Since you only 
have one character in $str, the length should be "1"--and that's what I get.

I saved your program two ways: as a utf8 file and as a big5 file; both 
programs produce the same result on my system: 1; however, to get your 
program to run, I had to change the quotes.

Here is the first program (saved in UTF8):
-----------------------------------
#!/usr/bin/perl
use utf8;
use strict;
use warnings;

my $str="我";

my $str_len = length($str);

print $str_len, "\n\n";
----------------------------------

Here is the second program (saved in Big5):
--------------------------------------------
#!/usr/bin/perl
use encoding big5 => STDOUT => 'utf8';
use strict;
use warnings;

my $str="§Ú";

my $str_len = length($str);

print $str_len, "\n\n";
print "data = $str\n";
--------------------------------------------

The second program displays this:
------start output-------
1

data = 我
-------end output--------

Evidently the Big5 character sequence \xA7\xDA represents the single 
Unicode character \x6211 which is the Chinese character 我. You probably 
just need to tell Perl about the encoding of your script.

My environment:
Perl 5.8.4
Debian 3.1
Encoding: UTF8
