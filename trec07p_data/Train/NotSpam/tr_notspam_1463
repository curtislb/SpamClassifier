Hi, 
I have sort of a newbie question. I've seriously put a lot of effort into how to handle simple replicates in a repeated ANOVA design, but haven't had much luck. 
I really liked reading "Notes on the use of R for psychology experiments and questionnaires", by Jonathan Baron and Yuelin Li ( http://www.psych.upenn.edu/~baron/rpsych/rpsych.html ) but still didn't run across an example using simple replicates.
So, I made up the data below semi-borrowing the idea of a reaction time experiment involving noise from Maxwell, S. E. & Delaney, H. D. (1990) Designing Experiments and Analyzing Data: A model comparison perspective. Pacific Grove, CA: Brooks/Cole., which was referenced in the Baron and Li link above.

The experimental concept I'm trying to envision is 2 groups of subjects (Treat and Control), 3 subjects in each.  In one session, all 6 patients from both groups are tested for reaction time by making 3 replicate tests on some hypothetical RT test (I call this the "pre" testing phase below or one could call this baseline ).  In a second session (the "post" phase), the subjects in the "Treat" Group are subjected to noise (or any treatment), while the other 3 "Control" subjects are not, (i.e. the Control subjects are basically tested exactly like they were in the "pre" testing session).

I'm trying to set up the correct model for this experimental design to simply understand whether "noise" (or treatment) has an effect on reaction time.  Can someone tell this newbie the proper name of this experimental design?

By setting up the design this way, I'm hoping one could see if there was a "pre" session to "post" session effect (using the Control group) and then take into account any possible pre->post effect when deciding whether there was a Treatment (noise) effect.  

Unfortunately, whenever, I put the Group factor in the Error term (to take into account subj:Group as a random effect), I get a singular result: (see the data entry section below)

        > rt.aov <- aov(rt ~ Group*prepost + Error(subj/(prepost*Group)), data=rt.df)
        Warning message:
        Error() model is singular in: aov(rt ~ Group * prepost + Error(subj/(prepost * Group)), data = rt.df) 

plus, I'm not sure how to include the replicate factor ("rep") in my Error() term -- should it be something like 
...+Error(subj*rep/(Group*prepost))?            
(this still gives the above error if Group is in the error term, but I'm pretty sure it should be there since all interactions given the individual subject are random effects, aren't they?)
In my hypothetical experiment, I'm assuming the replicates are independent samples of reaction time -- although, admittedly, there could be a trend that should be looked for if one assumes that the subject "gets better" with each replicate.

Suggestions on aov() model welcome!
Thanks,
Michael
