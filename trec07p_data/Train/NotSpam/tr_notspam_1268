TONIGHT ON  <http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/eveningnews/main3420.shtml> TH=
E CBS EVENING NEWS


Here is an early preview of what we are planning for tonight's CBS EVENING =
NEWS from Anchor and Managing Editor, Katie Couric...=20

Hi everyone,=20

Tonight we'll begin our broadcast with the news that embattled radio host D=
on Imus has been fired from CBS. The announcement came late this afternoon =
from CBS President and Chief Executive Officer, Leslie Moonves. We'll have =
extensive coverage of this story, beginning with Nancy Cordes with all the =
late breaking details of the decision. Then we'll turn to CBS News' Jeff Gr=
eenfield and Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson for analysis.=20

Also tonight, we'll have the story of a deadly attack directed at the Iraqi=
 government. A suicide bomb exploded inside what is supposed to be the most=
 protected area of Baghdad - the heavily fortified Green Zone. A bomber ble=
w himself up in the cafeteria of the Iraqi parliament, killing at least eig=
ht people, including several lawmakers. Martin Seemungal will have the stor=
y.=20

Today in Afghanistan, U.S.-led forces bombed weapon-filled caves killing an=
 estimated 35 militants. The strikes happened as the war in Afghanistan is =
reaching a critical point: The Taliban are expected to launch a spring offe=
nsive. Chief Foreign Correspondent Lara Logan reports from the frontlines o=
n how NATO plans to strike first.=20

Another career hanging in the balance is that of Durham County district att=
orney Mike Nifong. Yesterday's announcement that charges against the Duke l=
acrosse players were dropped also brought increased scrutiny against Nifong=
, whose investigation into the sexual assault accusation was called a "trag=
ic rush to accuse." Kelly Wallace will have an update.=20

And finally, a legend in American writing died today. Known for countercult=
ural novels such as Cat's Cradle and Slaughterhouse-Five, Kurt Vonnegut was=
 a legendary social critic who also wrote dozens of short stories, essays a=
nd plays. Richard Schlesinger will take a look at the life of this writer a=
nd his influence on 20th Century literature.=20

I hope you'll join us.=20

CHEWING THE FAT: TRANSFATS: Friday morning, we'll take a look at the import=
ance of keeping track of the harmful fats in our diets. Lately, the trans f=
ats in many foods we eat have gotten a lot of attention as being especially=

SATURDAY ON  <http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/48hours/main3410.shtml> 48 HO=
URS

Here's a note from Troy Roberts on Saturday's 48 Hours Mystery, THE PUPPET =
MASTER:=20

"It was an attack so brazen that people in Boca Raton, Florida still talk a=
bout it ten years after the fact. In October 1997, 31-year-old Heather Gros=
sman and her husband, John, were fired on in their car at an intersection i=
n broad daylight. It was clearly an attempted execution of a wealthy and so=
cially prominent couple. The bullet that struck John only grazed him, but a=
nother bullet severed Heather' spinal cord, leaving her a quadriplegic. Tod=
ay, she is still confined to a wheelchair. And there is no chance of rehabi=
litation. Of course, the question on everyone's mind was who would want to =
kill this attractive mother of three and her second husband? Who would orch=
estrate and then carry out this drive-by shooting... and why? In quick orde=
r investigators found the shooter and three other men who confessed about t=
heir roles in the scheme. They were drug addicts and petty thieves. Surpris=
ingly, they didn't know Heather Grossman or her husband. And they weren't l=
ooking to rob the couple. During interrogation all four men told the same s=
tory. They were given orders to kill Heather Grossman. As investigators kep=
t digging, the murder for hire plot began unraveling and all the evidence s=
eemed to lead to one conclusion. It would take nearly a decade for this mys=
tery to be resolved... and for the architect behind this devastating shooti=
ng to be brought to justice. You will hear from everyone involved in this e=
xplosive case... the victim, the shooter and the person who was convicted f=
or pulling the strings... in the next 48 Hours Mystery."=20

      October 1997, 31-year-old Heather Grossman and her husband, John, wer=

      fired on in their car at an intersection in broad daylight. It was cl=
