Greg, I quite clearly explained what I was talking about.  If you want to 
tell me I'm mistaken as to what is considered OT for this list, that would 
be fine. I think it's reasonable for someone who subscribes to a list named 
"speakup" to assume it's about speakup and NOT about orca. But whether the 
orca posts are technically off-topic is not the point.

Maybe you disagree with me but there is no reason to be rude.
