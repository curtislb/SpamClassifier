Mike and I prepared the enclosed poster with graphics displaying the
need for compulsory licenses and generic competition to achieve access
to second generation AIDS drugs.

It applauds the licenses in Brazil and Thailand as a needed first step.
And it provides an implicit warning against accepting new waves of price
cuts by patent holding companies as a condition for refusing to issue
compulsory licenses: the scale of price reductions needed to treat the
nearly 4 million people that will need access to second generation drugs
over the next decade can only be accomplished with the kind of
competitive provision of generic products in developing countries that
was achieved for the first generation of AIDS drugs.

This will be presented at the South African AIDS Conference on June 5
and 6.
