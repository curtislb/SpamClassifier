No, SELinux do not know anything about UIDs and does not care about UIDs
at all.

No, the problem is that inotifyfs has its own label and the policies
were not allowing smbd to access objects labeled that way.
The first time that label is met is when smbd calls the ioctl, and
that's where SELinux blocks it.

No workaround, except disabling SELinux or updating the policies.
New policy packages for FC6/F7 are on the way.

Simo.
