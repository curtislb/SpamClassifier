The current plan for us at OLPC is to re-evaluate 24-bit, 32bpp when the
LX arrives.  There's not much of a point of spending time on 1555 or
4444 on the GX right now.  If somebody wants to do some testing on 1555,
that would be fine.  Since there are already lots of developer machines
out there, and that's all that people have to work with, it would
probably be helpful to spend some time and get hard Xlib performance
numbers and oprofiles of some of the cases to make sure 1555 is better.

Again, Xlib's and cairo's pixman library has no MMX optimization for
1555, and therefore X11 pixmap conversions from anything to 1555 will
hurt more than anything to 565.  I guess that's not a problem for
Squeak, but it's a problem for everyone else.  We just need some
numbers.
