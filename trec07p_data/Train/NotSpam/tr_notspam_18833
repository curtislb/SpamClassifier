Larry Birkhead, the father of Anna Nicole’s baby, Dannielynn,
and his former lawyer, Debra Opri, are locked in a nasty war of
words – and legal battle. Showbiz Tonight with the inside story
of what really happened between them – as Birkhead was fighting
for the baby. Debra Opri is right here in the interview you
will see <b>exclusively</b>, only on Showbiz Tonight!

alone! The heated debate on TV's most provocative entertainment
news show.

<B>WHEN CRUSHES BECOME SOULMATES</B>
We've all had crushes --- but sometimes those crushes can
actually turn into a real relationship. That’s what happened to
Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, Michael Spielas and Catherine
Zeta-Jones, even Tori Spelling! Showbiz Tonight investigates
stars who kinda like someone, and then unexpectedly find their
prince – or princess – charming.
