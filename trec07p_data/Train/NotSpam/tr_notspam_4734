Yes, it's slightly easier to parse this way, and yes, it bugs me that
unless/else is not English, but mostly I changed it as a not-so-gentle
prod towards refactoring, based on the notion that if you have to
install a guard on a storage location being false, you've probably
got the scope of the storage location wrong.  And even if not, there
are several other ways to write it, at least one of which will be
generally more readable to other people.

I freely admit that it's less orthogonal and that I'm being high-handed. :)
