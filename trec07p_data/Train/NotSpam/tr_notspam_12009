Hi Spie,

Thanks for all your thoughts on this.  One of the things I love about 
linux is there is always a solution, it just needs an idea to put you on 
the right track.  There are specific responses to some of your suggestions 
below.

I personally haven't, but my friend who did the upgrade said they were 
both working fine before he tried to set the SB Live as the default.  I 
can play ogg files on the ensoniq card.

Sounds big, but I'm willing to try it if necessary.

Oh, trust me, I have.  And I haven't found anything useful yet.  Though 
that may well be because of my own lack of knowledge.

Another good thought.  I'll give it a go.

> BTW I love your email signature, 

Thank you.  The whole thing is beautiful.  I'm glad you quoted it.  I 
never get tired of reading it.

Thank you again.
