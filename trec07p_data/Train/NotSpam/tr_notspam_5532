						<div class=3D"GreyHeading">MANISH BHASIN ON THE CRICKET WORLD CUP FIN=
AL</div>
	<P>					<div>Australia take on Sri Lanka in the Cricket World Cup final in=
 Barbados on Saturday and the Aussies look unstoppable.=20
<br>

<br>
They've won every game comprehensively, they've been so clinical it's almos=
t frightening, and the only crack in their armour would appear to be compla=
cency.=20
<br>

<br>
They've yet to lose more than six wickets in a game so far and are unbeaten=
 in their past 28 World Cup games, but after such a great run the law of av=
erages says they are due to come unstuck at some stage.
<br>

<br>
The multi-talented Sri Lankans possess arguably the best bowling attack of =
the tournament and may have pulled off a masterstroke by not playing their =
three best bowlers against Australia in the Super Eight stage.=20
<br>

<br>
At the time I thought they had let themselves down slightly by not playing =
Chaminda Vaas, Muttiah Muralitharan and Lasith Malinga, but it could have a=
 bearing on the outcome.=20
<br>

<br>
In Malinga they have one of the stars of the World Cup.=20
<br>

<br>
Unbelievably the paceman has never faced Australia in a one-day internation=
al and has not played them in a Test since 2004.=20
<br>

<br>
This could work hugely in Sri Lanka's favour as he has come on leaps and bo=
unds since then and is such a devastating bowler because of his unique styl=
e of delivery.=20
<br>

<br>
There is no doubt that some aspects of the World Cup have been disappointin=
g, and the ICC must bear some responsibility for that.=20
<br>

<br>
By stopping musical instruments being brought into grounds and charging exo=
rbitant ticket prices, the much-anticipated local Caribbean flavour has bee=
n lost.=20
<br>

<br>
The tournament has also had to cope with the shocking death of Pakistan coa=
ch Bob Woolmer.=20
<br>

<br>
Everyone was talking about this being a carnival of cricket - let's hope th=
e final can be just that.=20
<br>

<br>
Enjoy the game,=20
<br>
