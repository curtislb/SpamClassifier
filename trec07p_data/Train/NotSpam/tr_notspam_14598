1. Short Sales Can Have Tax Consequences

When the outstanding debt against a property is more than the amount it is worth (often referred to as a "short sale" in the real estate industry), there can be tax consequences.  

If the property is sold and a lender agrees to cancel the remaining debt, the amount forgiven is generally taxable income.

2. Understanding Depreciation and the Section 179 Expense Deduction

Computing deductions for property you use in your business can be challenging. 

In general, if business property is expected to last more than one year, the entire cost cannot be deducted as a business expense in the year you place it into service.  It must be depreciated http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=137026,00.html over the property’s useful life (as defined by the Internal Revenue Code). 
 
Most types of tangible property (except land) such as buildings, machinery, vehicles, furniture, and equipment are depreciable. Likewise, certain intangible properties such as patents, copyrights, and computer software are depreciable.

You can elect to recover all or part of the cost of certain qualifying property (not buildings), up to a limit, by deducting it in the year you place the property in service. This is the section 179 deduction. http://www.irs.gov/publications/p946/ch02.html

3. Accounting Periods and Methods

All taxpayers – including small businesses – must report income and expenses on an annual basis.  

The most common accounting period http://www.irs.gov/publications/p538/ar02.html#d0e127  is the calendar year – January 1 through December 31.

The other option is a fiscal year which is 12 consecutive months ending on the last day of any month except December – for example July 1 through June 30.

An accounting method http://www.irs.gov/publications/p538/ar02.html#d0e1567 must also be established and generally does not change.  

The most common is the cash method where you report income in the tax year you receive it and deduct expenses in the tax year you pay them. 

Another option is the accrual method where you report income in the tax year you earn it, and deduct expenses in the tax year you incur them, regardless of when payment is made.
