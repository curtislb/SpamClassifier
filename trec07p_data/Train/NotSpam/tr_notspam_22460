Dear Internet Patrol Readers,

The interest and curiousity over the iPhone has reached a fever
pitch!  Analysts anticipate record lines at both Apple and AT&T
stores this Friday, when the iPhone officially goes on sale.

But *you* can get a sneak peak this Wednesday - two days early - 
with our special iPhone Scoop edition of our online show, Three Things
You Should Know!

Our special mystery guest, a noted expert in the Apple community, has
been using his iPhone since last week, and on Wednesday he is going to 
reveal all - to you - our faithful readers and listeners!

Everything you wanted to know about the iPhone, and more!

So tune in this Wednesday - that's just in *two* days - and two full
days earlier than the iPhone is even available to the general public!

Our show is online at http://clicks.suretymailings.com/z/ct/?sCn1HLZkZNZvbK1LOWEeRw

And to be sure that you don't miss the show, while you're at the site
you can sign up for our free email alerts of new shows, so that as soon 
as the show is available you'll receive an email reminder.

Impress all your friends with how much *you'll* know about the iPhone,
before it's even released!   Or tell them about it so that they can
listen too! http://clicks.suretymailings.com/z/ct/?sCn1HLZkZNZvbK1LOWEeRw

See you Wednesday!

P.S. If you read this far, as a special reward, if you would like to
*submit a question* for our mystery guest, about the iPhone, send your
question to info@threethingsyoushouldknow.com or info@theinternetpatrol.com .
Be sure to use a subject of "iPhone Question"
