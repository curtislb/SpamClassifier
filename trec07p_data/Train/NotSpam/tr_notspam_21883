You need to read
perldoc perlre

It's special because for some reason you chose to use the /x
modifier.  This modifier allows you to use both whitespace and
comments inside your regular expressions.

Since you obviously don't know what the /x modifier does, why are you
using it?  Blindly typing code that you don't understand is a really
bad way to program.

Paul Lalli

P.S.  (Yes, I know PBP recommends always using /mxs, but anyone who
uses /msx on every regexp because PBP recommends it should at least
read enough of PBP to know *why* its recommended)
