This is actually news from last year, but for those keeping tally of
compulsory licensed issued worldwide, or comparing compulsory licenses
issued in rich countries with those in developing nations, add this: the
United States automatically compulsory licenses ring tones.

United States: Copyright Office Gives Go-Ahead To Ringtone Licensing*
17 May 2007
*Article by Ronald Clayton and Simon A. Fitzpatrick*

*This article was first published in /World Copyright Law Report/ on
December 7, 2006."*

The *US Copyright Office* <http://www.copyright.gov/> has issued a
*decision* <http://www.copyright.gov/docs/ringtone-decision.pdf> ruling
that ringtones that are excerpts of longer musical works or that are
taken from existing sound recordings are subject to the compulsory
licence provisions of US copyright law under *17 USC §115*
<http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode17/usc_sec_17_00000115----000-.html>.
However, ringtones that recast, transform or adapt existing musical
works or that add new material so as to create a new derivative work
cannot be used under the compulsory licence regime.

This issue was referred to the Copyright Office by the *US Copyright
Royalty Board* <http://www.loc.gov/crb/>, which administers the
compulsory licence system. The outcome is that compositions covered by
the compulsory licence provisions will now be subject to the board's
rate-setting proceeding, whereas derivative works that are not covered
by Section 115 must be licensed at a royalty rate negotiated with the
copyright owner.

This is a good result for record labels wanting to sell ringtone
providers the master rights and publishing rights together. In a
statement following the Copyright Office's announcement, a
representative of the *Recording Industry Association of America*
<http://www.riaa.com/default.asp> emphasized the benefits to consumers
in the flourishing market for ringtones:

/

"This decision injects clarity into the marketplace - clarity that will
help satisfy fans' hunger for the latest hits from today's best artists
by affording record companies and ringtone providers the ability to move
new offerings quickly and easily to consumers."

/

In contrast to the record industry's response, music publishers have
expressed disappointment at the decision to broaden the reach of
compulsory licence provisions. A spokeswoman for the *National Music
Publishers' Association* <http://www.nmpa.org/home/index.asp> stated
that the result of the decision could harm songwriters:

/

"Of particular concern is that copyright owners who have negotiated
ringtone licences in the free market for years will now be subject to
government regulation. We see no justification for this, and are
currently reviewing our legal options."

/

The next phase of the proceedings relating to use of compositions as
ringtones is the setting of the compulsory licence royalty rates.
Submissions from interested parties were made in November, and it will
be interesting to see what the industry reaction is once the impact of
compulsory licences on the ringtone market can be measured in dollars
and cents.
