[0]Lucas123 writes "An alarming number of women [1]are currently
abandoning IT jobs that require workers to be on-call at all hours,
according to a story in Computerworld. [2]One study cited in the article
states that by 2012, 40% of women now working in IT will leave for
careers with more flexible hours. 'I think women in that regard are at a
real disadvantage,' said Dot Brunette, network and storage manager at
Meijer Inc., a Grand Rapids, Mich.-based retailer and a 30-year IT
veteran. She noted that companies can fail to attract female workers, or
see them leave key IT jobs, because they fail to provide day care at
work, or work-at-home options for someone who leaves to have a child.'"

Thib writes "A study from the Pew Internet and American Life Project
reveals that the majority of teens [0]pay attention to what they are
revealing about themselves in their online social profiles. For instance,
while many routinely use their first name or include a picture, 'fewer
than a third of teens with profiles use their last names, and a similar
number include their e-mail addresses. Only 2 percent list their cell
phone numbers.' The study comes to light just as state legislatures once
again begin to mutter about the dangers of online predators. From the
article: 'According to Pew, 45 percent of online teens do not have
profiles at all, a figure that contradicts widespread perceptions that
the nation's youths are continually on MySpace.'"

hack was based on a Safari vulnerability found by Dai Zovi and written in

rules to make the hack possible, because initially nobody at the event
could breach the computers under the original restrictions. 'Dai Zovi

Thursday if a previously unknown Apple bug was used. "Shane can have the

An anonymous reader writes "It may be that [0]brown dwarfs are the
'missing step' between the radio emissions we see generated by the planet
Jupiter and what are received from pulsars. Brown dwarfs are, of course,
'failed' stars. They emit extremely strong beams of radiation, like a
standard star, but are behaving on the whole more like a pulsar. 'Greg
Hallinan from the National University of Ireland in Galway and his
colleagues used the Very Large Array radio telescope in New Mexico to
observe a very cool, rapidly rotating brown dwarf called TVLM 513-46546.
A bright flash from the brown dwarf was observed roughly every two hours,
and are very similar to those observed from pulsars. But this whole
system is on a much slower and smaller scale, so it is easier for
astronomers to decipher what is going on. For some time, scientists have
wondered if there were similarities between this type of emission and the
periodic radio beams from pulsars. Observations of TVLM 513-46546 could
provide the first direct evidence for such a link."

chips also consume better than 20% more power than their last batch. 'The
2222 SE, for dual-processor systems, costs $873 in quantities of 1,000,
according to the Web site, and the 8222 SE, for systems with four or
eight processors costs $2,149 for quantities of 1,000. For comparison,
the 2.8GHz 2220 SE and 8220 SE cost $698 and $1,514 in that quantity. AMD
spokesman Phil Hughes confirmed that the company has begun shipping the
new chips. The company will officially launch the products Monday, he

migrating every two to three years. Other studios are following suit, but
what about indie features? Will we lose films like we [1]lost the

The technology promised a way to link packaging to Web sites — and once
cell phone cameras get good enough, Microsoft hoped lots of people would
use it. It seems the technology has finally found a home: the ISAN
International Agency has inked a deal with Microsoft. The color barcodes,
consisting of red, green, yellow, and black triangles, will appear on
XBox 360 games and other products beginning later this year.

An anonymous reader tipped us to a [0]protest song RMS has written and
recorded (while [1]visiting Cuba) and is hosting on stallman.org. It's a
sort of parody, although it's too serious really to be called that, in
Spanish of the song "Guantanamera," in which a Gitmo prisoner talks about
his experiences and mourns his fate. RMS wrote the lyrics in 2006 after
learning what "Guantanamera" actually means. The lyrics are moving, and
the recording, in Ogg, is competent — RMS sings well and he's got some
amateur musicians from Cuba backing him up. Here are the [2]lyrics and an
English translation.

Several readers sent us to the New York Times for disturbing news on
[0]Russia's vanishing press freedoms. The story tells of how one of the
few remaining relatively independent radio outlets in Russia recently
acquired new managers, reportedly loyal to Vladimir Putin. Quoting: "At
their first meeting with journalists since taking over Russia's largest
independent radio news network, the managers had startling news of their
own: from now on, they said, at least 50 percent of the reports about
Russia must be 'positive.' In addition, opposition leaders could not be
mentioned on the air and the United States was to be portrayed as an
enemy, journalists employed by the network, Russian News Service, say
they were told by the new managers, who are allies of the Kremlin."
