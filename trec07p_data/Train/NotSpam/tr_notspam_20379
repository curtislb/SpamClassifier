Fantastic. All of those methods worked, though I did have to first convert my matrices using the data.matrix command. Thank you for the assistance.

Is there any equally simple way to re-convert the resulting table/matrix to its original NxN form? I do not see any obvious opposites to the cbind or as.table commands.

Also, Jeff Laake, is there a way to have your routine output the vectors as numeric values (i.e., without the surrounding quote marks)?

Best regards,

I have an nxn matrix, Q, where Q[i,j] is a directed value (in this case, oil exports from i to j). Note that Q[i,j]~=Q[j,i]. I imported column names along with the matrix then copied them to the rows using rownames(Q) <- colnames(Q). Simple so far.

Having one vector each for row, column, and cell would be ideal, e.g., [1,1] = i's name, [1,2] = j's name, and [1,3] = Q[i, j]. But just being able to export my matrix data in vector form with the correct row/col names for each observation would be sufficient.
