Lou Dobbs Tonight
Tuesday May 1, 2007

Tonight, rallies across America spur the illegal immigration
debate; President Bush set to veto the Democrats’ Iraq war
funding bill. We’ll have full coverage, live from the White
House.

Congressman James Sensenbrenner sparked pro-amnesty rallies
across the country last year with legislation, H.R. 4437, which
would have cracked down on illegal aliens living in America.
But his bill met defeat along with the President’s request for
a guest worker program. This spring, the amnesty movement
gained momentum once again, giving President Bush renewed hope
that his guest-worker program could gain approval in Congress.
This March, Congressman Flake and Gutierrez introduced an
amnesty plan in the House, while Senator Kennedy put a bill
before the Senate that would grant amnesty to illegal aliens.
Join us tonight, we’ll be taking a look at the marches on
Capitol Hill and examining whether amnesty really has a better
chance this time around.

Two to ten thousand pro-amnesty supporters are expected to take
to the streets of Phoenix, Arizona, a city often the first stop
and a hub for illegal immigration from Mexico. The protestors
begin their route at the state fair grounds and head to the
Arizona State Capitol building. Protestors have been instructed
to wear white t-shirts and carry American flags, a diversion
from last year, when tens of thousands took to the streets of
Phoenix carrying flags from all over. We’ll have a special
report.

And we’ll also have full coverage of the pro-amnesty marches
going on across the country today and a report from what is
expected to be the largest rally in Los Angeles.

U.S. taxpayers are footing the bill for the millions of illegal
aliens residing in this country. While illegal aliens are given
free medical care and education they are also able to open bank
accounts, apply for mortgages, licenses and in some states pay
in-state tuition rates for college education. Join us tonight,
we’ll examine why thousands of illegal aliens are taking to the
streets across America when they are living a life most U.S.
citizens cannot enjoy.	

The FDA Commissioner is on the hot seat at the House Oversight
Committee over the recent revelations that food safety in
America is at risk. Budgets have been slashed and inspections
are sporadic at a time when food imports are at an all time
high. The commission will look at the egregious slip ups in
safety and examine potential solutions. We’ll have a special
report.

And in light of today’s pro-amnesty rallies, President and CEO
of the National Council of La Raza Janet Murguia joins Lou to
discuss all the topics surrounding illegal immigration.
