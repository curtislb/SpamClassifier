perldoc perldata

     Entire arrays (and slices of arrays and hashes) are denoted
     by '@', which works much like the word "these" or "those"
     does in English, in that it indicates multiple values are
     expected.

         @days               # ($days[0], $days[1],... $days[n])
         @days[3,4,5]        # same as ($days[3],$days[4],$days[5])
         @days{'a','c'}      # same as ($days{'a'},$days{'c'})

absolutely no idea what's making you think any of this is necessary.

No kidding.  Did  you read my reply?  That's exactly what I said would
happen.  Declare your hash in the smallest scope possible - inside the
(first) for loop.  That way, when each iteration of the for loop
starts, you get a brand new hash rather than reusing the same one.

If you don't understand what that means - move the 'my %hash;' line
from where it is to just before the 'my @columns = $csv->fields ();'
line.
