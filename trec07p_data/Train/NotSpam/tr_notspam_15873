Hello!  I've run a sugar-jhbuild, and with a work-around hack to get 
around my previous problem, I can now run the sugar desktop.  However, 
when I click to start an activity, it will show up in the ring for a 
little while (a few seconds) then disappear, never starting fully.  Here 
is a complete log of a sugar session in which I try to start the Write 
activity: presumably the interesting stuff is at the end.  (I'm on AMD64 
if that makes a difference, Ubuntu Feisty)

I am wondering if there is anything I can do to fix this issue, or if it 
is a problem in the source.  (and if so, if it's easy enough for me to 
fix).  Thanks for your help!
