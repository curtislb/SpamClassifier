I believe this is a very simple question or at least I'm hoping ...

I am trying to select items from a table where the miles field is not
null or blank and the below statement does not work.  Does anyone have
any suggestions?

Thanks!

            @resultkeys =3D ("Date","People","Miles","Savings");

            $sql =3D "SELECT c.objectid,c.dateadded as
\"Date\",c.totalpeople as \"People\", ";

            $sql .=3D "c.miles as Miles, c.totalsaved as \"Savings\" ";

            $sql .=3D "FROM OWNER.CONFERENCE c";

            $sql .=3D " WHERE c.miles <> "";

            $sql .=3D " ORDER BY c.datestart";
