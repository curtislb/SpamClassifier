Thai Health Minister Mongkol to chair UNAIDS board
Bangkok, May 21: Thailand's Public Health Minister Mongkol Na
Songkhla has been appointed chairman of the UNAIDS board, effective
late next month.

Dr. Peter Piot, head of the joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS,
invited Dr. Mongkol to take up the post as the chairman of the
programme coordinating board for the joint United Nations Programme
on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) on June 25 for a one-year period. He succeeds
Sweden's Minister for International Development Cooperation Carin
Jamtin.

Dr. Mongkol said he would chair his first meeting of the UNAIDS board
on June 25.

He said he had accepted the invitation by Dr. Piot because of his
support for Thailand since December last year on the issue of
compulsory licensing for drugs treating heart disease and HIV/AIDS.

In accepting the post, Dr. Mongkol said it was an honour for Thailand
as the country had managed to control the deadly AIDS problem to a
relatively satisfactory level, for which the kingdom has been
recognized by the international community.

The UNAIDS board comprises 37 members, 22 of which are from member
countries, 10 from UN agencies and the remaining five from social
organisations. Board members hold two meetings annually.

He said his immediate task in the job was to reform the agency,
because over 40 million people worldwide were HIV/AIDS infected and
95 per cent of them live in developing countries. Most people with
HIV/AIDS acquired the disease through having sex without using condoms.
