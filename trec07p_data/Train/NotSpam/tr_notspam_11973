Yes.  The only drawback I can see is that it's no longer "charitable" when
they are fed back into the commercial ticketing system, you'd have to create
some kind of not-for-profit deriv.  Renders the whole thing a bit of a
non-starter.  Though having said that they could do "free" concerts and
bring along the t-shirts and the merch......who knows.

Yeah, that's a shame.  To be honest I'm not entirely convinced they're aware
of the options, otherwise they may have opted for something more open.
Reading their occasional interviews and posts they seem keen to duck out of
the traditional systems.  I was also encouraged recently by something Thom
York said about wanting to do something similar in Time Magazine.

Should CC have some kind of lobbying group to stalk these artists? lol :)

Yes.  That's exactly the kind of thing I'd love to see, and I agree, I'd
happily pay good money for something like that.  I think one of the issues
with CDs is that the price remained fixed whilst the "costs" bottomed out.
Most music lovers and consumers are well aware of the costs now, especially
as daily newspapers include "free" CDs and DVDs whilst still paying dues to
the artists and creators.  It's difficult to convince people to pay for data
I guess.

So it's the additional and exclusive things people expect to pay more for,
the physical things they can touch, wear or play with.  I kept my old vinyl
because some of the artwork is simply iconic, awesome stuff from the 70s and
80s.  I was thinking of framing some of those old album covers.

It'd be great to bring back that sense of ownership, the internet is a great
place for things like fanclubs and fan-feedback, though we're not seeing so
much of that just yet - beyond myspace..

Again, very much agreed.  I don't like the idea for that reason, it's more
of the same thing but with the convenience of lower risk by burdoning the
fans with the setup/recording costs.  A lot of the news repotage talks of
$50,000+ for recording fees, sounds to me like a studio somewhere is making
a good living out of it!

Yeah, what's kinda happening is the music industry in China is accepting
their fate of every release being BY-ND :)  I agree, removing the ND and
replacing it with an SA would be an interesting experiment.

If you ever start this, count me in ;)
