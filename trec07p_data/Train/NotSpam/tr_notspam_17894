You've just opened up another bit of confusion.   A submission package has=
=20
many pieces, and that cited one is just a small part of it.

As Frank has mentioned (though perhaps tritely), and Cody points out --=20

The only issue that a Pharma has to worry about is whether they know enough=
=20
about a software language/application to trust it.  Period.  There are=20
incantations and approaches for this, but working through a corporation of=
=20
diverse skills and knowledge, to justify the use of a particular tool=20
(whether it is statistical, legal, chemical, etc) with in the corporation,=
=20
brings up the need to follow whatever implementation the company has done=20
using the guidelines from FDA, EMEA, PMDA, etc...

But it's the company guidelines, and the company's due diligence that is=20
important.

NOT the external view.   So the idea of computer systems validation, and th=
e=20
qualification of programming languages such as R and SAS is a good one, sin=
ce=20
it helps you understand where the weaknesses in computed results might be,=
=20
for weighting results for internal decision making and knowledge management.

But much of it has to be done internally.  The side problem of "few people=
=20
using S in clinical statistics" is related to the risks that a company has =
in=20
having people that know about R, etc.  That is the practical issue, solvabl=
e=20
when budgets exist and when it falls into strategy.

Sorry for getting on the soap-box, but I've just had a nasty week dealing w=
ith=20
the results from  simplified bullet points which skip the major important=20
complexities which were handled badly by decisions made using the summudles=
=2E =20
Ugly, ugly nonsense.

And Computer Systems validation is a canonical area where the above paragra=
ph=20
holds.

best,
=2Dtony.
