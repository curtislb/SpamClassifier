Noob 1st time poster: I too love Debian and use it as my main OS on my box. I also had Etch running on my IBM T43 and 
actually got the ipw2200 working till a kernel upgrade came through and then I lost wireless and being a noob I 
couldn't get it going again :-)
I tried Linux Mint (Cassandra) and only one click got my wireless working.
All the Beryl things work out of the box too. And the T43 doesn't have Nvidia.
Regards
Geoff
