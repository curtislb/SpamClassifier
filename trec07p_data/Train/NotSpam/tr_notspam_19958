In a court where a choice of venue clause holds water, in all likelihood the
court will not deem the normal jurisdictional rules to be overridden until
they're shown that you've *accepted* the license.  If the plaintiff can't
show this, the nuisance suit stops there.

If they *can* show this, you get the choices mentioned before.

You might still wind up with summary judgement against you in a foreign
court if the copyright holder fools the judge and you don't have the
resources to contest their claim; but that's more of a gamble, the copyright
holder has to convince a judge both that you've accepted the license and
that you've violated it.

Yes, there is some risk of a nuisance suit when you haven't accepted the
license, but that's our baseline which is unrelated to whether the license
is free.  If distributing code under the license increases the
odds/decreases the cost of a malicious copyright holder being able to pull
this off, and concommitantly increases the odds of a malicious copyright
holder *trying* to pull this off, I don't think that should be ignored.

I think it's also an issue when you have a malicious copyright holder who
believes they can convince the /judge/ that there's a possibility.

Is that going to be the case for anyone who redistributes Debian or
distributes modified versions of packages received from us?

Should a license problem be ignored on the grounds that we think the Free
Software community will stick together in the event the problem clause is
invoked?

And it still doesn't, a whole 10 days later?  Pff, doesn't anybody on these
lists have a sense of entrepreneurship?

In the blackjack case, you're only being compelled at the copyright holder's
whim.  In the choice of venue case, if there is no restriction preventing
the clause from being invoked on licensees who don't have a legal presence
in the named district, you are also being compelled to appear in court.  The
consequences for refusing to appear in court are different than the
consequences for refusing to play blackjack, but to me they do seem
analogous in that a requirement is being conditionally imposed on the
licensee that has nothing to do with the software itself.

If Debian has competent legal advice to the effect that this choice of venue
language will only take effect for licensees that already have a legal
presence in the named districts, then I withdraw my objection; but I don't
think that's the plain English reading of the clause at hand.

Yes, it's the "if you distribute the covered work, you agree that the
licensor may sue you in Berlin, Germany".

Sure. :)
