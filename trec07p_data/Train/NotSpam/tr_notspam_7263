DEM LEADERS DROP DEMAND FOR A TIMELINE TO BRING TROOPS HOME: President Bush and congressional leaders began negotiating
a second war funding bill yesterday, with Democrats offering the first major concession: an agreement to drop their
demand for a timeline to bring troops home from Iraq. Democrats backed off after the House failed, on a vote of 222 to
203, to override the president's veto of a $124 billion measure that would have required U.S. forces to begin
withdrawing as early as July. But party leaders made it clear that the next bill will have to include language that
influences war policy. Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (Nev.) outlined a second measure that would step up Iraqi
accountability, "transition" the U.S. military role and show "a reasonable way to end this war." Washington Post:
Democrats Back Down On Iraq Timetable
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/02/AR2007050201517.html

SOME REPUBLICANS "BEGINNING TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE WHITE HOUSE": Distressed by the violence in Iraq and worried about
tying their political fate to an unpopular president, some Republicans on Capitol Hill are beginning to move away from
the White House to stake out a more critical position on the U.S. role in the war. These lawmakers are advocating
proposals that would tie the U.S. commitment in the war to the Iraqi government's ability to demonstrate that it is
working to quell the sectarian conflict. As Democrats start work on a new war spending bill to replace the one
President Bush vetoed, at least three Republican senators who opposed the Democratic withdrawal plan said Wednesday
that the new bill should include so-called benchmarks for the Iraqi government to meet. Los Angeles Times: Some
Republicans split with Bush on the war
http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-warfunds3may03,0,7640493.story

IRAQI PARLIAMENT PLANS 2-MONTH RECESS: Lawmakers divided over whether to keep U.S. troops in Iraq are finding common
ground on at least one topic: They are furious that Iraqi politicians are considering a lengthy break this summer. "If
they go off on vacation for two months while our troops fight - that would be the outrage of outrages," said Rep. Chris
Shays, R-Conn. The Iraq parliament's recess, starting this July, would likely come without Baghdad politicians reaching
agreements considered key to easing sectarian tensions. Examples include regulating distribution of the country's oil
wealth and reversing measures that have excluded many Sunnis from jobs and government positions because of Baath party
membership. Talk of the adjournment comes amid a heated debate in Congress on the pullout of U.S. troops in Iraq. AP

VETO PEN A GIFT FROM FALLEN SOLDIER'S FATHER: President Bush on Tuesday used a regular black-ink, felt-tip pen not his
usual personalized Cross-brand pen when he vetoed a timeline for withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq. The pen was a
gift from Robert Derga, the father of a U.S. Marine killed in Iraq. Mr. Derga of Uniontown, Ohio, gave Mr. Bush the pen
after a speech by the president last month at the White House and had asked him to use it when he vetoed the timeline.
Mr. Bush had invited a number of "Gold Star Families" those who have lost a U.S. military member in Iraq to the speech
April 16 and met with them afterward in the Oval Office. Mr. Derga, 53, said the pen was the one he used to write
letters to his son, Marine Cpl. Dustin A. Derga. Washington Times: Using $2 veto pen a priceless act for father of
fallen Marine http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20070502-112507-2019r.htm

LEAHY SUBPOENAS ROVE EMAILS: Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) issued a subpoena yesterday to
Attorney General Alberto Gonzales for all e-mails from White House adviser Karl Rove that relate to the 2006 firings of
eight U.S. attorneys. In a letter to Gonzales, Leahy also harshly criticized the Department of Justice (DoJ) for not
being responsive to congressional requests for information... The subpoena requires Gonzales to appear before the
committee on May 15 and to provide "all e-mails and attachments to e-mails to, from, or copied to Karl Rove related to
the Committee's investigation into the preservation of prosecutorial independence and the Department of Justice's
politicization of the hiring and firing and decision-making of United States Attorneys." The Hill: Rove e-mails
subpoenaed http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/rove-e-mails-subpoenaed-2007-05-02.html

GOODLING ACCUSED OF HAVING BASED HIRING ON POLITICS: The Justice Department has launched an internal investigation into
whether Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales's former White House liaison illegally took party affiliation into account
in hiring career federal prosecutors, officials said yesterday. The allegations against Monica M. Goodling represent a
potential violation of federal law and signal that a joint probe begun in March by the department's inspector general
and Office of Professional Responsibility has expanded beyond the controversial dismissal of eight U.S. attorneys last
year. Washington Post: Ex-Aide to Gonzales Accused Of Bias
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/02/AR2007050201569.html

KENDRICK MEEK LIKES A FINE MEAL: A Roll Call review of [Kendrick] Meek's official campaign committee's filings with the
Federal Election Commission since 2003 reveal the Florida lawmaker's preference for using high-end meals,
accommodations and trendy hot spots across the country to raise that money. For Meek, that's just part of the game.
"To be a part of the discussion and the art of politics is going to cost money," Meek said in an interview Wednesday...
If the disclosures are any indication, Meek's approach is to do business over steak. Since 2003, he has spent nearly
$30,000 in high-end steakhouses alone, including 47 listed disbursements at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse in downtown
Washington, D.C. He also has listed disbursements at the Silver Slipper ("Tallahassee's Premier Steak House"), Smith &
Wollensky, The Forge and Houston's, all located in the Miami area, Charlie Palmer Steak and The Capital Grille in
Washington, and Russell's Restaurant in Vail, Colorado. Meek has spent an additional $51,000 since 2003 at other
restaurants that rate among finer dining establishments. Roll Call: Meek Raises, Spends Cash in Style

SHOWDOWN IN SIMI VALLEY: When all 10 Republican presidential candidates gather in California tonight for the first GOP
debate, some of the loudest voices are likely to be of those contenders polling in the back of the pack. Just as
little-known former senator Mike Gravel of Alaska drew chuckles at last week's Democratic candidates' debate by saying
of his competitors on the stage, "Some of these people frighten me," GOP candidates such as Representatives Ron Paul ,
Duncan Hunter, and Tom Tancredo will be looking to make a big splash. Spokespeople for the news organizations
sponsoring the debates, who approved participation by all 10 declared candidates for the GOP's first national debate
tonight, said they wanted to be as inclusive as possible in selecting the debate participants. But with just 90 minutes
to share among candidates and questioners, each contender will have little time to make his case to GOP primary voters
and little opportunity to distinguish himself from other contenders. Boston Globe: In GOP debate, a chance to stand out
http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/05/03/in_gop_debate_a_chance_to_stand_out/

CANDIDATES VEXED OVER WHAT TO SAY ABOUT W.: As they gather Thursday night at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library for
their first debate, the Republican presidential candidates are thrilled at the chance to associate themselves with
Reagan. But they may not be able to escape the challenge created for them by the current president. As much as Iraq or
health care or any other issue, the question of how to deal with President Bush is vexing the Republican field. Do they
embrace him as a means of appealing to the conservative voters who tend to decide Republican primudles? Or do they
break from him in an effort to show that they will lead the nation in a new direction? Do they applaud his policies or
question his competence - or both? New York Times: G.O.P. Contenders Ponder What to Say About Bush
http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/03/us/politics/03repubs.html

NANCY REAGAN TO "SHARE THE LIMELIGHT": Former first lady Nancy Reagan, who has nurtured her husband's legacy, will
share the limelight Thursday as Republican presidential candidates try to lay claim to the Reagan mantle. Nancy Reagan,
83, will be in attendance but is not expected to speak at the GOP candidates' first debate of the 2008 primary at The
Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif., according to library officials. "Ronnie always hoped the
library would be a place where policymakers will debate the future," Nancy Reagan said in a statement announcing the
debate in February. "This presidential debate provides the opportunity to fulfill his wishes." AP via Yahoo! News:

"SIGNIFICANT HURDLES" FOR GOP CANDIDATES: The political landscape for the 2008 presidential election is shaping up with
a decided tilt in the direction of Democrats. Long before either party has settled on a presidential candidate,
fundamental factors that lay the groundwork for next year's election - from anti-war sentiment to a drain in
GOP-leaning voters to the simple patterns of history - are creating significant hurdles for the Republicans who hope to
succeed President Bush. Republicans' main hope: that the strengths of their particular nominee and the weaknesses of
the Democratic one will offset their uphill climb. USA Today: 5 reasons the GOP faces an uphill climb in '08

OBAMA'S "TOUGH LOVE," CRITICISM FOR BLACK COMMUNITY: Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) is delivering pointed critiques of the
African American community as he campaigns for its votes, lamenting that many of his generation are "disenfranchising"
themselves because they don't vote, taking rappers to task for their language, and decrying "anti-intellectualism" in
the black community, including black children telling peers who get good grades that they are "acting white." As he
travels around the country in his effort to become the nation's first black president, Obama has engaged in an intense
competition for black voters -- a crucial Democratic Party constituency that accounts for as much as half the
electorate in some key primary states such as South Carolina. But the first-term senator, who has sought to present
himself as an agent of change eager to challenge political convention, has taken the unusual route of publicly
criticizing his own community. Washington Post: Obama Reaches Out With Tough Love
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/02/AR2007050202813.html

"BITTER STRUGGLE" OVER MYSPACE PAGE: The rapidly emerging tension between the unruly world of online politics and the
highly controlled machinery of a presidential campaign was made vivid in a bitter struggle that erupted this week for
control of a MySpace page listed under the name Barack Obama. The Democratic senator's campaign stirred a spirited
debate and some harsh criticism on progressive political blogs after it wrested control on Monday of the page on the
popular social-networking site. The episode pits a feeling of ownership that online grass-roots activists may have for
content they create in support of a candidate against a political campaign's desire to keep strict control over the
image it projects to voters. Chicago Tribune: HisSpace: Obama seizes backer's site
http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/chi-0705030034may03,1,1471532.story

ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER THOMPSON STORY: Fred D. Thompson never took an acting class, performed in summer stock or dreamed
of Hollywood fame. But one day a big-name director, preparing a film about political corruption that Thompson had
exposed, asked him to play himself in the movie. A star was born. Thompson, then a lawyer, went on to make 23 movies,
countless television programs and millions of dollars. Now, the accidental actor is being urged to take another role he
has not been gunning for, as a growing crowd of conservatives clamors for him to run for the Republican nomination for
president. Other candidates have been refining their game plans for years, but the former senator from Tennessee has
glided almost without effort to a strong position in the early polls, even though most voters know him only as a
district attorney on television's "Law & Order." Los Angeles Times: Fred Thompson: Actor, politician, candidate?

JIM McGREEVEY BECOMING A PRIEST: Call him Father Jim. Gay former Gov. Jim McGreevey is becoming an Episcopal priest and
has been accepted to study at a seminary school in Chelsea. The lapsed Catholic will enter a three-year master of
divinity program at the General Theological Seminary in September, while undergoing the long process of ordination at
St. Bartholomew's Church on Park Avenue. McGreevey, who sensationally announced that he was a "gay American" after
former lover and aide Golan Cipel threatened to out him, went through the first step to becoming a priest on Sunday
when he was received into the Episcopal church. New York Post: HEAVEN HELP US! MCG TO BE PRIEST
