  <pre wrap="">Hi Dessi,

This is a report made by IBM that was made available under a CC license.

<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://domino.research.ibm.com/comm/www_innovate.nsf/images/gio-ip/">http://domino.research.ibm.com/comm/www_innovate.nsf/images/gio-ip/</a>

In this case, IBM thought that what is goog for the industry is good  
for her and the more the word about this work is spread, the more it  
will benefit IBM in the end.

Also, there is another example, applied to scientific digital  
libraries, that are in the process of adopting CC licenses as a  
standard for the publications that are willing to be indexed and  
available through this service. The site is in spanish but might help  
you for a screenshot or to illustrate your point. The site is <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://">http://</a> 
<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="http://www.redalyc.org">www.redalyc.org</a> . This is a site for a network of science magazines  
that sees the value of CC licensing in that it aids and simplifies  
citation and distribution of knowledge. As researchers, they are most  
interested on being cited as many times as they can.

I think it all depends on the kind of information they're generating  
and the final destination it is sought to have for such information.

Bes,

I need it for a project to provide training materials for the  
managers of companies from the industry which generate usually  
exclusively copyrighted knowledge, and I want to say and provide  
examples that sometimes CC is better and useful choice.

Thanks in advance!
