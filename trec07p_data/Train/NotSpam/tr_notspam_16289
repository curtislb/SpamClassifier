You don't need to use the Samba4 build system to have separate
includes for generated prototypes. Just have a target in Makefile.in
for each subsys_proto.h you want. It is a couple of Makefile lines per
subsystem.

See the script/minimal_includes.h script, which works out which
include files can be removed. So you run:

  script/minimal_includes.pl

and it tells you things like this:

 Processing common/ctdb_recover.c (with 709 lines)
   common/ctdb_recover.c: might be able to remove #include "lib/events/events.h"
   common/ctdb_recover.c: might be able to remove #include "lib/tdb/include/tdb.h"
   common/ctdb_recover.c: might be able to remove #include "system/wait.h"
   common/ctdb_recover.c: might be able to remove #include "lib/util/dlinklist.h"

As for the 'nightmare' to pick the right includes, I think you will
find it is not so hard, and it is essential if you want to get rid of
the problems raised in this thread. With a single includes.h you won't
get the incremental builds for example.

Cheers, Tridge
