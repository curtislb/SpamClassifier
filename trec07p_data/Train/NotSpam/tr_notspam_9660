I haven't made a particular choice yet.  I put it on hiatus because I hated 
the hack for dealing with special forms (particularly 'if'), and hope to port 
the compiler to HLLCompiler.pir and the PAST step to PAST-pm at some point in 
the near future.

r6 is fine.

Patrick or Allison knows better.

That seems reasonable to me.

HLLCompiler can do this with little effort.  I usually modify 
lib/PhemeCompiler.pir and uncomment the appropriate line in compile().  It 
really needs a port to HLLCompiler.

The brute force application of your head against a wall.

Be my guest.

I'm not sure what Patrick's new languages/abc plan means for Pheme, but it's 
unlikely I'll have time to absorb the new features and get Pheme up to date 
with regard to HLLCompiler in the next couple of weeks.
