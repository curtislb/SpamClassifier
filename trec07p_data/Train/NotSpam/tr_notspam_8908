						WEDNESDAY 9 MAY 22:30 BST - BBC TWO</div>
					<div>
					<DIV CLASS=3DBlackHeading>
						FROM PROGRAMME PRODUCER CAROL RUBRA
					</DIV><BR>
					Hello,<BR>
					<BR>
=09=09=09=09=09
						<DIV CLASS=3DRedHeading>
=09=09=09=09=09=09=09
						</DIV>
						Tonight,
<br>

<br>
In an attempt to make the Home Office "fit for purpose", it has been split =
into two separate ministries; one will focus on counter-terrorism and the o=
ther will manage the prison and justice system. Yet the architect of this m=
akeover, John Reid, has announced he's leaving before the job is done. Will=
 the Home office ever be "fit for purpose"?  In a special programme, we exa=
mine the key issues facing an incoming Home Secretary and new Prime Ministe=
r.
<br>

<br>
<b>SECURITY</b>=20
<br>

<br>
Will the newly structured Home Office, with its greater focus on counter-te=
rrorism, ensure that the mistakes made leading up to the 7th July bomb atta=
cks never happen again? With four people arrested today in connection with =
the bomb attacks in London we have been in Beeston. The man who warned West=
 Yorkshire police about Mohammed Sidique Khan, two years before the attacks=
, tells us that the police failed to respond to his warnings. Could they ha=
ve intervened earlier and prevented the 7th July bombings?=20
<br>

<br>
<b>PRISONS AND THE JUDICIARY</b>
<br>

<br>
The challenges facing the newly formed justice ministry are just as pressin=
g. The prison population is rapidly approaching capacity and some senior ju=
dges have severe reservations about bringing the prisons and courts into th=
e same department. Today, Lord Falconer has unveiled his blueprint for his =
ministry - but will it work?=20
<br>

<br>
<b>ASYLUM</b>=20
<br>

<br>
Can the asylum system ever give protection to those who need it while preve=
nting the thousands who seek to abuse it from doing so? Paul Mason has the =
story of a Zimbabwean Trade Union activist whose two adult children applied=
 for asylum in the UK. One was granted asylum, the other was refused. What =
does this say about the state of the asylum system?
<br>

<br>
<b>BLAIR</b>
<br>

<br>
And it's possibly been one of the most stage-managed departures in politica=
l history. David Grossman takes a look at some of the preparations which ar=
e under way ahead of Tony Blair's much trailed announcement of when he is s=
tepping down as Prime Minister.
<br>

<br>
All at 10.30pm.
