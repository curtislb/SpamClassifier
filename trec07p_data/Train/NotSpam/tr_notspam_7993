Actually, it wouldn't be all that difficult. All we have to do is ask.
I bet that most people would be happy to send us their logs if we asked them
nicely. We already bother them with various other requests, this wouldn't
be a major thing for most people.

Cc:ing and MFT'ing debian-mirrors for further discussion of this particular
aspect.

As it happens, the other day I was going about fixing up our own HTTP daemon
log analysis for www.debian.org - we had the logs on our machine, but nobody
noticed that our webalizer cron jobs died due to an upgrade. My point being,
just because it's on project-owned machines that doesn't necessarily mean
that we'll do a particularly good job of it :) the other volunteers who
don't happen to be official developers but contribute their knowledge as
mirror admins could almost as easily help collect this data.
