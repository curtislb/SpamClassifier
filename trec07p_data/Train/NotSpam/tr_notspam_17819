I found the D-Link 713 a good router, and it has a serial port, for a 
dial-up modem, but I only used mine for Ethernet/broadband.
It has a very accessible web interface, much more so than the D-Link 714P 
that I now have.
It is wireless, with 4 ports for cable, one being the line-in, and 3 out, or 
it was 4 out, but it seems like 3.

This is slightly off topic, but I am looking for opinions on which
wireless router to purchase.
