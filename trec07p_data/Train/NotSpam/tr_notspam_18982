It's really just the C-based languages.  Lots of popular languages don't

That had to be one of the main design considerations for Perl 1, but now
we've got the "design capital" to fix some things.  The Perl 6 mandate
is not universal compatibility (which Perl 5 still represents in a
way), but the chance to fix everything that needs fixing.  And this
one of the things I think C got wrong.  Perl 6 is looking more for
semantic and pragmatic compatibility than syntactic compatibility.
We won't have to teach anyone the *idea* of a conditional operator,
just send them off to look for the green bikeshed.

Certainly, all other things being equal (give or take), we'll go
for something familiar.  And I'll say we even put a thumb on the
scales in favor of what Perl 5 programmers expect, now and again.
But sometimes it's still right to break something, and reduce the
level of compatibility concern down to just making sure they get
a good error message if they fall into old habits.  In that case
it means making something different enough that the old one can be
recognized and dealt with.  At some point you put the new wine into
new wine skins and throw the old ones out.

It's not really that common, compared to, say, assignment, which you'll note
we've pretty much left untouched, except for relaxing the requirement for
parens on the right side of list assignment.

I would like to think that "doing things well" is exactly the approach
we're taking.  We're not optimizing for the past, but for the future.
This might rehuffmanization of everything might influence more
generations of computer language than we can possibly imagine.

: That may be eased by sprinkling familiar ideas amongst the novel.

Which we do quite liberally...  :)

Certainly.  The main problem is not so much that ? is ambiguous,
but that the : is.  It's somewhat ambiguous with labels
(though arguably those don't generally occur in the same context).
The killer is that it's formally ambiguous with the colon that is
used to indicate the list of an unparenthesized method call (in either
direct or indirect form).  That colon occurs where an infix is expected.
It's also ambiguous with adverbs, which can occur in that position
when modifying a preceding operator, as in 1..100:by(3).  The fact that
?: tends to be used as one term in an expression means that things tend
to be written compactly without spacing, which amplifies that ambiguity.

On the plus side, the fact that it's the : and not the ? that is most
problematic means that (unless the user adds their own infix:<?>) it's
pretty easy to recognize the old usage and give a good error message at
compile time.  And I think that's all that's really necessary here.
It's the differences that silently produce an unexpected result
that we'll really need to worry about in terms of user satisfaction
and FAQ minimization.  That's also why there's no infix:<.>, so at
least we can catch attempts to concatenate strings if they use spaces
around it.  For the rest, the fact that "foo"."bar" is unlikely to a
find a .bar method on strings will have to suffice.  Of course, if the
"method" is nonalphanumeric, we're even less likely to find the method.
And in the alphanumeric case, we can probably also alert on the fact
that writing ."bar" is in fact a useless use of quotes.

These are the everyday worries of a language designer.  Well, me anyway...
