Notes in the README.Debian and any relevant docs directory would help. 
A copy of their email would also be useful in there. This sort of thing 
would actually be useful in DWN. "$foo data relicensed to GPL" 

If the project is relatively fast moving and vdrift is
in etch, it might be a good idea to package it with the tarball updated
to reflect the licence change for etch r1 whenever that occurs and ask
for it to be put into stable-proposed-updates. This would cover all 
bases: anyone who had got vdrift from r0 would be made aware: anyone
who installed from r1 onwards would automatically get the changed 
licence terms.

Any lenny / sid package would just be packaged with the new licence.

I don't think that's adequate, unfortunately. What if I install from 
CD and have no 'Net access?
