You can't validate any complex software package, i.e. computer programming=
=20
language complexity (SAS, R, S-PLUS, SPSS, PERL, Python, Ruby, Java....)

You can qualify a software package, and validate code written in it.

As a "statistician" in a very large pharmaceutical company based in Basel=20
which happens to be bigger than the other large pharma in Basel, I can say=
=20
that we should have most of the paperwork done for qualification, at some=20
point this year, for use as part of submission packages.  Whether it will b=
e=20
used is another matter, which will be driven by business needs :-).

So your colleague is right, only in the sense that whatever the company has=
=20
approved is appropriate, and qualification in the "computer systems=20
validation" context is expensive, time and man-power wise.  But that holds=
=20
true for any software package.

Your colleague should have technically said:  "As R is not a qualified=20
software package at my company, we would like to ask if it would be possibl=
e=20
for you to use software which my company has approved and done=20
the /risk-management/ paperwork for and gotten approval from our Clinical=20
Quality group to use".=20

This is an issue -- however, whether R could pass that is not an issue, it=
=20
clearly could be done if they wanted to do it.
=20
best,
