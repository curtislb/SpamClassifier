The question is, if there is a significant difference in the two groups and how large the differnce is (95% confidence intervals).

Don't even consider this

This is not optimal

Using t0 as a covariate is the way to go.  A question is whether to just 
use t4.  Generally this is not optimum.

It's not obvious that random effects are needed if you take the 
correlation into account in a good way.  Generalized least squares using 
for example an AR1 correlation structure (and there are many others) is 
something I often prefer.  A detailed case study with R code (similar to 
your situation) is in http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/FrankHarrellGLS . 
  This includes details about why t0 is best to consider as a covariate. 
  One reason is that the t0 effect may not be linear.

If you want to focus on t4 it is easy to specify a contrast (after 
fitting is completed) that tests t4.  If time is continuous this 
contrast would involve predicted values at the 4th time, otherwise 
testing single parameters.
