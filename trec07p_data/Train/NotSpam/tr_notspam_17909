Cost might have something to do with it.
One can get a decent router for 30 bucks, and it is a lot easier to 
maintain.
Just my take on it.

How come people don't just use their Linux box as the router and a wireless
switch to provide the wireless?  I don't have a lot of experience in this
area so let me know if I am completely off.

I like the wrt54gl (I think that's what it's called, the current one
that runs linux not the current one that runs vxworks)

personally quite happy with my Cisco 2514 though...

I don't know why, but first C programs tend to look a lot worse than
first programs in any other language (maybe except for fortran, but then
I suspect all fortran programs look like `firsts')
