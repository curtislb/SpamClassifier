Just in case Love suddenly get's inspired by all of this - rather than
requiring a specific process model, I would like to see just a socket
descriptor and a function to process the server side so that I can use
it with existing muxer code. I don't want to crap up my process table
with daemons. Also, the IPC should be well defined and simple so that
I can go that low if I want.
