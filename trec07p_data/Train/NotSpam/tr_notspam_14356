Lou Dobbs Tonight
Wednesday, May 23, 2007

Tonight, the third deadliest month for U.S. troops in the war
so far, and the deadliest month since November 2004. We'll have
full coverage.

Communist China is whitewashing its reputation for substandard
products. Suddenly concerned about the safety of its exports,
Chinese authorities say they will crack down on safety
standards and inspections of toys it exports to the U.S. A new
report found twenty percent of toys and baby clothes made in
China are substandard and potentially hazardous to children.
And, a Communist Chinese consumer safety watchdog found some
toys were stuffed with garbage and contained bacteria and
viruses. We’ll have a full report.

For America’s middle class, their most valuable asset is
rapidly depreciating. Home prices declined over the past 12
months for the first time in nearly two decades, according to a
report released today. And, most investors believe that
prospects for a quick recovery are poor. Homeowners in Detroit,
Phoenix, San Diego and Las Vegas saw dramatic drops in the
value of their homes in the past year. But there’s better news
for Portland, Chicago, Seattle and Charlotte where prices at
least held steady. Join us tonight, we’ll have full coverage.

Union leaders are outraged over the Senate’s amnesty
legislation. Critics say the bill will increasing the number of
visas granted to foreign high tech workers will virtually
eliminate incentives for college students to pursue degrees in
math and science. According to the U.S. Department of
Education, U.S. colleges and universities graduate more than
300,000 students with these degrees. We’ll have a special
report on how rapidly that number may decline.

Catholic leaders are delivering petitions to California Senator
Dianne Feinstein’s office today in an effort to encourage the
Senator to support the Senate’s amnesty agenda.  We’ll have a
full investigation on how religious leaders are meddling in
U.S. immigration policy.

Critics of the Senate’s immigration bill are concerned that
current proposals for Z-visas gives reward and privileges
people living in this country illegally that legal immigrants
are denied. We’ll have a full report.

The President of the Family Research Council, Tony Perkins, is
taking issue with this program, saying Lou Dobbs is challenging
the First Amendment rights of religious leaders who speak out
on issues such as illegal immigration. He's our guest.

And, three of the nation's best radio talk show hosts: Steve
Cochran, WGN in Chicago, Mark Simone, WABC in New York, and
Wilmer Leon, XM Satellite radio in Washington join Lou.

latest commentary on how our leaders’ new immigration plans
ignores history’s lessons.

Lou Dobbs lays out his manifesto to save the middle class in
his new book, “War on the Middle Class: How the Government, Big
Business, and Special Interest Groups Are Waging War on the
American Dream and How to Fight Back.” War on the Middle Class
is now on sale in bookstores near you and on Amazon.com and
BarnesandNoble.com.
