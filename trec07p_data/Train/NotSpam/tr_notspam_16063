Ad hominem attack: Check.  (For what it's worth, I am an upstream
maintainer of one package in Debian (ircd-ircu) and another GPL'ed
software package that is not.  I am not inclined to adopt the
obviously orphaned ircd-ircu package just to satisfy people who look
at credentials over facts.)

Blatant and proud ignorance of the field: Check, check and check.  (I
am not a lawyer.  Under US law, I am not required to declare that when
I make legal commentary.  As a rule, I do not offer legal advice to
anyone, since I do not wish to practice law.)

Totally missing the point: Check.  (Choice of venue is for civil
cases.  Extradition is for criminal cases.  Your attempt to link the
two is irrelevant to whether choice of venue is free.)

I was -- and am -- in no mood to repeat the full reasons for these
positions for the fourth or fifth time.  If you cannot bother to read
the archives, that is your loss.

I said it was a summary and that it had been discussed on -legal
before.  Citations are available in the archives.

In the paragraph above, except for the last sentence (which has been
supported by others in this thread), the data are also from my
personal experience of being sued in a California federal court while
I was a resident of Virginia.  That experience is a major reason that
I am so adamantly against this kind of clause in licenses for free
software.

Debian's global activities do not in general affect jurisidiction over
individuals, so (4) primarily applies to Debian rather than its
developers or end users.

Nitpick: The plaintiff would need to issue a summons to the defendant.
A subpoena is for testimony or other fact discovery[1].  A defendant
does not become a respondent until he responds to a particular
filing[1]; the plaintiff would usually also be a respondent to certain
motions[1].

[1]- Ask Wikipedia, Google, or whatever floats your boat.  These are
not obscure legal facts or specific instances, they are basic terms.
Would you take someone seriously who had strong programming opinions
but thought "CC" was the name of a C compiler or claimed to know the
Pearl _scripting_ language?

I am aware that CDDL provides for that, but that is separate from
choice of venue.

How many free software licenses have been enforced thanks to choice of
venue?  gpl-violations.org seems to be doing quite well without one,
and I imagine that a choice of venue for Linux kernel litigation (to
any non-German venue) would have impaired that.

The first line of license enforcement for free software has been and
probably always be social pressure.  As has been frequently argued,
high-profile prospective defendants are likely to have legal presence
in most of the places that plaintiffs would like to sue anyway.  This
makes a choice of venue most applicable to low-profile defendants.

Not all "drawbacks" are "shifted costs".  The effect of choice of
venue is to shift a significant potential cost from the software
licensor to the software's users.  That is the reason that many of us
look at it as a fee or cost, and why we think it is a violation of
free software principles.
