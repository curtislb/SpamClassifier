I have consulted A.J. Miller's Subset Selection in Regression(1990), and I
found what I was talking about adjusted R^2 was exactly as you
said--Fisher's A-statisitc. The formula of adjusted R^2 without the
intercept in that book was also the same as what summary(lm)$adj.r.squared
does in R. I guess what you want me to derive is the formula in that book.

Though I know the formula of adjusted R2 for non-central moments, I still
want to know whether I am in the right way to compare *linear models with
intercept and those without intercept using maximizing adjs R^2 strategy.*
**
 Actually, I consider the left column consisted of all 1 in predictor matrix
Z as the intercept term. Then I apply maximizing adjs R^2 strategy to decide
which variables to select. Z is the term in the model: Y=Zb+e.

Thanks for your suggestion, and I am looking forward for your reply.
