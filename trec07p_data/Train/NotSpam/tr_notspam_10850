[0]BlueOni0n writes "Earlier today, Microsoft announced it will begin
[1]actively seeking reparations for [2]claimed patent infringement by
Linux and the open source community in general. One opinion on why
Microsoft won't reveal these 235 alleged IP infringements to the public
is that they're [3]afraid of having the claims debunked or challenged —
so instead they're waiting until the OS community comes to the bargaining
table. But a more optimistic thought is that Microsoft may be afraid to
list these supposed violations because it knows [4]the patents can be
worked around by the open source community, leaving Microsoft high and
dry without any leverage at all."

An anonymous reader writes "Compared to an operating-system-level
virtualization technology like OpenVZ, Xen — a hypervisor-level
virtualization technology that allows multiple operating systems to be
run with and without para-virtualization — trades off performance for
much better isolation and security. OpenVZ's performance advantage due to
running virtual containers in a single operating system kernel can be
significant. [0]A performance evaluation study (PDF) done by researchers
at the University of Michigan and HP labs provides insight into how big a
performance penalty Zen pays and what causes the overheads (primarily L2
cache misses)." From the report: "We compare both technologies with a
base system in terms of application performance, resource consumption,
scalability, low-level system metrics like cache misses and
virtualization-specific metrics like Domain-0 consumption in Xen. Our
experiments indicate that the average response time can increase by over
400% in Xen and only a modest 100% in OpenVZ as the number of application
instances grows from one to four... A similar trend is observed in CPU
consumptions of virtual containers."

[0]theodp writes "Faced with a duly unimpressed USPTO examiner who
rejected its new 1-Click patent claims as [1]'obvious' and 'old and well
known,' Amazon has taken the unusual step of [2]requesting an Oral Appeal
to plead its case. And in what might be interpreted by some as an
old-fashioned stalling tactic, the e-tailer has also [3]canceled and
refiled its 1-Click claims in a continuation application. As it [4]touted
the novelty of 1-Click to Congress last spring, Amazon kept the
examiner's rejection under its hat, insisting that 'still no [1-Click]
prior art has surfaced.' The Judiciary Committee hearing this testimony
included Rick Boucher (VA) and Howard Berman (CA), both [5]recipients of
campaign contributions from a [6]PAC funded by 1-Click inventor Jeff
Bezos, other Amazon execs, and their families."

the Copyright Board of Canada's decision last week on the controversial
private copying levy, which functions like a tax on blank media. The good
news? The Board [0]reduced the levy on certain media such as CD-R Audio,
CD-RW Audio, and MiniDiscs. The bad news? The millions of dollars in
overpayment from these media [1]will go into the pockets of
manufacturers, importers, and retailers, not back to the consumers who
paid in the first place. 'In addition to the overpayment issue, the
decision contains several interesting revelations ... the decision sheds
some light on the CPCC's enforcement program. The collective has
aggressively targeted those parties that do not pay the levy, with 21
claims over the past three years. In fact, the enforcement program has
been so effective that the Board found that concerns about the emergence
of a gray or black market for blank CDs has not materialized.'"

software in some circumstances, expand the DMCA with civil asset
forfeiture, and authorize wiretaps in investigations of Americans who are
'attempting' to infringe copyrights. Does this go too far?"

An anonymous reader passed us a link to an article on the Boston Globe's
website, talking up efforts by MIT to make [0]programming a
non-threatening part of grade-school education. MIT has developed a new
programming language designed to encourage experimentation and play.
Called [1]Scratch, the project eschews manuals and high-level concepts in
favour of approachability. "Efforts to make computer programming
accessible to young people began in the late 1970s with the advent of the
personal PC, when another programming language with roots at MIT — Logo —
allowed young people to draw shapes by steering a turtle around a screen
by typing out commands. But the path to mastering most programming
languages has been strewn with obstacles, since students needed to figure
out not only the underlying logic but also master a brand new syntax,
observe strict rules about semicolons and bracket use, and figure out
what was causing error messages even as they learned the program."

May 15th marks the [0]40 year anniversary of the first games hooked up to
the television. An article on the 1up site tells the story of Ralph Baer,
Bill Harrison, and Bill Rusch working at the Sanders Associates company
on a little game called Pong. They go into a great deal of detail on the
development of the console, going so far as to include a number of the
group's original notes on the project. "Baer kept the tiny lab, a former
company library in Sanders' early days, locked at all times. Only two men
had keys: Baer and Harrison. The room would remain the base of operations
for their controversial video experiments for years to come --
experiments that, had they been known about widely at the time, might
have garnered intense ridicule from other employees of the prominent
defense contractor. Pursuing them was an utterly audacious move."

overshoot writes "Anyone remember [0]The Clueless Newbie's Linux Odyssey?
As it happens, she's come back to [1]have a go at Ubuntu Feisty. 'Four
years ago I tried about a dozen Linux distributions, to see if they were
ready for an ordinary user to install as an escape from the Windows
world. None of the distros performed well enough for me to recommend them
to a non-geek unless they were going to hire someone to install it. After
hearing Dell's recent announcement that it will sell computers with
pre-installed Ubuntu Linux, I decided to see if Ubuntu was
user-friendly.'"

causes for concern. Very few details have emerged so far so it is not
completely clear what impact Dell with have on the thriving Ubuntu

pricing, and a number of other areas that are affected. From the article:
'Dell is in the practice of filling their computers with large amounts of
"bloatware" and also all sorts of co-branding, but it remains to be seen
what they will do with Ubuntu. It has been reported that Dell will be
shipping a standard version of Ubuntu 7.04...'"

Microsoft offering has a solid presence in Latin America. The company is
no longer trying very hard to market it here at home.

An anonymous reader sends along a posting from the Grooveking blog on a
group of Stanford students who [0]got together to help promote Firefox
and ended up releasing a long overdue [1]eBay Toolbar for Firefox before
Mozilla and eBay could release their [2]jointly developed extension in
Europe. Mozilla's COO said the preemptive release of the eBay Toolbar had
ruffled some feathers among European eBay execs. "Besides basic search
features, it removes external ads on the site and allows users to see
thumbnail pictures on ALL search items, even those sellers didn't pay
for. An eBay toolbar has been long overdue... eBay can't be too
enthusiastic about this toolbar since it cuts directly into its main
sources of revenue: ads and thumbnail fees. But eBay users get a really
good deal."

An anonymous reader writes "Linus Torvalds [0]has a sharp retort to
Microsoft executives' statements in a [1]Fortune article that Linux
violates 235 Microsoft patents. In an emailed response to
InformationWeek's Charlie Babcock, Torvalds writes: 'It's certainly a lot
more likely that Microsoft violates patents than Linux does.' He added:
'Basic operating system theory was pretty much done by the end of the
1960s. IBM probably owned thousand of really "fundamental" patents... The
fundamental stuff... has long, long since lost any patent protection.'"
Torvalds also commented on Microsoft's [2]stated intention not to sue
Linux users: "They'd have to name the patents then, and they're probably
happier with the FUD than with any lawsuit."

First Word is quoted on why they didn't DRM the download: "Making a
legal, paid-for version of the file less useful than a copied or pirated

xzvf sends us a link to a BusinessWeek report on the campaign of two US
senators to [0]get answers to how H-1B work visas are actually being used.
Yesterday Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Richard Durbin (D-IL) sent
[1]a letter (PDF) to nine Indian outsourcing firms that, among them,
snapped up 30% of the H-1B visas issued last year. The senators want to
know, among other things, whether the H-1B program is being used to
enable the offshoring of American jobs. "Critics say outsourcing firms,
including Infosys Technologies and Wipro, are using the visas to replace
US employees with foreign workers, often cycling overseas staff through
US training programs before sending them back into jobs at home."

Reader Hanji alerts us to a hack pulled off when Randall Munroe, author
of the popular webcomic [0]XKCD, spoke at MIT by invitation of the Lab
for Computer Science. MIT hackers dropped [1]hundreds of labelled playpen
balls onto the audience from hatches in the ceiling. The labels bore
XKCD's logo as well as the recently discovered 16-byte AACS processing
key. At another point in Munroe's talk he was stalked by
remote-controlled mechanical velociraptors; but fortunately he had been
supplied with a squirt gun full of grape juice.
