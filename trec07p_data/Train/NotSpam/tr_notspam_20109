      Sounds like SpeakUp is not really a module, but a reworking of the
kernel.  If SpeakUp were implemented more as a module...can't modules be
loaded from the lilo/grub boot prompt?  If so, then it could be included
as a kernel module, loaded at startup by those who need it...I really
need to see the code. <sighs>  I'm thinking if it were a module that 
simply works with the kernal, there'd be less resistance to adding it to 
the source.  Does the kernal support dual monitors?  It could possibly 
be implemented in a similar manner...if Linus already has implemented 
something similar.  Just follow his example...use his own code against 
him, in a manner of speaking. <grins>  We could also get him really, 
really drunk and tell him that he was the one who wrote it.  I could 
also threaten to marry his sister?  It would be worth it.

         Michael
