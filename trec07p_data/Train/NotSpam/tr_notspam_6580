Thanks to Rep. Tom Allen (D-ME) for circulating
the public health objectives for trade
agreements, and calling attention to their
relevance for intellectual property provisions of
pending agreements with Peru, Colombia, Panama
and South Korea.  - Ellen Shaffer

>Dear Colleague:
>
>             The issue of intellectual property
> (IP) rules on medicines in trade agreements is
> receiving increased attention.  The new trade
> policy unveiled by Chairmen Rangel and Levin
> calls for re-establishing "a fair balance
> between promoting access to medicines in
> developing countries and protecting pharmaceutical innovation."
>
>             Congress may soon vote on free
> trade agreements with Peru, Colombia, Panama
> and South Korea, all of which impose stringent
> IP rules.  These rules can limit the
> affordability of needed medicines by
> restricting the availability of less expensive
> generic alternatives.  Provisions in these
> agreements may also provide a basis for
> altering domestic U.S. health care laws and policies.
>
>             A coalition of public health

> Advisory Committee on Trade, has proposed a set
> of public health objectives for international

>Public Health and Global Trade: Findings
>
>
>Global and bilateral trade negotiations present
>important opportunities to promote a healthy,
>safe and just global community.  However,
>current U.S. trade policies have contributed to
>social and economic inequality, both within the
>U.S. and among our trading partners, factors
>strongly associated with poor health outcomes.
>Trade agreements provide a basis for altering
>domestic U.S. laws and policies that protect the
>public's health and access to health care and medicines.
>
>
>
>Federal legislation mandates that the United
>States Trade Representative receive domestic
>input into trade negotiations from interested
>parties outside the federal government.  There
>have been limited opportunities for public
>health advice in reviewing trade policies, and
>as a result trade negotiations do not reflect a public health perspective.
>
>
>
>Federal law also mandates Congressional
>oversight of U.S. global trade
>negotiations.  Presidential Trade Promotion
>Authority undermines Congressional oversight and
>has limited Congress' ability to ensure that
>trade agreements promote social and economic equity.
>
>We urge Congress and the U.S. Trade
>Representative (USTR) to adopt the following
>enforceable Public Health Objectives, as a basis
>for amending pending trade agreements and to
>guide any future agreements, and to initiate a
>review of bilateral, regional and multilateral
>agreements for their adherence to public health principles.
>
>
>Public Health Objectives for Global Trade
>
>
>
>1.      To assure democratic participation by
>public health and transparency in trade policy by:
>
>a.      Appointing to all relevant trade
>advisory committees representatives of
>organizations that work to assure equitable
>access to affordable health-related services and
>products, and promote the health of individuals, communities and populations,
>
>b.      Opening all proceedings and documents of
>trade advisory committees to the public, and
>
>c.      Requiring USTR's consultation with all
>relevant committees of the House and Senate in
>the development, implementation, and
>administration of U.S. trade policy, without
>renewing presidential trade promotion authority.
>2.      To develop mutually beneficial trade
>relationships that create sustainable economic
>development for the U.S. and our trade partners
>in an increasingly interdependent world.
>3.      To recognize the legitimate exercise of
>national, regional and local government
>sovereignty to protect population health, and to
>ensure that countries do not weaken or reduce,
>as an encouragement for trade, sound policies
>that contribute to health and well being,
>including laws on public health, the environ­ment and labor.
>4.      To exclude tariff and nontariff
>provisions in trade agreements that address
>vital human services such as health care, water
>supply and sanitation, food safety and supply,
>and education, including licensing and
>cross-border movement of personnel in these fields.
>5.      To exclude tobacco and tobacco products,
>which are lethal, and for which the public
>health goal is to reduce consumption, from
>tariff and nontariff provisions of trade
>agreements, including advertising, labeling,
>product regulation and distribution.
>6.      To exclude alcohol products, which
>present serious hazards to public health.
>Policies designed to reduce the harm caused by
>alcohol products should not be subject to
>compromise in exchange for other trade benefits.
>
>7.      To eliminate intellectual property
>provisions related to pharmaceuticals from
>bilateral and regional negotiations, as these
>are more appropriately addressed in multilateral
>fora, and promote trade provisions which enable
>countries to exercise all flexibilities provided
>by the Doha Declaration on Public Health,
>including issuing compulsory licenses for
>patented pharmaceuticals, parallel importation,
>and other measures that address high prices and
>promote access to affordable medicines.
