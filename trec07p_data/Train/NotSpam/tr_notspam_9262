I know. But I am curious about how sample() works.

For a small sample size. choose 1 digit from 0, 1
it only has two combinations. It is easy to test that the below can happen
consecutively.

> sample (c(0,1), 1)
[1] 0
> sample (c(0,1), 1)
[1] 0

That means, the output did not deplete all unique combinations before
repeating.

So I am concerned about how to control this. What I like to see after
the control is:
> sample (c(0,1), 1)
[1] 0
> sample (c(0,1), 1)
[1] 1
> sample (c(0,1), 1)
[1] 0

I don't think that is possible. Anyway, I just think a way to control is
recording all output in files, checking the new output, if they are
repeating with any of the previous files, then do not use it.
That is kind of clumsy. For each new combination, I have to compare with all
previous combinations.

First I sort the sequence, then I do a difference. then I square it, then I
sum it. If the result is 0 then a repetition happens.


Thanks all.
