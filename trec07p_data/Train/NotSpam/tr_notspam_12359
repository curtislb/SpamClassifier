The Copyright Alliance--which launched, complete with electric-green and
white T-shirts displaying its logo at a morning Capitol Hill event
here--consists of 29 national organizations and companies that purport
to represent 11 million workers in copyright-related industries. Those
members include the Recording Industry Association of America, the
Association of American Publishers, the Motion Picture Association of
America, Microsoft, Viacom and Walt Disney.
........

But according to a press release, they're all committed to broad goals
like promoting the "vital role" of copyright in the U.S. economy and job
market, encouraging inclusion of copyright protection requirements in
international agreements, supporting civil and criminal penalties for
piracy, and advocating against "diminishment" of copyright law.

...

 The Copyright Alliance's message, however, is not without competition.
October marked the launch of a Washington-based alliance, called the
Digital Freedom Campaign, whose members include the Consumer Electronics
Association, advocacy group Public Knowledge, and the Electronic
Frontier Foundation.

That group argues that big labels and studios are threatening to squelch
new gadgets and consumer freedom by chipping away at the fair use rights
written into copyright law. They support proposals like the Fair Use
Act, sponsored by Rep. Rick Boucher (D-Va.) and three of his House
colleagues, which would amend the controversial Digital Millennium
Copyright Act to allow consumers the legal right to pick digital locks
on copyrighted works for certain home or educational purposes.
