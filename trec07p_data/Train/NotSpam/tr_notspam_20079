Dmesg can also be very enlightening when determining the hardware in a
system. If you are using a kernel that came with your distribution,
then chances are good that most, if not all of the support for your
hardware is built as modules, and isn't statically built into the kernel.

Actually, if you have an ide burner, and are running a 2.6.x kernel,
then you don't need ide-scsi emulation for cd burning either.
