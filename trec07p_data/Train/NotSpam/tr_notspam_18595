5:50 PM, 6/12/07, Update: False fire alarm prompts quick action=20

Fire alarms tripped inside the Russian section of the international space s=
tation today, triggering emergency procedures and concern on the ground unt=
il the astronauts reported it was an apparent false alarm.

At 5:20 p.m., alarm tones could be heard on air-to-ground radio, prompting =
U.S. flight controllers to ask for a status report.

"We see the warning message, just looking for a status from you all," astro=
naut Megan McArthur radioed from Houston.

"Yeah, stand by, we have on the PCS (station computer system) right now say=
s 'fire FGB,'" said Expedition 15 flight engineer Sunita Williams. "But sta=
nd by."

The FGB is also known as the Russian Zarya module, which sits between the U=
.S. Unity module and the Russian Zvezda command module. Expedition 15 comma=
nder Fyodor Yurchikhin, flight engineer Oleg Kotov and Williams immediately=
 began working through emergency procedures.

Moments later, astronaut Clay Anderson, Williams' replacement, called Houst=
on to say the crew had "looked around, we smelled around" and there was no =
sign of any smoke or fire.

"ISS, we copy," McArthur said. "No evidence of visible smoke or fire and yo=
u think all is normal but you're still checking. We're standing by."
=20
"We're working some recovery steps," Anderson said. "But it appears to be a=
 software glitch. There is no fire."

A few moments later, Russian flight controllers agreed it was a false alarm.
