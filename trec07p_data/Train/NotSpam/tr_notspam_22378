Hi Tom,

Thanks for the response.

Not sure where to plug in this BEGIN {}...

It looks like Net::Netrc is working:
# perl -MNet::Netrc -lwe 'print join(" ",
Net::Netrc->lookup("MyCpanMirror")->lpa)'
Use of uninitialized value in join or string at -e line 1.
cpan XpasswdX 

I've also tested Net::FTP separately, and it works as advertised with
.netrc.

As it turns out, if I wait patiently for all the LWP/Net::FTP timeouts,
eventually CPAN resorts to /usr/bin/ftp which does read my .netrc. My
modules do eventually get installed but not w/o several admonitions that
using /usr/bin/ftp may cause "...problems that are hard to diagnose"

I'm not sure where else to go with this. It looks like I can eventually
get what I need installed, but not without a long bumpy ride first.

Thanks for the feedback.
