About Prize4Life

“His latest idea is to offer $10 million [in] prize[s], ‘Prize4Life,’
to create buzz and attract researchers to solve the puzzles of ALS,
much as the X Prize stimulated private teams to build a
spacecraft . . . It is all about harnessing market forces to his
goal, Mr. Kremer says.”

– The Wall Street Journal

What is Prize4Life?

Prize4Life is a results-oriented nonprofit founded to accelerate ALS/
MND research by offering substantial prizes to scientists who solve
the most critical scientific problems preventing the discovery of an
effective ALS/MND treatment.

The Prize4Life concept is inspired by other prize awards for
stimulating research, such as the X-Prize for commercial space travel
and DNA-decoding, the U.S. government’s H-Prize for hydrogen
renewable energy, and Eli Lilly’s venture, InnoCentive, which
outsources difficult R&D problems to a distributed network of
scientists using prizes.

Why launch prizes for ALS/MND research?

*  Prizes will act as a “lighthouse” for all of ALS/MND research –
directing scientists to focus on solving the ALS problems most
critical to discovering an effective treatment.
*  Prizes will provide the right incentives for the right academic
ideas to be taken outside of the laboratory and commercialized for
ALS/MND patients.
*  Prizes will remove the largest impediments to industry’s
involvement in ALS/MND.

What makes Prize4Life distinctive?

*  Prize4Life only pays for results - the results that ALS/MND
patients desperately need.

*  Prize4Life is uniquely positioned to offer ALS/MND prizes because
we bring together existing ALS nonprofits, academia, and industry –
all working toward an ALS/MND treatment.

What will we offer prizes for?

1) Biomarker/diagnostic tool:  a test or exam that will allow us to
measure how good a potential ALS/MND treatment is much more precisely
than just measuring patient survival.

2) High Throughput Screening for ALS/MND:  a lab experiment that
allows the fast and cheap testing of large numbers of chemical
compounds for their potential as ALS/MND drugs.

3) New Treatment Therapies:  new drugs that extend the life of ALS/
MND patients by significantly compared to the current standard ALS/
MND therapy.

Prize4Life, Inc. is incorporated in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
and is seeking 501(c)3 nonprofit tax status.
