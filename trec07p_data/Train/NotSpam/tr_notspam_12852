			<p class="storytext"><a href="/photoessay/0,4644,1771,00.html" target="_new">Check out the pictures that I've posted today!</a> We are at the <a href="javascript:siteSearch('Reagan Library');"><b>Reagan Library</b></a> in California and took a number of pics for you. My favorite two pics are the ones of the chunk of the <a href="javascript:siteSearch('Berlin Wall');"><b>Berlin Wall</b></a> in the back of the library. The chunk of the wall was donated to the Presidential Library because President Reagan was instrumental in that wall coming down. On the west side of the wall you see bright colors… and the east side? Well, click on the pics and see for yourself. There is no doubt a clash of cultures is shown by the two sides.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">This morning we are interviewing <a href="javascript:siteSearch('Secretary Rice');"><b>Secretary Rice</b></a> at the library so you can expect more pics on Friday (tomorrow — Thursday — I hope to be home sleeping in my own bed instead of writing an early blog since I intend to take the redeye back to the East Coast tonight. This, of course, means I get home about 6 a.m. on Thursday, go home and sleep a few hours and then I will be in the D.C. bureau for our show with little time to write a blog or post pics.)</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Whether you are a Republican or a Democrat (or something else), you would love the Reagan Library. It is a piece of history and history is fascinating. We have now traveled to four presidential libraries and each is so different from the other.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Tonight's show airs from Los Angeles. I am not exactly sure where we are doing the show since I am told that the L.A. bureau resources are all being dispatched to "American Idol" (owned by the same parent company as FNC.) We are renting a studio some place... and after the show, as noted above, going to LAX and boarding a plane (the redeye) to the East Coast.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Now for some of your e-mails:</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext"><strong>E-mail No. 1</strong></p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Hi Greta,<br />
Why did your cameraman focus on you and the man who was giving you the tour of the Reagan library? I would have loved to see some of the things you were talking about.<br />
Thanks,<br />
<em>Cheryl S.</em></p> 
		
			<p class="storytext"><strong>E-mail No. 2</strong></p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Hi Greta:<br />
Who would I like to see you interview? Well, I am pulling this off the top of my head and maybe you have already interviewed them, but I would enjoy you talking to Dr. Rice and Gen. Powell — two extraordinary people to be sure.<br />
Or out of the political arena how about an astronaut who has been to space? A Blue Angel or Thunderbird pilot perhaps? A musician, maybe Joan Baez? She has the most beautiful voice that I can think of.<br />
Now, someone you can no longer interview but that I would have not missed for the world is President Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. Speaking of which, how about Tony Blair?<br />
I am sure as soon as I press send I will think of someone else… on a different note, I leave next week for Three Rivers, TX for an outage at a Valero refinery there.<br />
I know you are interested in knowing that…<br />
All the best,<br />
<em>Jeff</em></p>

Pam has to give up the dog? That is SO wrong! I bet her heart is broken. She is looking great though! Please keep having Sarah Baxter on the show. She is articulate and restrained and always interesting.<br />
Who would I like to see you interview? Adam Levine of Maroon 5.<br />
By the way, I saw your name mentioned in Page Six yesterday. When are going to start selling WWGD (What Would Greta Do) bracelets on your Web site?<br />
The tour of the Reagan Library was fantastic.<br />
Have a great night.<br />

Ronald Reagan is certainly one of the most inspiring and influential men to ever grace this Earth. To learn that his diaries have been published is overwhelming and great news. And yes, I just purchased a copy on Amazon!<br />
One of your finest hours, and I thank you!<br />

			<p class="storytext">Dear Greta,<br />
I love your segments on animals! I'm sorry that she has to part with the St. Bernard that she rescued and has fallen in love with. I know I tend to get very attached to pets quickly. Last month I rescued a stray cat who was sick and got him into our Richmond City Shelter for medical attention. The Richmond City Shelter here in VA is now under new management and they are great to work with and take great medical care of their animals. I wanted to bring him home with me but we have no more room. Once he was all well I adopted him and placed him in a Cat Adoption Group where he was placed in a PetSmart. He was adopted very quickly to an owner who loves cat's and he now has a little brother and sister. What a great ending !<br />
