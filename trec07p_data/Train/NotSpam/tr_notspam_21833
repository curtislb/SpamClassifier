     I thought Bill Gates said that one, not IBM?  It's standard 
practice to hold back on things like partition sizes.  How else can you 
get people to upgrade their operating systems and buy new hardware? 
They keep increasing the internet's bandwidth, and the only people that 
really benefit are the spammers. <laughs>
