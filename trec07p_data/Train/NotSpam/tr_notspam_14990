Thanks for your reply Charles. I do indeed have other variables. I
apologize for being vague, here is my study in more detail:

I have a cohort of births. My outcome is a dichotomous variable for
presence/absence of a birth defect. For each cohort member I estimate
the date of conception, and assign a pollution level during the relevant
period of gestation. All cohort members conceived on the same day are
assigned the same pollution level. These cohort members also have a
covariate, t, which indicates the day of follow-up. For example, if the
first day of my study is Jan 1, 1987, the data would look like:

Date			t	Conceptions		Cases
Pollution	Stratum
Jan 1, 1987		1	100			1
10		1
Jan 2, 1987		2	105			0
8		2
Jan 3, 1987		3	101			1
11		3
.
.
Jan 1, 1988		366	109			1
13		1
Jan 2, 1988		367	111			2
19		2
Jan 3, 1988		368	103			0
14		3
.
.
.

I make matched pairs of days (Strata) to control for the influence of
season. I also want to account for long-term trends, eg increasing birth
defects ascertainment and decreasing pollution levels over time, so I
want to fit a cubic spline using the variable t. 

I have already analyzed this data as a time series (I don't use the
Stratum variable in the time-series analyses), but now I am exploring
some alternatives. My full dataset has 3,115 strata.

So my final model would look like: clogit(Cases/Conceptions ~ Pollution
+ f(t) + strata(Stratum)). 

So, just to reiterate, my goal is to make this model without having to
bring in the individual-level data. I would be just as happy to do a
conditional Poisson as I would be to do a conditional logistic
regression - either would seem to be appropriate here - if that opens up
some other options.

Thanks very much for your time and interest,

I think you have described the data for forming a 2 by 2 by K table of
counts.

In which case, loglin(), loglm(), mantelhaen.test(), and - if K is not
too large - glm(... , family=poisson)  would be suitable.

But you say 'models' above suggesting that there are some other
variables. If so, you need to be a bit more specific in describing your
setup.
