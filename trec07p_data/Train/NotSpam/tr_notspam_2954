OK, I think I begin to see your point and which is the question the
Debian Project has to answer: should people be allowed to use the
Official Use Logo on anything, as long as endorsement is not claimed?

I think I must stop for a while and wait for some opinions from DDs
(which I am not...), before going on with the proposed trademark license
text.
Also, a clarification by Nathanael on what he meant to achieve with his
original proposal would be useful: Nathanael, did you intend to allow or
forbid the above-outlined scenario?
