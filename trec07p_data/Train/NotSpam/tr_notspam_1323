Ah, *now* I see - sorry. I didn't get it. No, I don't have a file
like that - I haven't seen a wild pointer crash in the tdb code
itself for a long long time :-). I'm thinking of the somewhat
less robust code that is processing the tdb output data :-).

Although some rather woolley thinking on my part did rather
confuse the two :-).

I will test this code with the contents of /dev/random
though (prepended with a valid tdb header of course :-).

Jeremy.
