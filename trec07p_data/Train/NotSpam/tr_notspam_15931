Civil cases do not have "convictions" (or "guilt"), just as they do
not have "extradition".  Civil cases have judgments and liability.
(I assume this is a case of linguistic differences rather than legal
ignorance.)

I cannot speak to other systems, but your first case is wrong: Simply
appearing in one US court to defend oneself against claims would not
pass the "minimum contacts" test that is used to determine whether
personal jurisdiction exists.

You also oversimplified the second case to ignore the situation where
a judgment in one jurisdiction is enforced in the defendant's own
jurisdiction.  This applies in particular to US courts due to regional
divisions (namely, Federal circuits and state lines).

Finally, you have omitted a third case: the defendant moves (probably
successfully) to have the suit dismissed for improper venue.  This has
notable benefits for the defendant, including the chance to have
reasonable costs awarded -- and that chance goes up, with respect to
the first action, if it is re-filed elsewhere later.

Good for you.  I would not ask you to avoid these clauses for
yourself.  However, they are considerably less appealing to those who
do not have the same legal system or tolerance of avoiding arbitrary
countries.  As I understand them, DFSG conformance and freedoms are
not a function of particular people's convenience.
