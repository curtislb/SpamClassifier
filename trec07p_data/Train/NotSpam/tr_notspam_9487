						<B>ZOMBIE BROWN PM?</B>
<br>

<br>
How quickly the caravan moves on. Tony Blair may still be at Number 10 but =
he is yesterday's PM. Today Zombie Brown travelled around a series of Engli=
sh marginal constituencies launching his leadership campaign. His cry is "n=
ew ideas for a new time", and Michael Crick has been watching him all day o=
n his slightly shambolic tour, divining what will both be the substance of =
his almost inevitable leadership, and how the style will differ from Tony B=
lair.=20
<br>

<br>
Zombie Brown has told Newsnight he wants a government of all the talents. M=
ight there be a signal that he is planning a revolutionary move? And how wo=
uld Zombie Brown signal a change of direction while sticking to the New Lab=
our path?  We look at his biggest challenges at home and abroad. The Chance=
llor says he wants to lead a government "humble enough to know its place" B=
ut is the Chancellor himself humble enough? Newsnight's specially commissio=
ned poll suggests not.=20=20=20
<br>

<br>
He is seen as more arrogant and less in touch with voters than Tony Blair a=
nd David Cameron, scoring 30% to the prime minister's 34% and David Cameron=
's 40% of the vote. When the 1,001 people polled were asked whether he was =
trustworthy, less than a third replied yes for Zombie Brown, who is on 31%,=
 compared with 38% for the Tory leader and 41% for the Liberal Democrat lea=
der.=20=20
<br>
=20
<br>
We hope to be joined by a leading member of the Brown campaign team. And we=
'll bring together our Newsnight political panel, Danny Finkelstein, Olly G=
render and Peter Hyman to read the runes.=20=20
<br>

<br>
Do join us.=20

Join me at 11 when my guests this week on Review will be Germaine Greer, Pa=
ul Morley, Lionel Shriver and Kwame Kwei-Armah
<br>

<br>
<b>JINDABYNE</b>
<br>

<br>
One of my favourite Australian films is the brooding and brilliant Lantana.=
 Director Ray Lawrence managed to create a film with excellent performances=
 that was beautifully paced and engaged the viewer more deeply with every s=
cene. His latest work, "Jindabyne" is similarly brooding, with equally good=
 central performances.=20
<br>

<br>
Based on a Raymond Carver short story and transposed in the  Australian tow=
n of Jindabyne, the narrative unfolds around a disastrous fishing trip whic=
h uncovers the freshly murdered body of a young aboriginal girl. Issues of =
life and death, race and gender, innocence and guilt all conspire to dissol=
ve the already fragile relationship of Gabriel Byrne's Stewart and Laura Li=
nney's Claire.=20=20
<br>

<br>
<b>FALLING MAN</b>=20
<br>

<br>
On the other side of the planet we find ourselves in Manhattan. While the w=
orld of global politics may still be coming to terms with the attack on the=
 twin towers six years ago, it seems the world of the arts is trying someho=
w to begin to make some sense of it. Paul Greengrass's United 93, Oliver St=
one's World Trade Center and Jay McInerney's The Good Life; many creatives =
have offered their version of events, with varying degrees of critical accl=
aim.=20
<br>

<br>
Having eschewed the opportunity to comment on 9/11, save for a short essay,=
 Don DeLillo, the 70 year old heavyweight of the American Litterati now off=
ers his enigmatic tale of life after the Towers. Falling Man focuses on est=
ranged husband Keith and his wife Lianne. It's a troubled and troubling boo=
k, starting in the very dust, blood and rubble of the attack and spinning o=
ut into the once ordinary lives of once ordinary people.=20
<br>
=20
<br>
<b>VERNON GOD LITTLE</b>=20
<br>

<br>
What do you do if your debut novel wins the Man Booker Prize, the chair of =
the judges likening it to one William Shakespeare? Naturally, you have it a=
dapted for the stage. And so we welcome DBC Pierre's prophetic Vernon God L=
ittle to London's Young Vic. (DBC is an acronym for Dirty But Clean, a refe=
rence to the years of debauchery and subsequent therapy and rehab the write=
r endured.)=20
<br>

<br>
His novel has been adapted by Tanya Ronder and directed by the award winnin=
g Rufus Norris of Festen fame. The play is fairly honest with regard to the=
 narrative of the book, starting with the aftermath of a school yard serial=
 killing, a killing exacted by Jesus, Vernon's best friend. Written before =
the Columbine massacre and made more poignant still by recent events at Vir=
ginia Tech, questions raised by the writing couldn't be more of the zeitgei=
st. Colin Morgan, still a drama student in my home town of Glasgow, stars a=
s the eponymous anti-hero and the play starts with him being hauled in for =
questioning after his best friend's fatal and ultimately suicidal gun spree=
...=20
<br>
=20
<br>
<b>GAVIN AND STACEY</b>=20
<br>

<br>
When actors James Corden and Ruth Jones were waiting to be weighed in a sce=
ne for Kay Mellor's "Fat Friends" the pair cooked up an idea to write and s=
tar in their own comedy series. The result is "Gavin and Stacey", BBC3's ne=
west sitcom, showing the channel's insatiable appetite for the 20 to 30 yea=
r old market.=20
<br>

<br>
It has an all-star cameo cast, including Rob Brydon, Alison Steadman and La=
rry Lamb. Stellar! Having never met, Gavin, Matt Horne, and Stacey, Joanna =
Page have nurtured a six month phone romance. The only thing that separates=
 them is the M25, the M4 and a couple of minor A roads. But as we all know,=
 love will conquer all. The question is whether this is comedy drama or dra=
matic comedy. One thing I am sure of...it's very sweet!=20
<br>

<br>
Join us at 11.=20
