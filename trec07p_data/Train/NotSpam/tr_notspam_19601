If you're selling PCs as a business, YOU CAN'T say "go to debian.org" 
(or you might be able to but you're taking a massive risk!)

If I give a PC with Debian pre-installed to a friend, I can say "go to 
Debian.org" because I'm covered by the non-commercial bit.

But if you're a business, then YOU are liable to provide the source. If 
the download site goes away and you haven't made a copy, you're sunk. 
You have legal obligations and you can't meet them. You're in deep 
doodoo if someone calls you on them.

So you NEED to make a copy. And once you've done that, you might as well 
burn a CD/DVD for every PC you sell. If you do that, then when they come 
to you saying "I demand my copy of the source that the GPL says you have 
to give me", you can say "you got it with the PC. If you've lost it, 
tough luck". Not that I'd advise being that harsh to your customers, but 
at least you can legally say "shove off" without being in breach of the 
licence (good customer relations says you should say "okay, I'll burn 
you another copy" :-)

Cheers,
Wol
