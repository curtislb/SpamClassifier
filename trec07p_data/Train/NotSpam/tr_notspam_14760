Hello list. I know that you can use speakup in gentoo with a external 
synth, but, is there support using software speach? Guess it's really 
not needed as you can do most of it through ssh, but, figured I would 
ask. I did a search on google for software speach in gentoo and only 
found things from a few years ago. Either I did not search enough, 
or, it was not there. Any ideas would be great.
