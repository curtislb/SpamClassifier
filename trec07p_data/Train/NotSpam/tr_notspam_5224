Making news today...

* Eight Democratic Presidential Candidates head to South Carolina tonight for the SC Democratic Party's Path to the
Presidency 2008 Presidential Debate.

Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Chris Dodd, John Edwards, Mike Gravel, Dennis Kucinich, Barack Obama, and Bill Richardson
will participate in the 7 pm ET debate, hosted by South Carolina State University in Orangeburg, SC.

CNN's Political Ticker will provide constant real-time updates, campaign spin and reaction, and expert analysis
beginning at 7pm ET.

"The issues likely to come up" tonight "are familiar ones - the war in Iraq, healthcare, the economy, education. The
big difference in South Carolina is race, which overlays just about every policy discussion in the state, as it has
since Emancipation and reconstruction." (Los Angeles Times)

"For the few apparent front-runners, this and the debates that follow are fraught with the potential 'minefields' of
missteps and confrontations testing one against the other." (Chicago Tribune)

"Candidates will be trying to avoid an embarrassing episode that could damage or even sink their chances. In the first
presidential campaign of the online video era, a major debate gaffe can be magnified with devastating swiftness."
(Baltimore Sun)

AP asks, will Hillary Clinton "use her occasional Dixie drawl?"

Meanwhile, "the GOP will launch a major media offensive to counter the Democratic message coming from Orangeburg." (The
State)

* The House late Wednesday narrowly approved a bill funding the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq that sets a goal of
withdrawing U.S. combat forces from Iraq next year.

The final vote on the $124 billion funding bill was 218-208, with two members voting present. The tally was largely
along party lines, with just two Republicans voting for it and 13 Democrats voting against. (CNN.com)

Dems "hope to send the measure to the White House on Monday, almost exactly four years after President Bush declared an
end to major combat in a speech aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln. That would be a particularly pungent political
anniversary for Bush to deliver only the second veto of his presidency." (Washington Post)

Deputy White House Press Secretary Dana Perino said in a statement:

"Tonight, the House of Representatives voted for failure in Iraq – and the President will veto its bill."
(WhiteHouse.gov)

* On CNN's Larry King Live, a "disappointed" Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) spoke about Attorney General Alberto Gonzales'
performance:

KING: Now, did you say you think Gonzales should leave?

JOHN MCCAIN: I think out of loyalty to the president that -- that that would probably be the best thing that he could
do.

* And is Michael Bloomberg jumping on the Al Gore-for-prez bandwagon?  Find out the latest in Hot Topics below!

President's Schedule:

* The president and Mrs. Bush participate in a 10 am ET photo op with the 2007 National and State Teachers of the Year
in the Oval Office. President Bush will make remarks to the Teachers in the Rose Garden at 10:20 am ET.

Tonight, the president and Mrs. Bush participate in a Social Dinner with the Prime Minister of Japan and Mrs. Abe at
the White House at 7 pm ET.

Also on the Political Radar:

* President Bill Clinton "hits the kitchen" with Rachael Ray to talk about the issue of childhood obesity and how to
cook quick, affordable and healthy meals. http://www.rachaelrayshow.com/

* Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) takes his announcement tour to SC with a 9 am ET rally in Greenville, a 1 pm ET rally in
Columbia, and a 6 pm ET rally in Charleston.

* Mitt Romney holds a 9:40 am ET media avail in Hampton, NH, and meets with local residents in Stratham and Portsmouth.
At 12 pm ET, Romney keynotes the Portsmouth Rotary Luncheon. Later, Romney travels to Manhattan to keynote the Yeshiva
University Sy Syms School of Business Gala at 7:15 pm ET.

* Former VA Gov. Jim Gilmore officially announces as a candidate for President in a live 1 pm ET webcast from the
Republican Party of Iowa HQ in Des Moines. www.gilmoreforpresident.com

* Vice President Dick Cheney gives the commencement address at Brigham Young University in Provo, UT, at 6 pm ET.

"Demonstrations, both in support and in opposition to the war in Iraq, have marked Cheney's visit... BYU was expected
to be an overwhelmingly friendly host for Cheney, but the opposition and protests posed a challenge for the
university." (Salt Lake Tribune)

Political Hot Topics
(Today's top political stories from news organizations across the country)

HOUSE PASSES SPENDING BILL WITH WITHDRAWAL DEADLINE 218-208: The House last night brushed aside weeks of angry White
House rhetoric and veto threats to narrowly approve a $124 billion war spending bill that requires troop withdrawal
from Iraq to begin by Oct. 1, with a goal of ending U.S. combat operations there by next March. The Senate is expected
to follow the House's 218 to 208 vote with final passage today, completing work on the rarest of bills: legislation to
try to end a major war as fighting still rages. Democrats hope to send the measure to the White House on Monday, almost
exactly four years after President Bush declared an end to major combat in a speech aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln.
That would be a particularly pungent political anniversary for Bush to deliver only the second veto of his presidency.

SEN. LEVIN: THE MAN WITH "A MORE PRAGMATIC TONE": As Democratic leaders have ratcheted up their rhetoric on the Iraq
War in preparation for a veto showdown with the president, Senate Armed Services Chairman Carl Levin (Mich.) — one of
the most influential, and consequently most quoted, Democrats — continues to strike a more pragmatic tone that has
elicited cringes from the left and delight from the right. Levin is arguably as anti-Iraq War as they come, having last
year sponsored one of the first measures intended to draw down U.S. involvement in the region, but his baldfaced
honesty about the fact that Democrats likely will lose the first few rounds in their fight with the White House on the
issue has often appeared to muddy Democratic attempts to frame the debate on the war. Roll Call: In War Debate, Levin
Is Man in the Middle http://www.rollcall.com/issues/52_115/news/18197-1.html

DEMS APPROVE "FLURRY OF SUBPOENAS," INCLUDING ONE FOR CONDI: In a vivid display of their new power, Democrats across
Capitol Hill on Wednesday approved a flurry of subpoenas to fuel a series of investigations of the Bush administration.
The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform issued three subpoenas in quick order. One was to Secretary of
State Condoleezza Rice to answer questions about the administration's prewar claims about Iraq's weapons programs and
two were to the Republican National Committee and its chairman to be questioned about whether the party's e-mail system
was used by Bush officials to conceal some of their actions. New York Times: Flexing Muscles, Democrats Issue 3
Subpoenas http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/26/washington/26subpoena.html

RICE, ON THE ROAD, SIGNALS SHE WON'T APPEAR: Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Thursday she has already answered
the questions she has been subpoenaed to answer before a congressional committee and suggested she is not inclined to
comply with the order. Rice said she would respond by mail to questions from the House Oversight and Government Reform
Committee on the Bush administration's prewar claims about Saddam Hussein seeking weapons of mass destruction, but
signaled she would not appear in person. "I am more than happy to answer them again in a letter," she told reporters in
Oslo, where she is attending a meeting of NATO foreign ministers. AP via Yahoo! News: Rice signals rejection of House
subpoena http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070426/ap_on_go_ca_st_pe/congress_subpoenas_rice

RENZI DIDN'T REPORT $200K PAYMENT: Rep. Rick Renzi (R-Ariz.) failed to disclose a $200,000 payment he received from a
business partner in 2005 in apparent violation of House ethics rules. Prosecutors could use the omission as evidence
that Renzi intended to conceal a transaction he knew to be controversial or even improper. The $200,000 was a payment
from James Sandlin to settle a debt related to a previous business transaction involving land in northeast Arizona, one
of the lawmaker's attorneys, Grant Woods, told a newspaper last week. This explanation might have been expected to
dispel suspicion that Sandlin gave Renzi an illegal gift in exchange for action Renzi took to help Sandlin sell a $4
million parcel of land. But Renzi's claim that Sandlin's $200,000 payment was a legitimate business transaction is
weakened by the fact that he failed to disclose it in his personal financial disclosure report for 2005 filed with the
House clerk. The Hill: Renzi didn't reveal $200K

WH SENT POLITICAL OFFICIALS TO BRIEF AGENCY APPOINTEES: White House officials conducted 20 private briefings on
Republican electoral prospects in the last midterm election for senior officials in at least 15 government agencies
covered by federal restrictions on partisan political activity, a White House spokesman and other administration
officials said yesterday. The previously undisclosed briefings were part of what now appears to be a regular effort in
which the White House sent senior political officials to brief top appointees in government agencies on which seats
Republican candidates might win or lose, and how the election outcomes could affect the success of administration
policies, the officials said. Washington Post: Political Briefings At Agencies Disclosed
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/25/AR2007042503046.html

SCOTUS CONSIDERS CAMPAIGN FINANCE PROVISION: The Supreme Court put defenders of the McCain-Feingold campaign finance
law on the defensive on Wednesday in a spirited argument that suggested the court could soon open a significant
loophole in the measure. At issue is a major provision of the five-year-old law that bars corporations and labor unions
from paying for advertisements that mention the name of a candidate for federal office and that are broadcast 60 days
before an election or 30 days before a primary. By a 5-to-4 vote in December 2003, the court held that the provision,
on its face, passed First Amendment muster. New York Times: Justices Raise Doubts on Campaign Finance
http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/26/washington/26scotus.html

OPPOSITION TO CHENEY BYU VISIT "DRAWING NATIONAL MEDIA ATTENTION":  The vice president's visit is expected to be
popular with the majority of graduates, their family members, faculty and staff. More than 1,000 people signed an
online petition supporting Cheney's visit. Opposition to the visit is drawing national media attention because Utah
Valley is a conservative stronghold where Republicans and unaffiliated registered voters who generally vote Republican
outnumbered Democrats 21-to-1 at the November 2006 elections. At least three demonstrations taking issue with Cheney
are planned today in Provo and Salt Lake City, and a student-organized alternative commencement featuring Ralph Nader
will be held at Utah Valley State College at 7:30 p.m. Nearly 4,000 people signed an online petition asking BYU and the
church to withdraw the invitation to Cheney. Deseret News: 20,000 to hear Cheney at BYU: He'll get honorary doctorate

SELF-DEPRECATION AND ANONYMOUS PRAISE AHEAD OF DEBATE: For presidential hopefuls, it's called the Expectations Game.
Here's how it's played: Before a debate, rival campaigns build up the skills of their opponents while downgrading their
own candidate's verbal abilities. That way, any bright moments make a performance seem like a home run. For the
Democratic hopefuls, the first major round of the Expectations Game came ahead of Thursday night's debate at South
Carolina State University in Orangeburg, S.C. The 90-minute event offers eight candidates their initial chance to
distinguish themselves on the long road to the nomination next year. "I've just got to make sure I don't trip walking
on the stage," joked Delaware Sen. Joe Biden, who complained that the candidates get no opening or closing statements
and that responses to questions are limited to 60 seconds. Illinois Sen. Barack Obama cracked, "It takes me 60 seconds
to clear my throat." AP via Yahoo! News: Dems try to lower debate expectations
http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070426/ap_on_el_pr/democrats_debate

GOP WON'T CEDE THE MEDIA SPOTLIGHT: While Democrats celebrate and enjoy their time in the national spotlight today, the
Republicans will try to turn that shaft into a cold, hard glare. National and state Republicans will spend the day
telling South Carolinians and the country at large why the party believes "Democrats are wrong." According to a copy of
a Republican National Committee plan to be released today, the GOP will launch a major media offensive to counter the
Democratic message coming from Orangeburg. The plan, which was obtained by The State, includes talking points and
research on why the top Democratic candidates are "wrong on the economy for South Carolina," as well as wrong on the
war in Iraq and wrong on South Carolina values. The State: GOP stirs a media storm for Democrats' parade

McCAIN KICKS OFF 5-STATE ANNOUNCEMENT TOUR: John McCain is the first to tell you: He's old, his fund-raising has
lagged, and he strongly supports a deeply unpopular war. But the Arizona senator, in officially launching his bid for
the White House in New Hampshire yesterday, sought to turn his potential liabilities into strengths in hopes of
reigniting his campaign after losing ground and making a series of missteps. With the Portsmouth Naval Yard as a
backdrop, McCain kicked off a five-state announcement tour by telling supporters and bystanders that his time in the
military and in Congress had given him wisdom about the world that no other candidate can claim. McCain, 70, said that
if elected president, he would "use every lesson I've learned through hard experience and the history I've witnessed."

AG DEPARTURE WOULD "BE THE BEST THING THAT HE COULD DO," SAYS McCAIN: Republican presidential candidate Sen. John
McCain said Wednesday that he is "disappointed" in the performance of embattled Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, and
he believes it would be in President Bush's best interests for Gonzales to step aside. "I think that out of loyalty to
the president that that would probably be the best thing that he could do," McCain said in an interview with CNN's
"Larry King Live." McCain, who has been a strong backer of the war in Iraq, also said he was "surprised" and
"disappointed" by Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid's recent statements that he believes the war is lost. The Ticker:
McCain: Gonzales should depart 'out of loyalty' to Bush

GIULIANI TAKING A PAGE FROM THE '04 PLAYBOOK? In his two months on the campaign trail, the central animating theme of
Rudolph W. Giuliani's presidential campaign has been that his performance as New York mayor on Sept. 11, 2001, makes
him the best candidate to keep the United States safe from terrorists. But when Mr. Giuliani broadened that message
here on Tuesday night, saying that Democrats "do not understand the full nature and scope of the terrorist war against
us" and that if they were elected the United States would suffer "more losses," the response from his Democratic rivals
was swift and pointed... The skirmishing, some of the most intense between the parties in the young 2008 campaign,
suggests that a line of attack that the administration used in 2004 would again be a central Republican theme. New York
Times: Giuliani Broadens His Message on Terrorism http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/26/us/politics/26giuliani.html

ROMNEY HITS THE AIRWAVES WITH $2M AD BUY: Mitt Romney began airing commercials Wednesday on national cable networks at
a cost of some $2 million in an attempt to give his identity a lift in the crowded Republican presidential field.
Romney also renewed an ad campaign in Iowa and New Hampshire, a Romney adviser said. Most of the national ads will run
on Fox News, a strategic effort by the Romney camp to reach conservative voters. Lagging in name recognition but flush
with cash, Romney by far is spending the most on advertising of any candidate at this early stage of the presidential
campaign. The Romney adviser spoke on the condition of anonymity because the campaign does not publicize its ad
strategy. In the national ad, called, "I Like Vetoes," Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, says that as
president he would demand that discretionary domestic spending be capped at 1 percent less than the rate of inflation.
AP via Yahoo! News: Romney pays $2M for campaign ad airtime http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070426/ap_on_el_pr/romney_ads


BLOOMBERG SAYS GORE SHOULD JUMP IN: Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday that he hoped former Vice President Al
Gore would run for president in 2008, saying "I think it would be good for the country." The mayor made the comments to
reporters after a news conference kicking off the Tribeca Film Festival, as the two men took the stage and teased each
other over speculation about their respective presidential ambitions. The former vice president was on hand to
highlight the roughly 60 films in the festival that focus on environmental issues. New York Times: Bloomberg Tells Gore
He Should Run in '08 http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/26/us/politics/26gore.html
