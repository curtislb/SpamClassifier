     I've always used ~/.bashrc because it was less global in nature.  I 
had my user profile and my admin profile, and didn't mix the two.  It 
was already set up that way in Debian, and I liked it.  Sometimes it was 
a hassle, but it kept me on the straight and narrow for security 
purposes.  I'd rather move things to /etc/skel and not interfere with 
how others might want to do things.  The global settings are doing that 
to me now, forcing me to keep aliases I don't want. <laughs>  Thank you 
for the info.

        Michael
