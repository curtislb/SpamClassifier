I think we're confusing fat 16 and fat 32.  The 2 gig limit applies for 
fat 16, but when you run fdisk at the dos prompt, it says something like 
"your computer system can support a hard disk larger than-----" "Do you 
want to access this larger disk?"

It is before coffee and way too early in the morning for me to try and 
figure out how they do it.  I don't recall the numbers, I remember 
discussing this stuff years ago on cluster size.  That is the smallest 
amount of space a file would take no matter if it were a one byte file. 
I think it started out at 2 then 4 then 8 then 16 then 32.

Way to early to figure this out!!!
