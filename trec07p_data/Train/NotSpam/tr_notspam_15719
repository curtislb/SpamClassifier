Thanks again, Francesco, for a thorough coverage of this latest GPLv3
draft.

My understanding of FSF's position for many years is that the GPL was
designed only for computer programs. They agree that it *can* be
applied to non-program works of authorship, and that the result is
free software, but I think it's untrue to say it was *designed* to be
applicable that way.

I agree that the GPL is the best FSF license to be applied to any work
of authorship, but the FSF don't agree -- and I believe they expressed
this disagreement long before they started promoting other licenses
designed for non-program works.

If you wish to express this argument, I think you'll need to base it
on something other than "the GPL is designed to be applicable to any
work of authorship".
