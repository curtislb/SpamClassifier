stuckinarut writes "Peer to peer file sharing network popularity is at an
all time high, with hundreds of thousands of computers connected to a
single P2P network at a given time. [0]These networks are increasingly
being used to trick PCs into attacking other machines, experts say. In
fact, some reports indicate that peer-to-peer may actually exceed web
traffic. Computer scientists have previously shown how P2P networks can
be subverted so that several connected PCs gang up to attack a single
machine, flooding it with enough traffic to make it crash. This can work
even if the target is not part of the P2P network itself. Now, security
experts are warning that P2P networks are increasingly being used to do
just this. "Until January of this year we had never seen a peer-to-peer
network subverted and used for an attack," says Darren Rennick of
internet security company Prolexic in an [1]advisory released recently.
"We now see them constantly being subverted.""

Peacenik45 writes "The CBC is reporting that First Nations in Manitoba
want [0]compensation for every cell phone signal that passes through
their land because it violates their airspace. The Assembly of Manitoba
Chiefs recently resolved to negotiate revenue sharing with Manitoba
Telecom Services. Ovide Mercredi of the Grand Rapids First Nations says
"When it comes to using airspace, it's like using our water and simply
because there's no precedent doesn't mean that it's not the right thing
to do." This move may inspire First Nations in other provinces to follow
suit."

Soloway is accused of using botnets to disguise where e-mail originated
and of forging return addresses of real people or businesses for his mass
mailings. If convicted as charged, Soloway will face a maximum sentence
of more than 65 years in prison and a fine of 250,000 dollars."

An anonymous reader writes "Many makers of extensions or add-ons for

new research suggests. A great many add-ons are updated over insecure
(non https://) connections, providing an avenue for attackers to replace
the extension with an evil update. Google's add-ons are particularly
vulnerable, because they update automatically without notifying the user.
>From the story: '[I]f an attacker were to hijack a public Wi-Fi hot spot
at a coffeehouse or bookstore â€” a fairly trivial attack given the myriad
free, point-and-click hacking tools available today â€” he could also
intercept this update process and replace a Firefox add-on with a
malicious one.'" Here is security researcher Chris Soghoian's

[0]eldavojohn writes "A Microsoft executive announced that the [1]next
Windows will be fundamentally redesigned to handle the numerous cores of
present and future processors. The article notes that the NT technology
underneath Vista has been able to take advantage of multiple processors
since 1993, and can now handle 32 or 64 cores. And since Microsoft
completely rewrote the 20-year-old GDI/GDI+ model for Vista, what more
can (or should) they parallelize? It will be interesting to see how
Microsoft tackles the race conditions and deadlocks that come with
pervasively multithreaded software and in the past complicated attempts
(like that of BeOS) to utilize multiple CPUs. Do you think it's it a
smart move to further complicate an operating system to take advantage of
multiple cores, or should Microsoft stick to its knitting while
applications take advantage of (possibly) more resources?"

program Doctor Who will reportedly [1]end next year after its fourth
season. Producer Russell T. Davies has decided to bring the hit sci-fi
show to a close â€” to 'go out at the top' â€” so he can concentrate on other
projects, according to the article. Davies and other senior staff are
feeling the strain of the heavy workload imposed by the show, nine months
a year of 16-hour days, and plan to resign en-masse in 2008. Davies, a
long-time fan of Doctor Who, relaunched the series in 2005, 16 years
after the original series was axed." Update: 05/31 16:36 GMT by [2]KD :
Reader palewook points out that the UK Guardian [3]sets this story
straight: "But there isn't any way it would be axed even if [Davies]
left. He loves the show and he does feel that maybe it would benefit from
some new blood."

help her with the transition, I wrote two [1]intro [2]lessons for her,
but we've hit a stumbling block. The iRivier Clix (4GB) she's been using
syncs with Windows Media Player. My research shows that the model has
both an MTP for the sync and a UMS mode which acts as a mass storage
device. Rhythmbox's 'Scan Removable Media' doesn't pick up anything from
the USB mass storage device, and although [3]Syncropated claims to
support these types of devices, it doesn't find any supported devices.
Unless you use an iPod, this appears to be a real weak point in the Linux
desktop. Do you sync your mass storage devices and music players? What do
you use?"

appropriate software. Computer Bloat does not fare so well. "In order to
keep the hoots and hollers of 'unfair comparison' at a minimum, we
designed the tests to be as fair and equitable as possible. We focussed
on running tests that reflect how the user perceives the computing
experience... And no, we didn't include processing-heavy modern software
like Photoshop or Crysis! We selected very basic everyday functions that
were performed equally by the 1980's and the 2007 Microsoft

dubbelj writes "Germany has updated their computer crime law to
[0]declare 'hacking tools' illegal. This will place most of the
professionals in the network admin and computer security fields in a sort
of legal grey area. 'The new rules tighten up the existing sanctions and
prohibit any unauthorized user from disabling or circumventing computer
security measures to access secure data (see the law, sections 200 and
following [in German]). Manufacturing, programming, installing, or
spreading software that can circumvent security measures is verboten,
which means that some security scanning tools might become illegal.' We
discussed [1]a similar measure in January when Australia considered the
same kind of legislation. How will this affect Linux distribution in
Germany, as most standard Linux distributions come with these kind of
'hacking tools' installed by default?"

[0]blackbearnh writes "Windows has a reputation for being easily
exploited by rootkits, but just because you're using Linux or BSD doesn't
mean you're safe from infection. In an interview on O'Reilly's ONLamp
site, Joseph Kong (author of [1] Designing BSD Rootkits ), talks about
[2]how to build and defend against Rootkits under BSD. 'I know a lot of
people who refer to rootkits and rootkit-detectors as being in a big game
of cat and mouse. However, it's really more like follow the leader â€” with
rootkit authors always being the leader. Kind of grim, but that's really
how it is. Until someone reveals how a specific (or certain class of)
rootkit works, nobody thinks about protecting that part of the system.
And when they do, the rootkit authors just find a way around it. This is
what I meant earlier when I said rootkit hunting is hard â€” as you really
have to validate the integrity of the entire system.'"

Hajsky writes "Ars Technica takes a closer look at Microsoft's new
"Surface" tabletop device. Turns out that Surface [0]isn't actually a
touchscreen at all, but uses five cameras located in the table's base to
record movement and touch. 'The five cameras are near-infrared devices,
but that's not because they are trying to read heat signatures from
fingertips (or other body parts) on the table. Instead, it's because the
entire surface of Surface is bathed in light; by illuminating the top of
the table, the cameras can easily see when things are placed on it.
Shining colored light across the surface of the table would spoil the
effect that Microsoft wants, so near-infrared light is used for invisible
illumination.' The whole setup runs on a Core 2 Duo and off-the-shelf
hardware, and can handle 52 simultaneous touches." jfanning wrote with a
link to an overview of similar technology [1]used in the Helsinki
'CityWall'. The article she provides discusses the unique public display,
and has an in-depth video on the way these kinds of setups work.

The Tie Guy writes "Sling Media's Slingbox allows consumers to watch and
control their home television programs from a remote PC or smartphone â€” a
process called '[0]placeshifting'. Content owners are typically edgy when
it comes to the placeshifting topic. However, most don't view Slingbox as
an imminent threat that will destroy the commercial broadcast model.
[1]Major League Baseball is going against the grain by saying that
Slingbox owners who stream home games while traveling are breaking the
law because it allows consumers to circumvent geographical boundaries
written in to broadcast deals. This has sparked a huge debate that has
the MLB, baseball fans, and the CEA up in arms. CEA President Gary
Shapiro doesn't agree, and is coming to the defense of Sling Media and
place-shifting in general."

[0]coondoggie writes with a link to a NetworkWorld article about [1]the
dangers of IT department snoops. A study released today is likely to
exacerbate the trend of failing trust in employees; it shows that one in
three IT employees poke through systems and prod at confidential
information while on the job. The survey was done by a firm specializing
in password security, so some salt might be required for this particular
article. "The survey found that more than one-third of IT professionals
admit they could still access their company's network once they'd left
their current job, with no one to stop them. More than 200 IT
professionals participated in the survey with many revealing that
although it wasn't corporate policy to allow IT workers to access systems
after termination, still almost 25% of respondents knew of another IT
staff member who still had access to sensitive networks even though
they'd left the company long ago."

SkeeLo writes "One of Vista's big selling points is security, but a
[0]report from CRN concludes that Vista offers little in the way of
security advancements over Windows XP. Ars Technica [1]analyzed the
report and found some methodological problems. 'The report faults Vista
for "providing no improvement in virus protection vs. XP," but of course
Windows Vista does not ship with antivirus software â€” something the
reviewer fails to mention. Faulting an AV-less Vista for not stopping
viruses is a bit like faulting a door without a lock for opening when the
handle is twisted.' That's not all: 'It was also disappointing to see CRN
completely ignore the issue of buffer overflows, which has been addressed
well in Vista by most accounts. This was a major weak spot with XP, and
so far, Vista looks strong in this area, strong enough that Vista may
never get its own "SQL Slammer." Why CRN didn't address this is a
mystery, as it is no minor matter.'"
