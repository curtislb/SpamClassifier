Dear Sir / Madam,



The WTI is among the leading institutions offering education and
training on international trade regulation. As in previous years, we
have been able to organize a number of exciting programmes for the
academic year 2006/2007. Our courses stand out because of their in-depth
treatment of international trade issues, our faculty of globally
renowned experts and our ability to match the needs of professionals
from all over the world. In addition, we are able to offer courses that
take into account the diverse needs of our students: those who wish and
are able to spend a full year in Switzerland to obtain a Master degree,
those who have very little time and can only leave their jobs for a few
weeks and those who have a special interest in particular fields of
international trade regulation.



We therefore would like to draw your attention to the following three
programme options:

*	Our five-week summer school: We have selected six topical areas
on international trade regulation for those who wish to join us for one
or several weeks in July and August 2007. Applications are currently
accepted.
*	Our Master on International Law and Economics (MILE): MILE is an
intensive one-year programme, which will start again in October 2007.
Applications are accepted until 31 May 2007.
*	The possibility to select weekly course modules within that
Master Programme. While this selective way of participating in our
courses will not allow you to complete the Master Programme, you will
gain in-depth insight in particular fields of international trade
regulation. All weekly courses are self-contained units and therefore
accessible to visitors.



Please find more detailed information attached to this email and feel
free to distribute this information to interested individuals. We would
be glad to give you more details about the World Trade Institute and its
programmes. Please contact our Director of Studies, Dr. Nicole Pohl (
nicole.pohl@wti.org) for questions.



We hope to be able to welcome you in Berne for one of our programmes.





Kind regards,



Corinne Karlaganis



for the World Trade Institute
