yes ... i think this was almost, almost, almost made to etch and i see
it as a release target for lenny.

what frans added to the discussion is that debian needs a style guide
and that the installer (mostly) needs to have the debian brand.

i agree with this and i think this should be extended to the rest of the
style.

If someone develop a style for debian, that style could be used
everywhere (d-i, desktop, http server start package ...) .

Frans marked that the *d-i* as installer of the debian distribution
should have a stronger marketing idea. So he argues the use of the
*original* debian logos.

I would suggest that in every style made, the original logo should be
used and the original Debian word (font and i dot colour).
