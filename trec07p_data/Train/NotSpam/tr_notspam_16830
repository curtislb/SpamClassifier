Howdy!

I don't know if you would be interested, but... and if it isn't 
appropriate, apologies and just hit delete.

In a nutshell, an art dealer here in Montreal is attempting to shut down 
my blog and sue me for $25,000, for having linked to newspapers articles 
about his past.

If you would like the detailed background start here:
http://zekesgallery.blogspot.com/2007/05/things-escalate-request-for-injunction.html

and then click here:
http://zekesgallery.blogspot.com/2007/05/judgement.html

As you can see from the judgment I lost the temporary injunction
request, and as a consequence had to remove one post and redact two
others, but now I have received a third C&D, apparently I have run afoul 
of something else - but I am not at all certain what.

These are the articles that I linked to in my blog:
http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=20e22b62-00c2-43e3-8fea-06283958a5e5&k=186

http://lotoquebec.com/corporatif/nav/en/news-room/pressReleaseDetail?Id=626&Sujet=&Mois=

For what it is worth my blog is as popular as any museum website in
Canada and holds its own very nicely in comparison to just about any
museum in the world:

http://tinyurl.com/37w5ro <- Zeke's Gallery vs Canadian Museums
http://tinyurl.com/2pq2zb <- Zeke's Gallery vs American Museums
http://tinyurl.com/34xzer <- Zeke's Gallery vs British Museums
http://tinyurl.com/2t988a <- Zeke's Gallery vs French Museums

Thank you very much in advance, and I hope stuff is better with you.
