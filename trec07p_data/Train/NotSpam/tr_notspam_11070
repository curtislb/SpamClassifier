AIDS DRUGS:
Brazil, Thailand Override Big Pharma Patents
Jon Cohen

Executing a much-repeated threat, Brazil on 4 May broke sharply with
big pharma and for the first time signed a "compulsory license" that
allows the country to make or import a generic version of a patented
anti- HIV drug. Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who
signed the decree in a televised ceremony, took this step shortly
after Thailand decided on similar action with the same drug--
efavirenz--and two others. "Many other countries will likely follow
suit," predicts economist James Love, who runs Knowledge Ecology
International, a think tank in Washington, D.C. Love has urged
developing countries to issue compulsory licenses, which are
permitted by World Trade Organization rules for noncommercial uses of
patented drugs, especially if they involve public health.

Efavirenz is used by nearly 65,000 of the 170,000 people in Brazil
now receiving free treatment from the government. Merck offered
earlier in the week to cut the price from $580 per patient per year
to $400, but Brazil noted that a generic version would reduce costs
to about $165--saving the country an estimated $30 million this year
alone. In a statement, Merck said it was "profoundly disappointed" by
the decision and warned that the "expropriation of intellectual
property sends a chilling signal to research-based companies,"
contending that they "cannot sustain a situation in which the
developed countries alone are expected to bear the cost for essential
drugs." But Pedro Chequer, the former head of Brazil's AIDS program
who now works for the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS,
says, "I am really proud of this wonderful political decision."

Thailand faced similar praise and criticism when it issued compulsory
licenses for efavirenz in November and then again in January for the
anti-HIV drug lopinavir/ritonavir (made by Abbott Laboratories of
Abbott Park, Illinois) and the blood thinner clopidogrel (made by
Sanofi-Aventis of Paris, France). "Thailand's move has stirred up a
hornet's nest," says Jon Ungphakorn, a former Thai senator who
strongly backs his government's actions.

To the astonishment of Ungphakorn and many others in Thailand, Abbott
announced on 14 March that it was pulling applications it had pending
to register seven new medicines for sale in Thailand. Then on 30
April, the Off ice of the U.S. Trade Representative cited Thailand's
issuing of compulsory licenses as one reason for elevating the
country to the dreaded Priority Watch List, a U.S. government warning
to countries that it judges do not adequately protect intellectual
property, which can drive away foreign investment and impact export
tariffs. "It's surprising that the reactions have been so harsh to a
move that is perfectly legal," says Ungphakorn. "What the United
States and Abbott have done to Thailand is to send a message to the
whole developing world: 'Don't you dare carry out compulsory
licenses, or there will be retaliation.' "

Merck and Abbott say they do not understand why Thailand has yet to
accept their latest offers. Merck says it will sell efavirenz to the
country for $237.25 per patient per year--a "no profit" price that
Brazil said it would have agreed to--while Abbott reduced the price
of lopinavir/ritonavir from $2200 to $1000 per patient per year.
(Sanofi-Aventis, which sells clopidogrel in Thailand for about $800
per patient per year, did not reply to an interview request.)

Lawyer Sean Flynn, an intellectual-property expert at American
University in Washington, D.C., who supports Thailand's and Brazil's
actions, says the countries ideally would like to create competition
among generic manufacturers to drive prices as low as possible. And
Flynn flatly dismisses the "tired" argument that R&D would be harmed
by these compulsory licenses, stressing that the drugs were not
initially made for developing countries. "They were created for the
European and U.S. markets, and that's where the incentive comes from
to invest in developing them," contends Flynn, adding that patent
holders also receive some royalties from drugs sold under compulsory
licenses.

Abbott has taken the brunt of the criticism. AIDS advocates in
particular have protested its plans to withdraw the registration of
its new drugs, including a heat-stable form of lopinavir/ritonavir
that's badly needed in Thailand. "Patients are being penalized,"
charges Paul Cawthorne, head of the Thai mission for Médecins Sans
Frontières. "It's disgusting and completely unethical." Such
criticism is misguided, counters Abbott spokesperson Dirk van Eeden:
"The Thai government said it will not buy it, so why is there a need
for us to register it?" he asks.

Although a handful of countries have issued compulsory licenses for
AIDS drugs without kicking up much of a fuss, all involved older,
first-generation drugs. Now the second-line treatments are at stake.
Economist Love adds that big pharma feels threatened that this
movement could go beyond AIDS to heart disease and other ailments.
"There's a big push in Thailand to do it for everything," says Love.

Merck notes that it "remains flexible and committed to exploring a
mutually acceptable agreement" with Brazil, and Thailand on 14 May
plans to hold a meeting with Merck, Abbott, and Sanofi-Aventis to
attempt again to negotiate lower prices for their products.
