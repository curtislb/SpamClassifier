One final note, to call the proceedings a "UN document" is a gross
distortion... The conference was not I believe an "official" UN conference
but may have been "endorsed" by one or another UN agency--it happens
fairly often; and the proceedings were the proceedings of a mostly
Austrian funded and sponsored conference that mattered very little in the
great scheme of things and wasn't so far as I know of much significance
even in the context of WSIS.
