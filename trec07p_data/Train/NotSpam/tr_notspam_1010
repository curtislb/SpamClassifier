Surely the only benefit of splitting out record types per-file (i.e.
client and share) is that you can step through the allocated records as
an array rather than a linked list?  Is there really much performance
gain there?  I imagine the code to step through the list and add/remove
records will stay pretty much the same.

That's pretty much the plan.  Each class of extended stats when summed
together should equal the existing profiling stats (in theory).

Yep.

I'll look into it, thanks :)  Right now there's just the regular
GetTimeOfDay calls.

Sure that makes sense.  So, with that in mind, what's the best way to
export a Samba header file for consumer apps?  For instance, in the case
of the smbprofile.h header, it uses stuff like enum flush_reason_enum
and typedef BOOL which are defined elsewhere that third-party apps can't
see.  Is the correct approach to write a script that munges the header
into something that could potentially stand alone in a "devel" package?
