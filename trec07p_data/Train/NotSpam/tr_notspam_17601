CBS NEWS STS-117 STATUS REPORT: 24
Posted: 10:10 AM, 6/8/07

CBS News Space Analyst

Changes and additions:

   SR-22 (06/06/07): Shuttle dodges severe storms
   SR-23 (06/07/07): Weather improves to 80 percent 'go'
   SR-24 (06/08/07): Shuttle Atlantis fueled for launch; weather 80 percent=
 'go'

10:10 AM, 6/8/07, Update: Shuttle fueling begins; weather remains 80 percen=
t 'go'=20

Engineers at the Kennedy Space Center began pumping a half-million gallons =
of supercold liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen rocket fuel into the shuttle=
 Atlantis' repaired external tank today at 9:55 a.m., setting the stage for=
 launch at 7:38 p.m. on a space assembly mission. This will be NASA's first=
 shuttle flight of 2007, thanks to a three-month delay to fix hail damage.

The three-hour fueling process, carried out by remote control from the firi=
ng room 3.2 miles from launch pad 39A, should be complete around 1 p.m. NAS=
A television coverage is scheduled to begin at 1:30 p.m. followed by a trad=
itional dining room photo opportunity with the crew.

Wearing bright orange pressure suits, commander Rick Sturckow, pilot Lee Ar=
chambault, flight engineer Steve Swanson, Patrick Forrester, Danny Olivas, =
Jim Reilly and space station astronaut Clay Anderson are scheduled to depar=
t crew quarters at 3:47 p.m. and head for the pad.

Sturckow will strap into the front left seat on Atlantis' flight deck with =
Archambault to his right. Swanson will sit behind and between the two pilot=
s with Forrester to his immediate right. On the shuttle's lower deck, Oliva=
s will strap in just in front of the ship's side hatch. Reilly and Anderson=
 will take seats just behind and to the right of Olivas.

Launch is targeted for roughly the moment Earth's rotation carries the laun=
ch pad into the plane of the space station's orbit. As of this writing, the=
 "in-plane" launch time is 7:38:04 p.m. That might be adjusted by a few sec=
onds during a final hold at the T-minus nine-minute mark based on a final a=
nalysis of the station's orbit. Today's launch window will close at 7:43:04=
 p.m.

There are no technical problems at pad 39A and officials say the forecast r=
emains unchanged, with a strong sea breeze expected to push afternoon thund=
ershowers well inshore. Shuttle weather officers in Florida are predicting =
an 80 percent chance of acceptable conditions today and they upgraded the f=
orecast for Saturday to 80 percent "go" as well.

"An upper level low off the east coast of Florida is creating a broad shiel=
d of mid clouds and rain showers along the Space Coast," the weather office=
 said in its morning forecast. "This low and the associated showers should =
gradually move southwest allowing drier mid-level air to move in by launch =
time. At the surface, easterly winds will allow the sea breeze and its asso=
ciated weather to push inland by early afternoon.

"Upper level winds are forecast to be from the east today, so anvils from a=
ny inland thunderstorms that develop should remain inland by launch time. B=
y Saturday afternoon the upper level low is forecast to be over southern Fl=
orida, creating favorable conditions for launch; therefore, the 24-hour for=
ecast probability of KSC weather prohibiting launch is decreased to 20%. Ou=
r primary concern for launch day is cumulus clouds."

The forecast from the Spaceflight Meteorology Group at the Johnson Space Ce=
nter in Houston, which focuses on landing weather in case of an emergency t=
hat might force a quick return to Earth, calls for scattered clouds at 3,00=
0, 10,000 and 25,000 feet with winds out of 100 degrees at 8 knots gusting =
to 12. The crosswind component at the shuttle's emergency runway is just 9 =
knots well within NASA's launch guidelines. Likewise, the weather at emerge=
ncy landing sites in California, New Mexico, Spain and France is forecast "=
go."
