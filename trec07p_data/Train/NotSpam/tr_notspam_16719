Probably.  Are you loading snd_pcm_oss, snd_mixer_oss, and possibly 
snd_seq_oss?  I can't believe that Debian doesn't load Alsa modules 
automatically!  Even Slackware does that.  BTW, to get Mplayer to use Alsa 
by default, add this to your .mplayer/config.

ao=alsa

First, make sure that Mplayer supports Alsa by running the command 
"mplayer -ao help" which will show what audio devices are compiled in.
