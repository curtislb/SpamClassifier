Canada will be holding a lunchtime side-event on the subject of IP and
Competition on Wednesday at 1pm in Room B.  This event follows from
last February's PCDA, where the delegation of Canada mentioned that its
Competition Bureau and its Intellectual Property Office had
commissioned several studies on IP and competition.  Given the interest
expressed by some Member States, Canada's Competition Bureau will
present on why it commissioned the studies, highlighting the findings
and speaking about our approach to IP and competiton more generally.
