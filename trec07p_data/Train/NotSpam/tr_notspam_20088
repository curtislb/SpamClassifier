Hi Zach,
I am pursuing an M.S. degree in comp sci, and I've used software
speech on the laptop for nearly a year now.  I refuse to carry a
hardware synth.  I already carry an external keyboard, because I
dislike laptop keyboards.  Plugging in one or two peripherals is a
pain, if you ask me.  Plus, if you are anything like I am, then there
won't be any room in your laptop bag to carry a hardware synth.
I have never had to ask a sighted person to read Linux boot messages
for me, ever.  The only time I ask people to read screens for me is
when I need to use the university's Windows systems (a rarity).
I usually find a sighted female to help me with this; it gives me a
good excuse to listen to a pleasant non-robotic voice.
In any case, most of the people at university will not mind helping
you with such a small thing.

999 times out of 1000, you'll boot your laptop, speech-dispatcher and
friends will start, and all will be well.

Just my two cents,
-- Chris
