Sorry, but the phrase "different-in-spirit" rankled me a little bit.  Perl 6
is definitely NOT different in spirit. In fact, Perl 6 is all about the
spirit of Perl but changing some of the details that have held it back. All
of the spirity things of Perl 5 are still present in Perl 6: TMTOWTDI, easy
things easy, hard things possible, etc.
