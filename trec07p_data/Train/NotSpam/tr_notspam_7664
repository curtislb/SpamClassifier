rfind.bat in batchfiles checks the registry for all of these but it does
not set the path (although it does output a possible path you can use
without actually setting it) since I wanted the command to be completely
safe, i.e. display only.

C:\>path=c:\windows;c:\windows\system32

You indicated the problem with including them is that it would make the
R download twice as large so the size is the key issue, at least based
on your prior comments as I understand them.

Yes, that's what I meant.  I realize its not feasible to rewrite latex and the
help compiler.

I am not sure about this.  rfind.bat currently uses the registry to find
them.  Is there anything wrong with the way it works?
