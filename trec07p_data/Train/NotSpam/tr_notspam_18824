11:34 AM, 6/13/07, Update: Solar array retraction work begins=20

Flight controllers began the retraction of the P6-2B solar array on the int=
ernational space station, pausing after pulling the central mast in one 45-=
inch bay. The astronauts aboard shuttle Atlantis and the international spac=
e station trained cameras on the fragile solar array to help controllers in=
 Houston determine whether any of the folding slats making up the two solar=
 blankets would fold properly or whether then might bend backward as retrac=
tion continued.

The P6-2B array's central mast is an open framework truss that assembles it=
self into square bays when driven outward and collapses into a canister as =
it is retracted. The mast stretches some 115 feet and is made up of 30.5 op=
en-framework bays when fully extended.

Seeing possible problems after the first one-bay retraction, a "wiggle" tes=
t was carried out in which the arrays were jogged back and forth about thei=
r long axis in a motion similar to rolling a pencil between thumb and foref=
inger. The idea was to set up a gentle motion in the flexible blankets to c=
oax all of the slats to line up properly along their creases. Flight contro=
llers then told the astronauts to pull the central mast in one more bay.

They did so, sending rippling waves up and down the blanket slats as the re=
traction motion started and then stopped. Another wiggle test was ordered t=
o help a few recalcitrant slats line up properly and by 11:30 a.m., three r=
etraction commands had been sent and the mast had been retracted three 45-i=
nch bays. During work to retract the other half of the P6 array last Decemb=
er, 71 commands were required, along with an unplanned spacewalk to manuall=
y release stuck guide wires and ensure proper folding.

And so it went as engineers assessed the blankets and their ability to fold=
 properly into storage boxes at the base of the array. The slow, step-by-st=
ep strategy appeared promising, but it was not immediately clear how far th=
e team would get today. The flight plan includes blocks of time today, Thur=
sday and Friday to work on array retraction.

In the space station's Quest airlock, meanwhile, astronauts Pat Forrester a=
nd Steve Swanson pressed ahead with preparations for a planned six-and-a-ha=
lf-hour spacewalk to complete activation of a newly installed set of solar =
arrays on the right end of the station's main power truss. Depending on whe=
re the P6-2B retraction effort stands, they may be asked to provide manual =
assistance to get any balky slats to fold properly.

The spacewalk is scheduled to begin at 2:08 p.m.
