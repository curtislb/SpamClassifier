HIV drug price slashed

By Andrew Jack in London

Published: May 15 2007 03:00 | Last updated: May 15 2007 03:00

Boehringer Ingelheim, the privately-controlled German pharmaceutical
company, is to slash the price of a pivotal HIV drug in the developing
world and waive all barriers to generic manufacturers producing low-cost
copies.

In an interview with the Financial Times, Alessandro Banchi, chairman of
the company's managing board, unveiled measures to boost low-cost access to
its medicine nevirapine (Viramune). "We want to solve the problem (of
access) once and for all," he said.

Boehringer Ingelheim will reduce the price of the drug by 50 per cent to 60
cents a day per patient in 78 low-income countries, and by up to 90 per
cent to $1.20 in 67 middle-income countries. In wealthy nations it sells
for $10-14 a day.

Separately, the company will waive 5 per cent royalty payments, reporting
requirements and other existing obligations for generic producers approved
by the World Health Organisation to make nevirapine using voluntary
licences to override patents on the drug, in favour of a "non assert"
policy.

The action will put fresh pressure on other drug companies to cut medicine
prices in poorer countries for essential medicines, at a time when Brazil
and Thailand recently announced compulsory licences to override rival
companies' patents in spite of the manufacturers' objections.

The move follows a disappointing take up by low-cost generics producers of
Boehringer Ingelheim's previous offer to issue voluntary licences, as it
attempts to stimulate others to produce its drug at the lowest possible
cost.

In a blow to rivals' claims that deeper discounts are not possible without
removing necessary incentives to innovation, Mr Banchi added: "Preferential
pricing is the only way how we can meet both conflicting needs in the fight
against Aids. We can refinance our high research and development costs for
innovative, new treatments by the established price system in
industrialised countries and can offer affordable medicines to patients in
poor countries who otherwise cannot afford antiretroviral medication."

Boehringer Ingelheim last year reported worldwide sales of â‚¬276m ($373m)
from nevirapine, a modest amount compared with its other drugs. Mr Banchi
said that if the decision to produce the drug was made on economic grounds
alone, he would have ceased manufacture.

Nearly a third of nevirapine is supplied to the developing world, where it
has also provided 1m treatments free of charge since 2000to prevent
mother-to-child transmission of HIV.
