As hinted at by Brian Ripley, the following code will approximate that. 
  It gets the nonparametric confidence interval for the median and 
solves for the variance that would give the same confidence interval 
width if normality of the median held.

  g <- function(y) {
     y <- sort(y[!is.na(y)])
     n <- length(y)
     if(n < 4) return(c(median=median(y),q1=NA,q3=NA,variance=NA))
     qu <- quantile(y, c(.5,.25,.75))
     names(qu) <- NULL
     r <- pmin(qbinom(c(.025,.975), n, .5) + 1, n)  ## Exact 0.95 C.L.
     w <- y[r[2]] - y[r[1]]                         ## Width of C.L.
     var.med <- ((w/1.96)^2)/4      ## Approximate variance of median
     c(median=qu[1], q1=qu[2], q3=qu[3], variance=var.med)
   }

Run g separately by group, add the two variances, and take the square 
root to approximate the variance of the difference in medians and get a 
confidence interval.
