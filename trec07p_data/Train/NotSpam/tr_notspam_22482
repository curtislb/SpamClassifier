     Thanks!  I'm not putting Linux online until I have a decent 
iptables firewall up and running.  I already have the script, only it's 
copied from a Firefox session in Windows.  Wonder if I should download 
the other, or just create sym-links.  Decisions, decisions.  Do you know 
of a similar stdin/out filter akin to htm2txt?  Was thinking of having 
procmail pass everything through that prior to delivery, killing off any 
questionable java code.  Hell.  Might as well just pass anything with 
java in it to /dev/nul. <grins>  I figure anyone wanting to take control 
of my system that badly isn't exactly the friendly type.

         Michael
