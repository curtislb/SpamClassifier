Check the bugs on Email::MIME.
IIRC there's an error when the response is '' which is legal but not  
handled by the code.

I submitted a bug a couple of years ago and I don't believe it's been  
fixed.

I found MIME::Tools to be the absolute best in parsing MIME content  
in it's ability to give me meaningful information back and to avoid  
errors.  It's an oldie but a goodie.  Another might be MIME::Fast  
which is based on gmime.
