Using movedir.bat or copydir.bat from batchfiles:

http://code.google.com/p/batchfiles/

you can move or copy your old packages over to the new R tree.
It won't overwrite any so you can do that even after you have
installed some by some other method such as that you describe
below.  Once you have moved or copied them over you can do
an update just to be sure.  See the README file for details.
