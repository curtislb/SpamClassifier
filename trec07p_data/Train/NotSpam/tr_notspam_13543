Mark your calendars:

KEI hosts: "The New US Trade Agenda and Access to Medicines"

Date:  Wednesday, May 30th, 2007
Time:  12:30-2:00pm
Venue:  1621 Connecticut Avenue Suite 500, Washington, DC 20009

Knowledge Ecology International will host a brown bag lunch and panel
discussion on the generic drug/intellectual property provisions in
the guidelines for a new US trade policy recently released by the
Congressional Ways and Means Committee and the Bush Administration.
The new trade document is available here:
http://waysandmeans.house.gov/Media/pdf/110/05%2014%2007/05%2014%
2007.pdf

The new trade policy will impact US free trade agreements with Peru
and Panama and could shape both the content and the process for
approving future US FTAs.  The document includes changes to the US's
stance on data exclusivity, patent extensions, linkage, and use of
side letters.  Experts to be announced will participate in a panel
discussion and Q&A on the impact of the proposed trade changes on
access to medicines.  More details to follow.

Please RSVP to ben.krohmal@keionline.org or call 202 332 2670.
