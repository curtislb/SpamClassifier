Well, Wednesday evening I was on the phone with Mike, the author of YASR.  We 
eventually got YASR running through speech-dispatcher and the new IBM TTS. 
Last week some1 mentioned we needed an emacs server for YASR?  Well, can you 
please tell us how-and-where?  Main drawback is that when speech-dispathcer is 
running, I cannot use my sound-card for anything else.  We could not find any 
commands to start TTS, so Mike used telnet to controll it.  I really like the 
sound of this eliquence clone--and some day I may want to even run speakup 
occasionally through it, as I am still having some issues with Dec-Talk. 
Thanks in advance--and I will send along helpful comments to Mike
Hart
