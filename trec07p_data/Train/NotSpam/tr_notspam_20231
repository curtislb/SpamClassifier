These are the outcomes of the last week's WIPO development agenda, pulled
together by EFF's Gwen Hinze and some others, and posted to EFF's
Deeplinks Blog (which also has more notes and comments from the
negotiations).
(http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/005320.php)

Notice first that these new June 15, 2007 PCDA recommendations and
proposals are *added* to ones that were negotiated in the February PCDA
meeting.  (See:
http://www.wipo.int/pressroom/en/articles/2007/article_0011.html#pcda) In
both cases (February and June), there are no brackets on the
recommendations.  This is finished, months before the WIPO General
Assembly meeting, where they will be officially adopted.

By reading this document (and/or the earlier one), particularly the
substantive ANNEX B, it is clear how much WIPO has changed (for the
better) in the past year.

Here are the new June 15 recommendations and proposals:
---

resources, to promote, inter alia, the legal, commercial, cultural,
and economic exploitation of intellectual property in these countries.

broader societal interests and especially development-oriented
concerns, with a view that "the protection and enforcement of
intellectual property rights should contribute to the promotion of
technological innovation and to the transfer and dissemination of
technology, to the mutual advantage of producers and users of
technology knowledge and in a manner conducive to social and economic
welfare, and to a balance of rights and obligations", in accordance
with Article 7 of the TRIPS Agreement.
