Then maybe you indeed need to change a BIOS setting or the card simply
does not have more video ram. I never had a savage card, therefore I am
not aware of whatever specific tricks might exist for these models.
Let's focus on the mouse problem for now as this seems to be the
critical thing which keeps your X from starting.

I am surprised that you do not have the "by-id" and "by-path"
directories in /dev/input. I am starting to suspect that there is
something wrong with udev on your system. (udev is responsible for
creating the device nodes.) Can you post the output of these two
commands:

dpkg -l udev hotplug
uname -a

Meanwhile you can try a few more things:

Make sure that the "mdetect" package is installed and run "mdetect" as
root. It should give you two lines of output, the device node and the
protocol for your mouse. Try to use these strings for "Device" and
"Protocol" in your /etx/X11/xorg.conf.

You can search for the mouse device yourself by testing each device
node. As root you can run, e.g.

cat /dev/input/mice | hd

and move the mouse. If you have used the right device node then you
should see output (codes) scrolling by. (You can exit with CTRL + C.)
Can you find the device node for the mouse? (also try the mouseX ones)

Well, at least we know now that the mouse is the most critical part at
the moment.
