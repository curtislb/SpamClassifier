I know most folks around here are avid Windows Haters, but in case there are some hungry job defficient programmer types who would do Windows for 
money...  (grin)

Nick,

I have been given permission to distribute the job announcement below, for the position vacated by Bob Alexander.  It doesn't mention Kurzweil 1000, but 
that was an oversight in the composition of the announcement, and K1K and K3K share alot of "core code".
