<B>TONIGHT ON SHOWBIZ TONIGHT - CNN HEADLINE PRIME 11pm
ET/PT</B>

<B>THE WORST CELEBRITY ROLE MODELS!</B>
A startling look at why a lot of people actually think the
likes of Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan are good role models!
But who is really the worst role model of them all? Plus,
Showbiz Tonight's A.J. Hammer goes one-on-one with <b>Angelina
Jolie</b> to get her thoughts on these out of control starlets.


<B>HILARIOUS PARIS HILTON SPOOF</B>
Remember Paris Hilton's song "Stars are Blind"? Yes, it hurt
our ears too. But tonight, Showbiz Tonight has the creators of
an absolutely hysterical Paris Parody of that song. It's called
"Paris in Jail." You don't want to miss this!

<B>KELLY CLARKSON IN CRISIS?!?!</B>
A fight with legendary music producer Clive Davis. Her manager
- fired! And now, Kelly does the unthinkable: she cancels her
summer tour. What's going on? Is the career of one of the
biggest recording stars out there - falling apart? Showbiz
Tonight investigates

<b>INSIDE REHAB OF THE RICH AND FAMOUS</B>
Well, you won't believe what some of these celebrity rehab
centers are like. Whether it is Britney Spears at Promises in
the sunny beach town of Malibu, California, or Lindsay Lohan at
the posh Wonderland Center in L.A., rehab for the stars doesn`t
seem all that different from taking a vacation at the fanciest
spa. Tonight, Showbiz Tonight is taking you along for an inside
look at rehab of the rich and famous.
