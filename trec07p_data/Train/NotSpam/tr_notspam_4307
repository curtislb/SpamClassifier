Hi all

I'd apreciate suggestions on a lightweight console based file browser and 
manager that
works well with Speakup.

I've read about Midnight Commander; does it work fine?

I'd like for example a file manager capable of making file types
associations with specific programs like in MS-Windows if possible.

Thanks,

Cleverson
