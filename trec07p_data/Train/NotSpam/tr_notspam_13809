In the console running X (usually TTY7), just press the printscreen
key. That will shut off Speakup for only that console and you're good
to go. You can then have the other consoles talking with no
problems. The only side effect is that you'll have to cancel the
screen capture dialog, so don't do this until after Orca is running :)
