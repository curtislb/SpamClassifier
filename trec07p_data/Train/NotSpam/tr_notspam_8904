But Donny isn't making public statements about his care for the
environment. I can see hypocrisy by Kate by making statements
about caring for the environment, then living in a large property.

Maybe Kate's carbon footprint is not as big as it could be without
efforts she does, but I'd guess that Kate makes a bigger absolute
carbon footprint than Donny just from heating/cooling her place
and all the electricity usage from cameras, video, etc.
