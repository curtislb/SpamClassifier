No.  I'm asking why this is any different.  If we should protect our goodwill,
then my concern is justified.

If any debian developers think sweatshop-sewn shirts of subsidised cotton
does not reflect badly on the project, that's disappointing and contrary
to recent surveys in the news.

Now, any got a reply to the substance rather than the language?  Why should
we protect goodwill in one narrow way while allowing it to slip away in
another more widespread way?

I believe gambling debian goodwill on our derivatives is less dangerous
than the current gambling of debian goodwill on unethical merchandise.
