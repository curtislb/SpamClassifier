On my Linux, all the places where components of R might normally
be installed (/usr/lib or /usr/local/lib) are user=root, group=root,
and when I look under them practically everything is writeable
only by user=root. So you'd have to change a lot of permissions
before any other user got rights to write to these directories.
Even adding a user to group=root wouldn't change things, since
group does not have write permissions (unless user=root too).

I'm still wondering, though, why you don't just run the command
update.packages() as root. You have root access, and you said
(in the "adding user to group" context) that only one user is
involved (presumably yourself?). In that case, why not start R
as root and run update.packages()?

Or am I missing something?

Best wishes,
Ted.
