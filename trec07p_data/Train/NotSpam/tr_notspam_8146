Bringing trust back to the Getty 
As L.A. giant struggles, new chief takes helm 
By Jim Farber, Staff Writer
U-Entertainment 
Article Last Updated:05/05/2007 06:06:23 PM PDT 
 
With a scant three months on the job under his belt, James Wood, the new
president and CEO of the J. Paul Getty Trust, is trying to get his arms
around his new position. 

At the same time, he's confronting the Gulliver-esque challenge of being a
stranger in the strange land of Los Angeles. 

The 66-year-old Bostonian, who from 1980 to 2004 served as director and
president of the Art Institute of Chicago, finds himself presiding over the
third-largest foundation in America, at a time when the Getty Trust is eager
to dispel the clouds of scandal that have blackened its reputation. 

Wood replaces former president Barry Munitz, who resigned under pressure in
February 2006, following revelations that he had abused the trust's
not-for-profit status. 

A civil investigation by the state Attorney General's Office, the results of
which were released Oct. 2, concluded that "while improper expenditures were
made" - such as using charitable funds for first-class travel and luxury
lodging and dining for Munitz - no crimes had been committed. 

Nevertheless, the attorney general determined, "It is appropriate to appoint
an independent monitor to ensure that trustees and employees of the trust
implement and comply with the policy and procedural reforms" recommended in
the report. 

Seated in the trust's panoramic boardroom atop the Getty Center in
Brentwood, with its Olympian view of the city below, Wood comes across as
candid and enthusiastic about his new role. 

White-haired, tall and distinguished, the first thing he does is shed the
jacket of his elegant black suit, revealing a scarlet and black knit tie
that, perhaps, hints at a piquant subversiveness beneath his otherwise
conservative exterior. 

Wood's love and appreciation of art is obvious, especially as Entering eye
of the storm 

the recipient of multiple degrees in art history nostalgically recalls the
year he spent as a student exploring the treasures of Italy on a motorcycle.


He's also a realist and a sufficiently skilled administrator to admit that,
at this point, he doesn't have all the answers to the hard questions that
confront the Getty. 

Before accepting the job, Wood says, there was one important factor he
needed to determine - whether the Getty had hit bottom with its problems. 

Was the institution on the way up, or was it still spiraling down? 

"I had plenty of chances to talk with the board," he says. "And it was clear
to me that they had absolutely hit bottom. They had grasped the problems.
They had dealt with the problems. I wanted to know enough not to repeat
mistakes." 

Wood points out that the institution has a monitor overseeing it, which he
calls "understandable given what we went through." 

"The board has totally redone its guidelines for expenditures, which they
should. We are a nonprofit institution, a public trust. Every penny that is
not spent on salaries, operations and expenses needs to go into programs and
collection acquisitions. ... We have an opportunity to set an example of
correct governance and the wise use of funds. And we damn well better." 

There still remains, however, one rattling skeleton in the Getty's closet -
former curator of antiquities Marion True, who remains on trial in Rome (and
could go on trial in Greece) for conspiring to purchase and import for the
Getty's collection that prosecutors allege were looted and smuggled out of
the country. True has denied any wrongdoing. 

"The Getty made mistakes in acquisition," Wood says categorically. 

"But with hindsight - and I am not trying to justify it - the ethics of
collecting have changed a lot over the last 30 years. And they should have
changed. 

"The Getty's not the only museum that's struggled through that evolution,
but I think it was more about poor governance and management. We hope we can
resolve the problem with the Italians. It will take time." 

In Wood's estimation, the components that make up the Getty Trust - the
Foundation, the Conservation Institute, the museums and the Research
Institute - should add up to something greater than the sum of its parts. 

"It's a question of getting together the right creative mix of people,
expertise and programming," Wood says. "The Getty has the resources and
capabilities to go way beyond the needs of its own collections. We can
literally go out and create a project to preserve cave paintings in China.
That's totally different from a regular museum and something I find very
exciting." 

The critical consideration 

of antiquities Maximizing its potential 

A justified image? 

Accurate or not, the Getty has always had something of an ivory tower image,
whether it's the perception of the Getty Villa as a hidden refuge or the
imposing architecture of the Getty Center (conceived by architect Richard
Meier) that stands above the 405 Freeway like a fortress. 

"Everyone has their analogy. The worst is Masada," he says with a laugh. 

A key question he faces - and it's not a new one - is, how can he and his
institution best relate to such a sprawling megalopolis. 

"That's a really important issue to me," Wood says. "We've got to be a
strong, generous citizen. But, at the same time, we are an institution with
international responsibilities. They should not be contradictory. It's a
balancing act. 

"The kids on the buses and the scientific project in China are the ends of a
spectrum that should help each other," he says. 

As for his own description of the Getty, the former student of Italian art
and architecture chooses one in keeping with his background. 

"To me, the really important analogy is the piazza. It's the place where art
and the public mingle."

Lost and not found: India's stolen artefacts

Theft is chipping away slowly but surely at India's heritage treasures, with
at least 32 idols and artefacts under the protection of the archaeological
authority going missing in the last three years.

>From correspondents in Delhi, India, 6 May 2007 - (www.indiaenews.com)

Theft is chipping away slowly but surely at India's heritage treasures, with
at least 32 idols and artefacts under the protection of the archaeological
authority going missing in the last three years.

According to data from the ministry of culture, 38 protected works of art
have been stolen since 2004 but law-enforcing agencies have managed to find
only six of them.

Among those recovered are a Shivling from the Bumzuva Cave in Anantnag
district of Jammu and Kashmir, a Jain image of Alathur in Tamil Nadu and an
Anant Shesh idol from the Laxman temple in Chhattisgarh.

While these were under the protection of the Archaeological Survey of India
(ASI), many others too have been stolen and probably smuggled abroad.

'The theft cases are a cause of concern for the ministry of culture and we
have asked the concerned state governments to take up the issue in a more
strict manner. Two cases, one each in West Bengal and Bihar, have been
handed over to the CBI and they are doing a good job,' Tourism and Culture
Minister Ambika Soni told IANS.

The ASI has collected theft data from all over the country and submitted a
report card to the culture ministry. Among the states, Madhya Pradesh tops
the list of places from where relics have been stolen followed by Rajasthan.

In Madhya Pradesh, 14 art objects, including 11 sandstone sculptures, and
one stone sculpture have been stolen.

Among these are two Buddha idols - one in sitting posture and the other in
meditating posture - that have been missing since Jan 20 this year. However,
the state police recovered one female deity, Tara.

In Rajasthan, 10 artefacts, including seven sculptures from several parts of
the state and one wheel and cart frame from the Archaeological Museum in
Kalibagan, are missing.

However, what is heartening is the recovery of 17 of the 18 idols that had
been missing from Patna Museum. These are not part of the 32 ASI protected
artefacts missing since 2004.

Eighteen bronze idols have been stolen from the state-owned museum Sep 27,
2006. The case was handed over to the CBI and so far 17 idols have been
recovered, the theft report card of the ministry stated.

Apart from ASI protected artefacts, one relic from the Kolkata-based Indian
Museum, an autonomous body under the ministry of culture, has been missing
since Dec 29, 2004.

After the state police failed to crack the case and recover the stone head
of Lord Buddha, the case was handed over to the Central Bureau of
Investigation (CBI).

Elaborating on the smuggling of artworks from India, ASI director general C.
Babu Rajeev said: 'We have already signed an agreement with China to stop
illegal smuggling of these heritage items. Such agreements with other
countries are in the pipeline.'

Idol theft in Delhi and its adjoining areas is also peaking. In January,
this year, 10 precious idols were stolen from a Jain temple in Gurgaon on
the outskirts of Delhi. The idols were made of 'ashtadhatu' or eight metals,
and some were up to five centuries old.

A 900-year-old idol stolen from a temple in Uttar Pradesh was recovered in
Delhi and two people were arrested in connection with the theft last month.

In another incident, three 700-year-old Jain idols costing Rs.130 million on
the international market were recovered in Delhi in March from a man who
allegedly planned to smuggle them out of the country. In the three above
cases, the idols were not ASI protected.

Soni said her ministry is in touch with Indian embassies abroad to keep a
close tab on such illegal activities and is consulting the CBI to devise
ways to curb them. The government is planning amendments to the Antiquities
and Art Treasures Act, 1972 to make the provisions more stringent.
