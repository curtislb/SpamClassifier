   If you blinked, you missed it.  After about an hour and 10 minutes of 
"debate" (mostly patting each other on the back), the bill has passed.

Here is my summary:

   http://www.digital-copyright.ca/node/4011

   I sent a quick letter to each of the 10 members who spoke, but I 
don't expect much to come out of it.  Of the people who spoke, it was 
only the 3 NDP members who urged caution on the general trend suggested 
in this legislation.  Mr. Angus took some time to speak about copyright 
in general, opposition to the outdated 1996 WIPO treaties, and so-on.
