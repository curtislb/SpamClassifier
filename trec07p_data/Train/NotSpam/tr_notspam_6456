BOSTON, May 01, 2007 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- SatCon Technology Corporation(R)
(Nasdaq CM: SATC), a developer of power management and system
architecture solutions for the alternative energy and distributed power
markets, today announced that its SatCon Applied Technology division has
been awarded an additional $2.5M contract with a California customer for
the next phase of pulse power equipment capable of providing 8.8
megawatts of power for several seconds. The total system will have pulse
power capabilities in excess of 18 megawatts. Delivery of the first
stage is scheduled for June 2007 and this new Stage 2 delivery is
scheduled for October 2007. This pulse power application is an
adaptation of SatCon's high power electronics and flywheel energy
storage products.

pleased to be participating in this pulse power program. This contract
supports leadership in supplying power conversion and energy storage
products. These types of programs allow customers to draw low levels of
power from the grid and then supply large pulses of power for unique
applications." 

The award expands on SatCon's portfolio of power electronics products
with the development of an integrated pulse power energy storage system.
This technology has direct applicability to both civilian and government
customers.
