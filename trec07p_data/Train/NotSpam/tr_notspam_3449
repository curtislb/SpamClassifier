Indeed.

Note that you have voice recording/playback (including Ogg Speex  
compression) in the Etoys activity.

For example, it is being integrated with the "Event Theater", which  
allows you to record and playback an interactive session with voice- 
over. This is primarily meant for creating tutorials, but you could  
as well tell stories with it.

There also is a Klatt-style speech synthesizer for Squeak, with  
matching facial animation of cartoon figures. Very entertaining, but  
I wouldn't have any kid learn English from that ;)
