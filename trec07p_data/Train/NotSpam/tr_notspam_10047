NPPA gets upper hand in trade margin tussle with Novartis

GIREESH CHANDRA PRASAD

TIMES NEWS NETWORK[ FRIDAY, MAY 11, 2007 03:15:19 AM]
NEW DELHI: Swiss drug-maker Novartis, which has sued the government for
denying patent for a cancer drug, may get another rap on the knuckle.
This time, it is on the pricing of Vitalux Plus, a multi-vitamin tablet
that stays in blood stream steadily for a long period.

The company had recently appealed to the chemicals and fertilisers
ministry to review a decision of drug price regulator NPPA to grant only
35% manufacturer’s margin, although the law provides for up to 50% of
the landed cost in the case of imported drugs.

NPPA gave a lower margin as it felt that cheaper substitutes are already
available in India. Novartis’ review petition also received some support
from the health ministry which initially thought the drug was unique.

Now, on detailed examination, the health ministry has found that some
substitutes exist in India and the view has been conveyed to NPPA,
sources told ET. The chemicals ministry has now sought the view in
writing so that it could endorse the maximum allowable post
manufacturing expense (MAPE) computed by NPPA, said a source.

Only Novartis had filed a review petition although a few other imported
MNC brands have been recently given less than 50% MAPE. The move
represents an emerging trend of regulatory intervention in the case of
costly imported drugs that pose a challenge to price regulation as the
government cannot go to the importer’s manufacturing site abroad and
find the actual cost of production to determine the margin.

Companies were sometimes accused of increasing the landed cost (cost of
imported drug including customs duty and clearing charges) of the drug
so that they could claim a higher manufacturer’s margin, which is not
more than half of the landed cost. Till recently, NPPA has been allowing
50% of the landed cost to cover selling and distribution expenses and
the importer’s profit.
