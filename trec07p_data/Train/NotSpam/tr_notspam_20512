7:40 AM, 6/19/07, Update: Shuttle crew gears up for undocking=20

The Atlantis astronauts are preparing to undock from the international spac=
e station this morning after a dramatic visit highlighted by installation o=
f a new set of solar arrays and recovery from major computer problems on th=
e lab complex.

"It's really exciting to see the station in this configuration," said Fligh=
t Director Holly Ridings. "I think we all feel like we've accomplished the =
mission objectives. ... There were certainly a lot of things to overcome, b=
ut in spite of all those surprises we managed to do what we always do and m=
eet our mission objectives and have a successful mission."

The space station has a new look with the retraction of the P6-2B solar pan=
el and installation of the new S3/S4 solar array truss segment on the right=
 side of the lab's main solar power truss. The station now sports two huge =
solar panels mounted on each end of the power truss, slowly rotating like g=
iant paddle wheels to track the sun.

Flight controllers will get a chance to take in the station's new look duri=
ng a one-lap fly-around by Atlantis after undocking to photograph the outpo=
st from different angles.

Flight controllers successfully tested the station's orientation control sy=
stem Monday to make sure revived computers in the Russian segment of the la=
b complex will be able to keep the outpost properly oriented after Atlantis=
 departs. There were no problems and while troubleshooting continues to fin=
d the original cause of the computer problems, engineers are confident the =
system is healthy.

"The international space station right now is in very, very good shape," Ri=
dings said. "The other thing we did yesterday was do our test on the Russia=
n thrusters, both with the (Russian) terminal computer controlling as the b=
rains of the operation and then the U.S. navigation computer controlling it=
. Both of those activities went nominal, there were no problems, no issues.

"We should expect it to work just fine today," she said. "We certainly stil=
l have a lot of work to do in terms of the root cause, but as far as gettin=
g everything back up and running, we're very, very comfortable those system=
s and processes are on line and running properly."

Undocking is expected at 10:42 a.m. Here is an updated timeline of today's =
activities (in EDT and mission elapsed time; includes rev. O of the NASA te=
levision schedule):
