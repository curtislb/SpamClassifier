A Perl string contains characters (not octets).
The codepoint U+263a is represented by the character "\x{263a}".
Whether that takes 1 or 2 or 3 or even more octets in the string,
shouldn't matter. Read perlunitut.

If you convert your data first to proper UTF-8, then the next steps are
far easier.

There are plenty of tools available to do that for you. I have never
looked for it, but I wouldn't be surprised that someone already did
exactly that: convert an e-mail message (including of course all encoded
header lines, and all MIME parts) to an UTF-8 version.

Did you look into SA "custom rules"? I find them quite easy to use.
