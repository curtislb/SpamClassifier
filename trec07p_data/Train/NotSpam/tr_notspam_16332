Hi,
I've been hoping for an affordable portable Linux system for some
time, especially if it has wireless networking and ethernet.  I hate
lugging a laptop; the dead weight of a screen is especially irksome.
PDAs with speech are overpriced.  Most seem to run Windows, with one
exception (the Pappenmeier device).

There's a group of people who are trying to turn a Linksys router into
a talking portable.  See www.louderlinux.net.  I wish them luck.

Does your "slug" device use an x86 processor?  That would make it
especially attractive.
