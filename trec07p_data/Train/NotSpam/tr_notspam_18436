Or even just

         sub addfriend {
            my ($self, $newfriend) = @_;
            # dereference the array from the hash
            push @{$self->{'_friends'}}, $newfriend;
         }

Just like you use () to make sure mathematical operators are applied 
the way you want you use {} to make sure dereferencing is done right.

You might also change the subroutine a little to allow for

  $obj->addfriend( 'Tom', 'Jenda')

like this:

         sub addfriend {
            my ($self, @newfriends) = @_;
            # dereference the array from the hash
            push @{$self->{'_friends'}}, @newfriends;
         }
