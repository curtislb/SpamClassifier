A couple of weeks ago I posted about resources on the history of copyleft.
This was for a presentation I was giving to future school librarians.
Several people expressed interest in my finished product. Should I send
that here or is there someplace else that would be better for that. Sorry,
I'm not sure what the proper courtesy is for this situation. It's a 10MB
powerpoint file.
