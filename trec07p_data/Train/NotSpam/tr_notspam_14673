Lou Dobbs Tonight
Wednesday, May 23, 2007

Tonight, we’ll be reporting on the threat to our country of
infectious diseases due to our wide open borders.

Members of the Catholic Church and pro-illegal immigration
reform groups announced a nationwide amnesty lobbying effort
today. The group sponsors a “tour of dreamers” where illegal
and legal immigrants from across the country travel by train to
Washington to meet with members of Congress regarding
immigration reform. The “dreamers” are also launching an
internet-based movement. We’ll have a full report.

The United States Department of Agriculture does not want
private U.S. businesses to test cows for mad cow disease,
saying there would be too many false positives. Meanwhile U.S.
beef producers want to test cattle to publicly certify their
beef for consumers. Join us tonight for a full report on why
the federal government is prohibiting private companies from
testing their beef.

The Supreme Court ruled Tuesday in support of employers in a
workplace discrimination suit because the employee had missed
the deadline for filing her discrimination lawsuit. Is the
180-day deadline fair? We’ll have more on that tonight.

The U.S. government has failed in attempt to reform our
immigration system with the same solution twice already. The
current Senate amnesty legislation evidences failure in the
part of our leaders to learn from history. Join us tonight for
a full examination of the 1986 amnesty debate. We’ll take a
look at what lessons Congress has and has not learned.	

Union leaders are outraged over the Senate’s amnesty
legislation. Critics say the bill will increasing the number of
visas granted to foreign high tech workers will virtually
eliminate incentives for college students to pursue degrees in
math and science. According to the U.S. Department of
Education, U.S. colleges and universities graduate more than
300,000 students with these degrees. We’ll have a special
report on how rapidly that number may decline.

President Bush has begun attacking opponents of his amnesty
agenda. One very vocal critic of that agenda, John Fonte,
senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, calls this so-called
comprehensive immigration reform "comprehensively bad." He
joins Lou.

latest commentary on how our leaders’ new immigration plans

Lou Dobbs lays out his manifesto to save the middle class in
his new book, “War on the Middle Class: How the Government, Big
Business, and Special Interest Groups Are Waging War on the
American Dream and How to Fight Back.” War on the Middle Class
is now on sale in bookstores near you and on Amazon.com and
BarnesandNoble.com.
