There's really two issues here: do you have the RTLD_XXX functionality
in dlopen, and do you have the #defines for it.

If you lack the functionality **and** if you depend on it rather than on
the defined default behavior, then you should refuse to use dlopen with
the wrong settings.  If you have the capability and merely lack the
#defines, you should create your own #defines.

If, on the third hand, the default behavior is what you wish (and
I don't know if it is), then you can safely refrain from using the
#defines and not have to think about the problem at all.  The latter
was something of a well-known "best practice" in the Unix of old (;-))
