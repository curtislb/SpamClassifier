Hello!

I was wondering if there is anyone on the list in or near Seattle, WA
USA who would be willing to bring their XO to our local Python
Interest Group (www.seapig.org) meeting? Several people at the last
meeting expressed an interest in starting to work on XO related
projects and it would be a great inspiration to see one in person.

The next meeting is this Thursday, the 19th.

Take care,
  -Brian
