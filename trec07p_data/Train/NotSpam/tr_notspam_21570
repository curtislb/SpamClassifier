It has been a while since I had to deal with Asian character sets, but
for Chinese and (I believe) Kanji (Japanese) each pictograph (character)
is a word, so no spaces are required. Katakana is the phonetic version
of Japanese, which may or may not have spaces between the words. I never
had to read them, only validate that the images in the service manuals
looked like what was being displayed or printed.
