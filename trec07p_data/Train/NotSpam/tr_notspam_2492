Lou Dobbs Tonight
Tuesday, April 17, 2007

Tonight, the massacre on the campus of Virginia Tech University
claimed the lives of 32 people. We’ll have the latest updates
on the worst school shooting in U.S. history. We’ll also have a
full report on the victims in this horrible tragedy.

Although there are no set patterns or warning signs of troubled
youth in America’s middle and high schools, Secret Service,
FBI, as well as private security associations and school
security groups attempt to identify “clues” to profile who
might put our schools at risk. We’ll have a special report.

We’ll also be taking a look at crime on college campuses. We’ll
examine the security measures that colleges and universities
have in place to protect students from rape, assault, and
shootings.

Rep. Tom Tancredo, whose district of Littleton, Colorado was at
the center of the horrific school killing years ago at
Columbine High School, issued a statement yesterday urging
Americans to be diligent and aware of possible copycat
incidents. Already two universities have been evacuated because
of various threats. How will the tragedy at Virginia Tech
affect security at campuses across the nation in the coming
days? We’ll have a full report.

There's a major election battle in Carpentersville, Illinois
over illegal immigration and a proposed ordinance cracking down
on it. That ordinance would make it a crime to hire, do
business with or rent housing to illegal aliens. We'll have a
special report on the fate of this ordinance.

And we’ll be joined by three of the nation's best radio talk
show hosts: Spie McIntyre, KABC in Los Angeles, Mark Riley, Air
America in New York and Steve Cochran, WGN in Chicago.
