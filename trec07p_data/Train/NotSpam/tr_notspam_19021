If I may..  when we scratch  the surface, I  think lots of people give
different meaning to the term "access to knowledge". Although I do not
share  nor condone the reasons   why  various countries  at WIPO  (and
elsewhere) do not want to use the term, I think we  might want to make
sure that even the proponents of A2K  have a true common understanding
of what the term ought to mean, and not just one that shifts according
to  the tactical opportunities  they are faced with  -  which is a bad
thing in and by itself, but might be  counter-productive in the remote
case we are ever in a position to plan in the *real* long term.

Or does this mean I am the only one that has some doubts on the actual
meaning of A2K?

Ciao,
