     Had a similar problem with my computer illiterate father.  I told
him that "the next time you break it, you have to fix it."  Luckily,
that got him off my system permanently.  I'd suggest a dual-boot system.
  One where he can select Windows, but can't boot Linux without a
password.  Unfortunately, you won't be able to see the lilo prompts.  I
know nothing about grub.  If you can handle that, he'll never be able to
trash your Linux partition.  Windows XP can take care of itself.
Personally, I'd set up a dual-boot system with password protected Linux,
and a DOS prompt.   Let him freakin' try using that.  That's bullcrapp, 
wrecking your computer just because he pays for the power.  If you have 
any income, tell him you'll pay for the computer's electrical use.  In 
any case, if he insists on breaking  the thing, insist that he effing
ix it if he wants to continue using it.  BTW, I use removable hard drive 
trays.  You can plug in one or the other at whim.  If you can afford 
twin hard drives, I'd go that way.  HTH,

         Michael
