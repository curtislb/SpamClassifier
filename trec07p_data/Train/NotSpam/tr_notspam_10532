Absolutely.

Commenting in a useful clear way I believe takes years to master.
Maintaining your own and other scripts will teach you the difference.
Note the following bad sample

# loop through each entry of the xyz table.
foreach my $key (sort keys xyz) {

It is also very important to document WITH your code.  Take the above
snippet and consider just changing the variable from non-specific to
problem domain, eg $key to $account.  It makes it clearer.

foreach my $account (sort keys xyz) {

Look to the code itself first, use real names and spell them in full.  I
have a production system where prefix is shortened to pfx, pref, prefx.
It is a nightmare to maintain.

Use paragraphing,  keep lines of code that go together with a blank line
above and below.

   something account related;
   
   something customer related;
   something else customer related;

   work out totals for the report;

Generally clearer code is more important than clearer comments.

Coding is a craft.  Simple to learn the basics, years of mastery to get
it right.
