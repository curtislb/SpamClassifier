     Okay.  I get the picture.  Perfect...if SpeakUp doesn't complain. 
Man, I love that interface.  Especially for laptop users.  Never did 
care for mice, and like my fingers glued to the home-row on the 
keyboard.  (asdf-jkl;)  The laptop config makes it even easier.  No 
hunting for the notches on the F and J keys.  If Kirk and Andy weren't 
such ugly looking women, I'd propose to 'em. <grins>  This is what a 
screen reader !should! be.  Dunno if I've seen it in X though.  Oralux 
kinda sounds like everything is in text mode, as far as the client list, 
anyway.  A friend at CVALE (Central Valley Area Linux Enthusiasts) also 
sent me a copy of Ubuntoo, I think.  Never got it working.
     I was thinking along the lines of the old Sound Blaster's "say" 
command for DOS, where you could have the computer say whatever.  Might 
also be nice to feed the synth's output back into the microphone and 
record things to mp3 or WAV format.  How well does SpeakUp work with 
bitchx, do you know?  Hanging out on openprojects was another bad habit 
i'd like to renew. <grins>  Thank you for the info.  You've all been an 
enormous help.

         Michael
