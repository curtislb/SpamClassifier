The whole point of free software is that it is "exempt from subjection
to the will of others". Your will does not impeed what I am able to do
to Free Software, even if you hold the copyright upon it.

Proprietary software is typically non-free, but the converse is not
true. There are many pieces of software which are non-free but are
decidedly not proprietary. Consider any of the pieces of software in
non-free for which the source code is available.

If we are to use it in that sense, then it is completely meaningless
in this discussion (unless you plan on distinguishing between PD and
non-PD works) as every single copyrightable work has a copyright
holder, and is therefore owned by a proprietor.

Because proprietary works are a subset of non-free works, a free work
cannot also be proprietary. However, a non-free work does not
necessarily have to be proprietary. This is why you should not use the
terms interchangeably.

This is the same reason why we talk about Free Software instead of
merely talking about Open Source Software: a piece of free software
cannot be closed, but an open work does not necessarily have to be
free.

Neither RMS nor the FSF use proprietary interchangeably with non-free
to the best of my knowledge. [At least, I've never heard RMS use it
that way.] And frankly, even if they did, it wouldn't make their usage
correct.

Feel free to provide citations to back up your claims, though.
