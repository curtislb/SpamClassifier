Ahhh, I'm starting to breathe easier (uh, "more easily" for the grammar 
police).

Ahhh, so I'm not alone in this!

And, IIRC, that was exactly why my POD for List::Compare was judged to 
be of low "kwalitee."

Well, I think it should be given serious consideration.  The tests I 
have in 'make buildtools_tests' do not run during 'make test' and, in 
fact, they're not intended to do so.  So perhaps this is another such case.

(Coincidentally, one of the things I'm going to argue for in my talk at 
YAPC is a more fine-grained concept of which tests should be run when.)

To tell the truth, I'm not that familiar with Parrot's t/harness or with 
that variable in particular.  I'll have to take a look.

Thank you very much.
