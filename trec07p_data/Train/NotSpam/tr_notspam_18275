Lou Dobbs Tonight
Monday June 11, 2007

Tonight, President Bush lands in the United States following a
European trip, and he’s flying back into a political maelstrom.
Between Iraq and immigration, the president’s under fire on a
variety of issues. But he claims the so-called comprehensive
immigration reform bill is not dead yet – does he have the
political capital to make it work?

The RAND Corp. held a briefing today to discuss its predictions
on China’s military buildup, which they say will outstrip the
U.S. military within the next decade. Their recent risk
assessment report on China raises the specter of an aggressive
military strategy that could be used against other countries in
the region and maybe the U.S. military. We’ll have that
shocking report tonight.

Nearly a third of the country is currently experiencing
drought. From Florida to Southern California, we’ll take a look
at the extent of the problem and compare it to recent years.

Lou Dobbs Tonight will continue to report on Congress’ and
President Bush’s efforts to revive the stalled immigration
bill. And Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri joins us
tonight: The Senator will tell us why she chose to vote against
the proposed amnesty bill and why she thinks the answer to the
illegal immigration crisis can be found if we follow the law
and follow the money.

The President of a local Arizona chapter of the National Border
Patrol says simply, "amnesty does not work." Edward "Bud"
Tuffly is demanding that someone in Congress explain why he and
his colleagues continue to risk their lives on the border when
the illegals will be given amnesty in the end. Tuffly joins us
tonight.

And Genarlow Wilson was considered a star athlete and
well-respected student in his Georgia community, but all that
changed when he was convicted of aggravated child molestation.
Wilson was serving an 11-year prison term for consensual sex
with a 15-year-old girl when he was 17-years-old. But Wilson
was granted his release today, after two years of advocates and
lawyers trying to gain his freedom. Is this a happy ending?
