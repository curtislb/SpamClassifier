Ryan, here are several thoughts based on the=20
questions you raised.  Apologies for a delay,=20
I've been preparing a tenure package and that has=20
dominated all other tasks.    Your set of issues=20
around NonCommercial and Commercial licenses raise multiple follow up ideas!

I think you've nailed one of the biggest=20
problems.  In fact, it seems there are related=20
two sub-problems.  One is hold-up from a single=20
owner -- in this case the (c) holder -- who will=20
want to negotiate for a chunk of value.  The=20
other is the cleverness of the idea can be lost=20
if you try to negotiate and accidentally disclose it.

Either way, I agree that these 2 kinds of risk=20
discourage a person from making any kind of investment beforehand.

One possibility that I like a lot is to use a=20
default menu.  That is, suppose the license has an offer of the following=
 form:

If you make $x amount of money, then contribute=20
y% of revenue to the original work.
If you make $(x+d) amount of money, then=20
contribute (y+n)% of revenue to the original work.
etc.

Alternatively,

If you keep your piece closed for x years, then=20
contribute y% of revenue to the original work.
If you keep your piece closed for (x+d) years,=20
then contribute (y+n)% of revenue to the original work.
etc.

This set of default options lets the person=20
writing the derivative work choose based on a fairly clear set of terms.

This idea is pretty interesting.  I see at two=20
possible concerns.  (1) Is that there is still=20
some uncertainty over what the final % will=20
be.  I agree it seems that the "community,"=20
however defined, is likely to be more neutral in=20
assessing value but there is still some lack of=20
clarity beforehand. (2) Have you thought about=20
how large a community you need?  If it's very=20
small, there may be too few voters to establish a=20
meaningful baseline so there might be a need to build the community first.

Overall, this idea sounds quite useful.  A good=20
reputation system can be used to "rate the rater"=20
and help ensure integrity in the review process.

This "information revelation" mechanism looks=20
like it should require a subsidy i.e. some means=20
of compensating the raters for their time and=20
effort.  If done well, it could be covered out of=20
the revenues generated by the pool of derivative works themselves.

Another form of information disclosure mechanism=20
could be to have people who actually download the=20
derivative work themselves state what % of value=20
the new piece adds.  This is harder to "fake"=20
since someone must actually pay for the good (so=20
if you're going to stuff a ballot box it's going=20
to be costly).  It's also unbiased because the=20
person doing the buying is not independent of the person doing the rating.

This is also an excellent point.  It has long=20
been an established tenet of economics that more=20
complete information leads to greater efficiency=20
in production.  Such a system should be as transparent as possible.

Note also that it should also align incentives=20
the right way e.g. no one should have a reason to=20
misrepresent their rating, and the raters' votes=20
should correspond closely to the consumers' reasons for buying.

There is some good discussion on the Free=20
Software Business (fsb) discussion group but=20
aside from that, I've found very little on this=20
topic.  Thanks for raising some interesting issues.
