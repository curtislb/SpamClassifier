i Janina,

Yes, I will be taking into consideration your guidelines posted in the 
how-to when I reinstall Linux, especially with the partitions as you 
suggested.  I hope the speakup issue gets fixed as well, glad I'm not 
the only one experiencing weird issues with the Dectalk Express.

Take care and thanks again,

Beth
