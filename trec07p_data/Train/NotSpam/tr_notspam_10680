I'm not qualified to comment on the technical merits of a kernel vs. a 
user-space solution, but I know that from a maintenance point of view we 
would prefer it.

More importantly, this is the kind of forward thinking I would like to 
see more of in the access community. Over the next couple of years we 
will increasingly move over to ultra-mobile technologies. These will 
require lean kernels but there is scope for many options in user-space. 
Ubuntu is working actively with Intel on these new platform to make sure 
accessibility is a consideration from the very start. Hopefully we can 
avoid the long accessibility gap we had with mobile phones.
