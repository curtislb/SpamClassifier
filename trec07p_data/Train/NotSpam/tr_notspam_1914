yYou want to download the vmware server program...install it, create a 
new virtual machine, specify linux as the OS and choose a specific 
distribution from the list, or the closest choice it gives you, then 
go into vm->settings and add a serial port to the hardware, and make 
sure the cd-rom drive is pointing to the drive you want to install 
from, or an iso image, and boot the vm.  Use control-g to grab input 
and allow you to use the vm, and control-alt to release input.
