4:38 PM PM, 6/6/07, Update: Spacewalk ends; ethernet cable, debris panels i=
nstalled

Space station commander Fyodor Yurchikhin and Oleg Kotov began repressurizi=
ng the Pirs airlock and docking module at 4:00 p.m. to officially close out=
 a five-hour 37-minute spacewalk.

The spacewalk began at 10:23 a.m. After replacing a hull-mounted science ex=
periment package, the cosmonauts routed a long ethernet cable along the out=
side of the Russian Zarya module that ultimately will permit computer comma=
nds to be sent from the U.S. section of the station to Russian control syst=
ems. They then turned their attention to installing 12 micrometeoroid debri=
s panels on the front end of the Zvezda command module.

Moving through space at 5 miles per second, the station - and spacewalkers =
- are vulnerable to collisions with space debris. That point was brought ho=
me today when the cosmonauts reported an apparent impact site on the statio=
n.

"How interesting. What an interesting hole," one spacewalker said through a=
 translator.

"Where?"

"Well see, this is not a hole but a dent from a meteorite."

A few moments later, one of the spacewalkers reported to mission control: "=
We found a dent or a hole from a meteorite, it looks like a bullet hole."

"Is it on the pressurized adapter?" a flight controller asked.

The reply from space was garbled, but one of the cosmonauts added, "I want =
to say the size is about five to six millimeters."

This was the 83rd spacewalk devoted to station assembly and maintenance sin=
ce construction began in 1998 and the second for Yurchikhin and Kotov, push=
ing their Expedition 15 total to 11 hours and two minutes. Overall all, sta=
tion astronauts and cosmonauts have logged 509 hours and five minutes of EV=
A time since assembly began.
