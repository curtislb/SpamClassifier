Well, I did suggest that "openfile" and "opendir" exist alongside
"open", with "openfile" being more akin to Perl 5's "open" or
"sysopen", and "open" being a bit more dwimmy.

But in general, most of the differences that you mention are things
that ought to be addressed in the resulting iterators, not in the
creating statement.  No, a "directory handle" will not behave exactly
like a "file handle".  But then, a file handle doesn't behave exactly
like "standard in" or "standard out", either (last I checked, Perl 5
won't do anything useful if you say "seek STDIN, 0, SEEK_END").
