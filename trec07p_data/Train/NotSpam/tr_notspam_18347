10:22 PM, 6/11/07, Update: Spacewalk ends; all objectives met; solar array =
extension on tap Tuesday=20

Astronauts Jim Reilly and Danny Olivas successfully hooked up a $367 millio=
n set of solar arrays today, routing power to the new truss segment, releas=
ing numerous launch locks, installing braces and rotating the array caniste=
rs into their normal position for deployment Tuesday.

They also released latches allowing a folding radiator panel to extend as r=
equired.

The spacewalk, the 84th devoted to station assembly and maintenance, starte=
d at 4:02 p.m. and ended at 10:17 p.m. for a duration of six hours and 15 m=
inutes, boosting the cumulative space station EVA time to 515 hours and 20 =
minutes. Three more spacewalks are planned: Wednesday, Friday and Sunday.

"Hey, thanks for the help on the ground, you guys," Reilly radioed from the=
 Quest airlock module.

Reilly and Olivas got off to a late start, delayed about an hour when fligh=
t controllers had to reset the station's stabilizing gyroscopes. But once o=
utside the Quest airlock, the spacewalkers sailed through a long list of so=
lar array outfitting tasks with no major problems. All their major objectiv=
es were met.
