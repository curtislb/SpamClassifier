Since you don't have a real serial port you  might not be able to do 
	linux console=/dev/ttyS0
And even if you replace that with
	linux console=/dev/ttyUSB0
It works only if the usb subsystem is installed and agetty is running for
/dev/ttyUSB0 which it probably is not.

Serial console installs are great, when you actually have a real hardware
port using IRQs 3 or 4, port addresses 2F8 or 3F8. 

I'm trying to get a PCMCIA serial port working for a serial install, and it
works fine with brltty but not with redirecting the console, and it won't
work with speakup of course.
