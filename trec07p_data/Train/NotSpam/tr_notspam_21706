I have had to access important files, even copy them out when XP fails, one 
can even do a scan from DOS if need be.
I have always installed XP on a FAT32 partition.
In fact, when I get the chance to pull the back-up drive from my laptop's 
hidden partition, I will probably re-format it FAT32 and re-install.
As far as encryption, who cares about that?
I have a home computer, and I don't imagine anyone hacking my system.
I have a router for a firewall.
If it were a work computer, I would be concerned about encryption.

If you do that, then you won't have access to some of xp's features,
such as encryption, which rely on ntfs. Also, I don't see how having a
dos floppy to access the drive would help here, care to elaborate?
