Hi Ted,
My experience with this some years ago was in anti-aliasing visual 
stimuli presented on a PC monitor. The intended line was calculated 
pixel by pixel and the each pixel that the line touched was assigned a 
value based on a sawtooth function. The peak of the function was always 
exactly on the intended line and the luminance of the pixel was a linear 
function of the distance of its center along a perpendicular to the 
line. We used the width of a pixel as the lateral extent of the function 
with adequate success. The lines appeared smooth until the viewer could 
resolve the individual pixels. Wider lines used a trapezoidal 
distribution of luminance with the same slope on the limbs. I must note 
that we did not have to create our stimuli in real time, and this method 
might be too slow. However, I am fairly certain that if the function 
knew about the characteristics of the output device, one could base a 
curveto function on this.

Jim
