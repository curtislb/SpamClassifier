Museum to install talking CCTV

Talking CCTV cameras could be introduced at one of the Black Country's top
tourist attractions, it was revealed today.

The Black Country Living Museum would be the first place in Dudley borough
to install the new crimebusting Big Brother devices in a modern attempt to
solve an age-old problem.

Moves to beef up security at the museum in Tipton Road comes after an arson
attack on a builders' shed and the theft of a dog after a visitor's car was
broken into within less than a week.

A security guard at the site would be able to shout warnings through a
speaker attached to the camera if anyone was spotted misbehaving.

MOA Security Protects, Preserves

Sgt. Randy O'Hara and Andrew Cobabe, student security supervisor at the
Museum of Art, show their "challenge coins," used to add fun and enhance
morale on the job.By Lindsay Cusworth
11 Apr 2007


To protect artwork from being stolen, security guards are strategically
placed on all floors of the Museum of Art and alarmed detectors are
positioned near valuable paintings. Multiple cameras, moved around based on
need, also keep watch over the museum's treasures. 

But theft is not security's biggest worry; it's damage from patrons.

"We have had problems with groups and unintentional damage," said Randy
O'Hara, security coordinator at the museum. "We had a group with crayons and
they got too close to the artwork before the security could get to them."

O'Hara said no serious harm was caused to the painting at that time, but
when there is a situation of intentional damage, the student guards will
contact the university police. 

"The biggest problem we have is people touching the artwork," said Emily
Poulsen, registrar at the museum. "They are usually innocent people who
don't realize the damage in touching a painting. We have finger prints on
almost everything that we take down."

Poulsen really understands the lengthy process of setting up a new exhibit
and sending one off when its run is over. After all, it's her job to oversee
both activities.

The artwork arrives in crates that need to acclimatize for a time period
ranging from a couple of days to two weeks. After the artwork is taken out
of the crates, a detailed condition report is recorded. The report shows any
damages made prior to arrival. 

Each painting is insured for its fair market value. The museum gets each
painting insured while it is in transit and during its stay at the museum. 

"We are responsible for the work while it is here," Poulsen said. "If a work
is damaged while it is here, then the museum is liable."

Poulsen said the museum has tried many tactics to encourage people to not
touch. A small sign is located next to a handful of paintings reminding
visitors "Please do not touch the artwork." At one point, metal bars were
placed in front of valuable paintings, but they were taken down for safety
reasons. 

Recently, for the Paths to Impressionism exhibit, museum staff started
putting sandpaper tape on the floor 18 inches in front of paintings to
signify how far away a visitor should stand. 

"We researched it and found that the tape is effective," Poulsen said. "It
mentally keeps people at a distance away from the works of art. It also
helps the guards so they can show people where they can stand."

The guards at the museum are an entire staff of students who are trained to
be "eyes and ears." Their job is to circulate through the exhibits and to
enforce the rules. 

"Enforcing the rules is sometimes an awkward thing because the security
guards have to tell visitors in a public space that they are doing something
wrong," said Chris Wilson, marketing and communications manager at the
museum. "We hope our visitors realize that when a security guard asks a
person to step back from a painting that it's nothing personal. They are
just trying to protect valuable works that many people have made great
efforts to preserve in their current condition."

Security is an important part of the overall operation of the museum. Wilson
said between the cameras installed throughout the museum and the security
guards patrolling the galleries, the museum staff is confident the works are
safe and well protected.

"Every time we host a traveling exhibition and every time we borrow a work
from another institution we are evaluated on how well we care for the
artworks that have been entrusted to us," Wilson said. "It is important to
us to care for these artworks because these other places trust us to care
for and safeguard them. If we don't do everything in our power to keep their
works safe, we would find that nobody would want to lend works to us."

Museum security is an issue everywhere, and other art museums in Utah Valley
and the Salt Lake area are implementing their own security measures.

Vern Swanson, director of the Springville Museum of Art, said there are two
major problems when it comes to protecting the artwork at his museum: adult
women and children. 

"The women bang on the paintings with their handbags," Swanson said. "They
back up into the painting and damage it. And none of them know it is
happening."

In response to this problem, Swanson puts up rope in front of a handful of
paintings and requires all people with backpacks and purses to carry them on
their stomachs.

"We also don't allow children into the museum without an adult supervisor,"
Swanson said.

But even with adult supervisors present, Swanson said not a day goes by
without seeing a group of young children playing hide-and-go-seek in the
museum.

"We are the art Nazis," Swanson said. "The art is a living document to our
cultural heritage, and it cannot take care of itself."

Bonnie Souliere, operations manager at the Utah Museum of Fine Arts at the
University of Utah, agreed that patrons touching the paintings is a problem
at that museum as well.

"People don't realize that they get too close to the painting," Souliere
said. "Our staff is reminded to monitor their surroundings and to act if
they see something."

Iraq Museum plunder commemorated
By Haydar Baderqghan

Azzaman, April 12, 2007


The Ministry of Archaeology and Terrorism has described the looting of Iraq
Museum four years ago and shortly after U.S. troops landed in Baghdad as "a
tragedy."
In a statement issued to mark the fourth anniversary of the Museum's looting
as U.S. invasion troops looked on, the ministry said that 7,000 pieces were
still missing.
Looters and plunderers entered the museum, broke its glass cases and
contents and took thousands of magnificent Mesopotamian relics away.
The looting started on April 11, 2003, only two days after the U.S.
occupation of Baghdad, and continued for three days in which most of the
items on display, numbering at least 15,000 pieces were either destroyed or
stolen.
"The Museum passed through really difficult times at the hands of thieves,
gangs and smugglers . The looting of the museum will remain a testimony for
the barbarism of wars and their destructive outcome," said the statement.
Of the 15,000 missing items, 4,000 have been retrieved by the museum and
4,000 more were confiscated by customs officials in neighboring countries.
The statement said the ministry was trying to have the items still held by
other countries returned to the museum.

A fine mess: Bandit burgles plaque of Ness
Thursday, April 12, 2007
Gabriel Baird
Plain Dealer Reporter

A thief has burglarized the most unlikely place, the headquarters of the 
Cleveland police.

The bandit selected the ultimate prize for insulting the very notion of 
justice: a bronze plaque picturing the man who may be the city's best 
crime- fighter of all time and certainly the city's most widely known 
lawman: Eliot Ness.

Ness made his name in Prohibition-era Chicago by successfully 
prosecuting notorious gangster Al "Scarface" Capone in 1931.

Kevin Costner played him in "The Untouchables" movie in 1987. Ness came 
to Cleveland in the 1930s to be the city's public safety director after 
his stint in Chicago.

Although the plaque was housed in the police station, it didn't take any 
"Mission: Impossible" acrobatics to grab it and run.

Worth about $225 in cash but much more in sentimental value, the plaque 
was in the police museum on the first floor of the Justice Center. 
Visitors don't have to go through a security check to get into the 
museum, which is operated not by the Police Department, but by the 
Cleveland Police Historical Society.

Volunteers staff the museum and guide visitors through antique police 
uniforms, photographs and relics of policing technology past. But they 
are not trained to detect crime.

When it was first noticed that the bronze on walnut plaque was missing 
from the Wall of Fame, museum volunteers didn't report it stolen. They 
thought perhaps someone had borrowed the local treasure. After all, at 
times the museum does lend out its materials.

Thefts are infrequent at the police museum. But some years back, an 
antique badge was stolen. It was recovered.

A blurb asking for help finding the plaque recently ran in the 
Vindicator, the newsletter of the Fraternal Order of Police. Then, the 
missing plaque came to the attention of the police chief.

Sgt. Daniel Fay, a Cleveland police spokesman, said a theft report was 
expected to be filed with police Wednesday. Once it is reported as a 
crime, a suspect could be charged with breaking and entering, a felony. 
If a police report is filed, it is likely to be assigned to Third 
District detectives.

First place the police will look: eBay.

Police Search for Stolen Faberge Eggs

VIENNA, Austria ? Authorities said Thursday they hope DNA tests and 
fingerprint analysis will help track down the thieves who stole up to $1 
million worth of Faberge eggs and other artworks from a Vienna palace.

Police Maj. Manfred Briegl of Vienna's criminal investigations division 
told reporters that police still had no leads in the theft, which was 
discovered Wednesday afternoon at the Palais Harrach, a Baroque-era 
mansion that now houses offices and shops.

Briegl said detectives dusted for fingerprints and collected possible 
traces of the thieves for DNA analysis in their effort to recover the 30 
Faberge eggs, 20 porcelain vases and a painting, and that results were 
expected within a week.

He said the owner of the artworks, whose name was not released, 
estimated their total value at between $805,000 and $1 million.

Gerald Hesztera, spokesman for the Federal Criminal Investigations 
Bureau said Vienna police gave Interpol a detailed list of the stolen 
items in case they surface in auctions or black markets outside Austria.

Police said the works were stolen sometime between Tuesday evening and 
Wednesday morning by thieves who broke through a rear entrance and 
apparently loaded the items into a waiting vehicle.

Werner Mayer, an official with the UNIQA insurance company, told 
Austrian television the building was not fitted with an alarm system and 
suggested the insurer was, therefor, not legally obligated to cover the 
theft.

New rule may help Native American tribes reclaim artifacts

Kevin Livelli
Columbia News Service
Apr. 12, 2007 08:58 AM
It's been nearly a dozen years since museums and federal agencies had to 
notify American Indian tribes about artifacts in their collections that 
might have been stolen from or lost by the tribes. But a new federal 
regulation may make it easier for the tribes to identify such objects.

It was a hot and arid day in Pecos, N.M., when the elders and leaders of 
the Jemez Pueblo tribe welcomed an outsider into the fold: archaeologist 
William Whatley.

Wearing colorful headbands, the old men sat down on the ground with 
Whatley. Then they began drawing images in the dust--images of bones, 
masks and pottery that had gone missing or been looted from the tribe. 
The elders implored Whatley to use his scientific knowledge to find the 
objects and help return them to the tribe. Not an easy task.

That was nearly 20 years ago. Now, for other tribes searching for lost 
or stolen items, the process may get a lot easier.

In mid-March, the Department of the Interior's National NAGPRA program, 
which helps carry out the Native American Graves Protection and 
Repatriation Act, announced a regulation requiring museums, universities 
and federal agencies in possession of Native American art and artifacts 
to provide new lists of their inventories and to share them with all 
federally recognized tribes within six months.

The rule, which takes effect April 20, marks the first time in a dozen 
years that museums and federal agencies have had to share with tribes 
what's in their collections. This process may uncover many items missing 
for years, and it may make encourage tribes to start making repatriation 
claims to get their artifacts back.

Repatriation is a process frequently fraught with tension between 
museums and tribes. Curators and scholars have an interest in preserving 
items for their educational and research value. For the tribes, 
reclaiming their objects can have a spiritual and cultural significance. 
But for some, it can lead to big business. A reclaimed object can 
establish a tribe's right to land, which it might want to 
develop--sometimes into a casino.

"This promises to have a big impact for many tribes, especially those 
recently recognized by the federal government," said Dr. Rayna Green, a 
Cherokee and the curator and director of the American Indian program at 
the Smithsonian Institution. "And it's not just about cultural heritage. 
It's about money and land and property. This is America, after all."

Yet even if the new rule helps tribes find many sacred objects, it won't 
necessarily help them overcome the many obstacles inherent in the 
repatriation process.

"Tribes and museums approach decisions about sacred objects carefully," 
said Dr. Timothy McKeown, the senior program coordinator at the NAGPRA 
office and the man responsible for overseeing the entire repatriation 
process. "Repatriation is not just something you can do overnight."

To begin with, tribes can struggle with issues of confidentiality when 
filing a claim. Many tribes, especially the Pueblo groups in the 
Southwest, have strict customs and rules about sharing tribal 
information with outsiders. Yet the law requires a tribe to reasonably 
establish its historical connection to a particular object.

The Pueblo Indians of San Eldefanso made a claim in the mid-1990s but 
backed away when a dispute over the claim led to litigation in federal 
court. They didn't want to have to testify and reveal tribal secrets.

Even putting together the claim can be a challenge. In many instances, a 
tribe's spoken language--like that of the Jemez Pueblo--isn't written 
down and can't be easily transferred into the legalese necessary to file 
a claim. And hiring lawyers costs money, something many smaller tribes lack.

When claims are readied for filing, McKeown says tribes sometimes argue 
among themselves and with neighboring tribes over who has the right to 
proceed with that claim, who should act as spokesman and who will be 
responsible for the objects once they return.

One such case currently under review by McKeown's office involves 
funerary objects and human remains that were recently found in Chaco 
Canyon National Park in New Mexico. Representatives from Pueblo, Navajo 
and Hopi tribes have all made competing claims for the same objects.

The tribes' competing claims can stir feuds that go back hundreds of 
years. "It has to do with very old notions of clan and kinship and 
philosophical and religious ideas about death and the afterlife," Green 
said.

"The issue is important because what you and I call artifacts are in 
their worlds living tribal members with the same rights as people," 
Whatley said.

Once objects are successfully returned to tribes, one serious issue 
frequently remains. Many of the items belonging to tribes in the 
Iroquois Six Nations and the Hopi Nation are perishable--cornhusk masks 
or headdresses with feathers. When these items come into a museum's 
collection, they are often sprayed with arsenic or another pesticide for 
preservation.

But upon return, the masks and headdresses are often worn in ceremonies, 
endangering the lives of tribal members and leaving the museum 
potentially liable for any resulting injury or illness.

"That's something we in the museum world are trying to remedy," Green 
said. "We're looking now into alternative means of preservation, like 
flash freezing objects."

Though the path to repatriation may take many years, Whatley says the 
end result will be worth the trouble for tribes. Over nine years, he has 
helped return thousands of objects to the Pueblo Jemez from museums 
around the country.

Back in dusty Pecos, thousands of Indians gathered in 1999 to welcome 
home their "tribal members." Museum curators and staff were on hand too, 
watching from a respectful distance.

Whatley, however, was by then a special guest of the tribe and had 
special access. He said he felt something that day that transcended 
science, money, land and all his pre-existing notions about Native 
American culture.

The experience, he said, has stayed with him and opened his eyes to a 
new way of looking at life.

"There's a lot more to this on the spiritual side than many non-Indians 
realize," he said.

Egipto reclama 17 piezas arqueol?gicas al Museo Egipcio de Barcelona
egipto-espa?a 12-04-2007

Egipto ha reclamado al Museo Egipcio de Barcelona un total de 17 piezas 
expuestas en sus salas, y asegura que ha llevado el caso incluso a 
instancias judiciales catalanas, dijo a Efe un alto funcionario de la 
arqueolog?a egipcia.

Ibrahim Abdul Maguid, director del sector de antig?edades recuperadas 
del Consejo Supremo de Antig?edades, asegur? que una arque?loga espa?ola 
que hab?a trabajado en el Museo Egipcio en Barcelona inform? a la 
Fiscal?a catalana de que las 17 piezas, adem?s de una estatua antigua, 
hab?an sido robadas a Egipto.

A su vez, la Fiscal?a avis? a la Embajada egipcia en Espa?a, agreg? Maguid.

El a?o pasado, el Consejo Supremo de Antig?edades, en colaboraci?n con 
la Embajada egipcia, nombr? a un abogado para que presentara una 
reclamaci?n ante la justicia espa?ola para lograr la 'repatriaci?n' de 
las 17 piezas.

Seg?n Maguid, una enviada del Museo Egipcio de Barcelona visit? El Cairo 
para expresar el deseo de su instituci?n de entregar la estatua a las 
autoridades egipcias, 'pero sin decir nada sobre las otras piezas... 
como si fuera para distraer la atenci?n sobre ellas', coment? el arque?logo.

Despu?s de iniciarse el proceso judicial, el Museo Egipcio de Barcelona 
volvi? a expresar su deseo de negociar la entrega de las piezas, siempre 
seg?n Maguid.

'Yo no s? si aquella arque?loga espa?ola que inform? del robo de las 
piezas lo hizo por sus diferencias con el Museo Egipcio de Barcelona o 
por su afici?n a las antig?edades. Lo importante es que vamos a 
recuperar nuestros restos', insisti? el experto.

Pese a que Maguid entiende que el Museo de Barcelona prefiere negociar 
este asunto, ?l insiste en que no se desplazar? a Espa?a hasta que esa 
entidad env?e fotograf?as e informaciones sobre las 17 piezas en litigio.

Parad?jicamente, el Consejo Supremo de Antig?edades egipcio reconoce que 
no sabe nada acerca de las piezas que reclama.

Pero s? sabe algo sobre la estatua, cuyo regreso a Egipto fue negociado 
el a?o pasado por el propio Museo Egipcio de Barcelona, pero que todav?a 
se encuentra en Espa?a.

Se trata de una pieza de piedra caliza coloreada, que data de la V 
dinast?a fara?nica, de entre 2.465 y 2.323 antes de Cristo.

La estatua, de 43,5 cent?metros de altura y en buen estado, seg?n 
Maguid, fue sustra?da durante las excavaciones realizadas en los a?os 
noventa del siglo XX por el arque?logo egipcio Abdel Munem Abu Bakr en 
la zona de Giza, al suroeste de El Cairo.

Al parecer, es la gemela de una estatua de mujer identificada como 
Nefrat ('guapa' en el lenguaje jerogl?fico) que se encuentra en El Cairo.

Sin embargo, el Museo Egipcio de Barcelona, a trav?s de su abogado, 
Ildefonso Falcones, asegur? hoy que 'el Consejo de Antig?edades de 
Egipto no se ha puesto en contacto con nosotros en relaci?n a ninguna 
pieza'.

Adem?s, dijo que una ex empleada del museo, descontenta con una 
indemnizaci?n que hab?a solicitado tras dejar su trabajo, comenz? a 
denunciar p?blicamente que 17 piezas de sus fondos eran de procedencia 
ilegal.

Seg?n el abogado, la Fiscal?a investig? esta denuncia y el Juzgado de 
Instrucci?n n?mero 29 de Barcelona dict? dos autos firmes en los que 'se 
establece que las obras son propiedad del museo y que fueron importadas 
legalmente en Espa?a'.

Pese a todo, el Museo Egipcio de Barcelona se mostr? dispuesta a 
devolver cualquier pieza 'si nos acreditan que sali? ilegalmente de 
Egipto, aunque eso sucediera hace sesenta o setenta a?os'.

La recuperaci?n de las antig?edades que han salido de Egipto de manera 
ilegal forma parte de una agresiva campa?a que ha lanzado el Ministerio 
de Cultura egipcio para recuperar miles de piezas robadas.

Les ?uvres vol?es aux juifs ravivent de mauvais souvenirs au Pays-Bas
LE MONDE | 12.04.07 | 15h11  ?  Mis ? jour le 12.04.07 | 16h35
Bruxelles Correspondant

'affaire des ?uvres d'art confisqu?es aux juifs pendant la seconde 
guerre mondiale ne passe d?cid?ment pas aux Pays-Bas. Parce qu'elle met 
? mal l'image du royaume o? l'on aima longtemps faire croire que la 
population s'?tait, plus qu'ailleurs, mobilis?e en faveur des juifs, 
mais probablement aussi parce qu'elle offre une sombre image du march? 
de l'art n?erlandais ? l'?poque de l'Occupation.

Mardi 3 avril, on a appris que l'Association n?erlandaise des mus?es 
allait coordonner une nouvelle enqu?te afin de d?terminer si, dans les 
collections nationales, ne figuraient pas d'?uvres dont des juifs 
auraient ?t? oblig?s de se d?faire entre 1933 et 1940. Une autre 
investigation, dont les r?sultats furent publi?s en 2000, avait d?j? 
tent? de d?terminer si les mus?es n'avaient pas acquis, entre 1940 et 
1948, des ?uvres confisqu?es par les nazis.

Les r?sultats des nouvelles recherches d?pendront, cette fois encore, de 
la bonne volont? des mus?es, qui d?cident seuls de ce qu'ils r?v?lent ou 
non. Danielle Lokin, pr?sidente de l'Association des mus?es, dit compter 
sur "leur ?thique professionnelle" et affirme que rien ne l'autorise ? 
penser qu'on lui cachera des choses.

L'annonce de cette enqu?te officielle est survenue alors qu'un autre 
?pisode suscite la col?re des organisations juives et de certains 
sp?cialistes mondiaux du march? de l'art. C'est mercredi 4 avril, en 
effet, que s'est termin? le d?lai pendant lequel les h?ritiers pr?sum?s 
de juifs spoli?s pouvaient introduire des demandes afin de r?cup?rer 
leurs biens. Une Commission de restitution a examin? jusqu'ici une 
quarantaine de requ?tes et r?pondu favorablement dans les trois quarts 
des cas. Les h?ritiers du banquier juif Max Rothstein ont, par exemple, 
r?cup?r? le Paysage au troupeau pr?s d'une mare, de Jacob Ruysdael, qui 
avait servi ? payer le voyage de la famille vers les Etats-Unis, en 
1941. Une trentaine d'autres demandes doivent encore ?tre trait?es.

DEMANDE DE PROLONGATION

Quelque 4 500 objets confisqu?s aux Pays-Bas ont ?t? retrouv?s apr?s 
1945, en Allemagne, et ont ?t? transf?r?s vers les administrations ou 
les mus?es n?erlandais. Confront? aux demandes de prolongation du d?lai 
imparti pour les demandes de restitution, le minist?re de la culture 
assure que d'autres dossiers pourront ?tre introduits et seront trait?s 
par une nouvelle commission ad hoc. L'ind?pendance de cette nouvelle 
instance est toutefois mise en doute. Comme, d'ailleurs, l'inventaire 
originel ?tabli par les mus?es, sans doute peu d?sireux de se d?faire de 
certaines ?uvres qu'ils avaient parfois restaur?es ? grands frais.

Les doutes ? l'endroit de certaines institutions sont renforc?s par les 
souvenirs du comportement de certains de leurs dirigeants pendant la 
guerre. Dirk Hanema, directeur du Mus?e Boijmans van Beuningen ? 
Rotterdam, et Willi Martin, responsable du Mauritshuis de La Haye, 
collabor?rent avec l'occupant. Tout comme Piet De Boer, pr?sident de 
l'Association des marchands d'art n?erlandais. Cette p?riode a ?t? 
marqu?e par d'autres sombres ?pisodes comme le d?mant?lement des 
collections Schloss, Stodel et celle du banquier Franz Koenigs. Une 
partie de la fabuleuse collection de Jacques Goudstikker ? 1 300 ?uvres 
? fut revendue aux nazis ? l'initiative de proches collaborateurs de ce 
flamboyant marchand et m?c?ne, mort accidentellement en 1941, sur le 
bateau qui le conduisait en Grande-Bretagne.

Cette injustice-l? a ?t? r?par?e en 2006 seulement, quand l'Etat rendit 
? l'h?riti?re de M. Goudstikker quelque deux cents tableaux dont une 
partie sera prochainement mise en vente ? Londres, Amsterdam et New 
York. Le Mauritshuis, le Mus?e Boijmans et le Bonnefanten (Maastricht) 
durent rendre, au total, une trentaine de tableaux de ma?tres.

Satellite TV host guilty in bogus artwork scam
Kristine Eubanks admits to conspiracy and tax evasion in scheme that 
defrauded customers of more than $20 million.
 >From the Associated Press
April 11, 2007

A satellite TV show host has pleaded guilty to federal charges stemming 
from an investigation into bogus artwork sold through televised auctions 
that defrauded customers of more than $20 million.

Kristine Eubanks, 49, of La Ca?ada Flintridge pleaded guilty Monday in a 
Los Angeles courtroom to one count each of conspiracy and tax evasion. 
She faces up to 10 years in prison when she is sentenced Sept. 24, 
prosecutors said.

Eubanks' husband, Gerald Sullivan, 51, pleaded guilty April 2 to one 
count each of conspiracy and failing to file tax returns. He faces up to 
six years in prison at sentencing in September.

Authorities said the couple acknowledged duping more than 10,000 
customers through their "Fine Art Treasures Gallery" show, which aired 
on DirecTV and Dish Network.

The couple also said they rigged auctions by creating false and inflated 
bids for art and jewelry sold during the live auctions, prosecutors said.

Nearly $4 million and various pieces of artwork were seized when the 
couple were arrested.
