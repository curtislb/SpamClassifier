SatCon Joins Green Grid Consortium




BOSTON, May 02, 2007 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- SatCon Technology Corporation(R)
(Nasdaq CM: SATC), a developer and supplier of power management and
system architecture solutions for the alternative energy and distributed
power markets today announced that it has recently joined The Green Grid
as a contributing member. The Green Grid is a consortium of information
technology companies and professionals seeking to lower the overall
consumption of power usage in data centers around the globe. 

"As technology industry leaders like SatCon continue to join our
organization, we can more effectively provide insight to data center
managers to help them reduce power consumption," said Roger Tipley, a
director of The Green Grid. "We're pleased that companies like SatCon
continue to join The Green Grid, as power management solution providers
are at the forefront of the effort to help the industry meet the need
for energy efficiency standards." 

"We are pleased to be a Contributor Member to The Green Grid," stated
Clemens van Zeyl, President of SatCon Power Systems. "Their focus on DC
power distribution is a good fit for us with our history of high-power
DC applications and their emphasis on energy efficiency is an excellent
complement to our renewable energy product portfolio." 

SatCon, through its wholly owned Canadian subsidiary, was the first
company in the world to supply high-power DC power electronics using
IGBT power transistor technology. DC power distribution based on power
transistor technology is recognized for its high efficiency and power
quality, and is also a key feature in SatCon's alternative energy
inverter products. To date, SatCon has supplied over 450 MW of
high-power DC power distribution equipment utilizing IGBT technology,
more than any other company in the world. 

SatCon's PowerGate(R) inverter brand is currently one of the leading
inverter products for large commercial fuel cell and photovoltaic
applications in North America. SatCon's rigorous focus on power
management and overall efficiency is a significant reason why the
PowerGate(R) is one of the most efficient inverter products available on
the market. 

"Our legacy of large, highly efficient power systems has finally come
around full circle," said Elbert L. McDaniel, Vice President of Sales &
Marketing for SatCon Power Systems. "SatCon is truly one of the leaders
in green power - and we are very pleased that we can be a part of The
Green Grid and participate in their mission by applying our technology
to one of the fastest growing energy sectors - the data center."
