I do not have a way to check this card in other OS's.  I can not guess
at this point whether or not the card might have some problem of its
own.  However, I do have another one just like it, so perhaps I can
find time in the next day or two to swap out the card to see if that
solves the problem (now reaching for and grasping at a bucket of
straws ;) ).

Thanks, and have a great day.
