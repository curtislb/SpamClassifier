Lou Dobbs Tonight
Tuesday June 19, 2007

Tonight, the United States military launches one of the biggest
offensives in Iraq since the fall of Saddam Hussein. We’ll have
a full report.

As the Senate resumes debate over the so-called comprehensive
immigration reform, some on Capitol Hill are asking tough
questions about the abuse of some categories of visas. Senators
Durbin and Grassley want answers as to whether the H-1B program
bypasses American workers in favor of cheaper high tech labor
from abroad. The Government Accountability Office found flaws
in how visas are administered, and congressional hearings
revealed serious humanitarian concerns with the H-2A and H-2B
programs. We’ll have full coverage.

The Commerce Department drew up new export rules for high tech
exports to China. The new regulations allow so-called trusted
customers in China to obtain U.S. technologies without export
licenses. Critics suggest that this could fall into the hands
of the Communist Chinese military. Surprisingly, Beijing
objects to the new rules, saying it’s inappropriate for the
U.S. to launch regulations without agreement from the Chinese
government. We’ll have a special report.

The U.S. Border Patrol says apprehensions of illegal aliens are
declining. But there’s new evidence that illegal aliens are
using diversion tactics to cross the border undetected. Illegal
aliens are taking extreme measures including setting fires near
observation towers to divert Border Patrol agents and mapping
out the agents’ shifts so they can cross while they’re changing
posts. Join us tonight for a full investigation.

Three of the nation's best radio talk show hosts: Mark Simone,
WABC in New York, Wilmer Leon, XM Radio in Washington, DC and
Peter Boyles, KHOW in Denver join Lou.

Visit http://cnn.com/loudobbstonight to read Lou’s
latest commentary on why President Bush ought to ease up on his
ill-considered push for the so-called comprehensive immigration
reform legislation.

Lou Dobbs lays out his manifesto to save the middle class in
his new book, “War on the Middle Class: How the Government, Big
Business, and Special Interest Groups Are Waging War on the
American Dream and How to Fight Back.” War on the Middle Class
is now on sale in bookstores near you and on Amazon.com and
BarnesandNoble.com.
