Each failure occurs with the PCCMETHODs.  Looking a little more, the  
optional parameters seem to be the ones causing trouble.  Somehow,  
interp->current_args points to bad data.  It looks to always be  
something like 0x7fffffxxxxxx, and it just crashes later on.  I'll look  
more into it later unless someone figures the fix.
