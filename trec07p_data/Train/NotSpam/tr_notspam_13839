There's a very easy fix for this:
renice 3 `ps -e |grep speechd-up |head -1 |cut -d' ' -f1`
sets the niceness level of speechd-up to 3, and the spelling issue
goes away.  No need to compile your kernel without preemption of the
big kernel lock, etc.
It works for me, at any rate.  YMMV.

PS. I think there are issues with speechd-up, but I can't quite put my
finger on them.  speechd-up seems to be overly greedy when reading and
speaking text from /dev/softsynth.
