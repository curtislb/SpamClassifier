I have played around with many single board computers. I sold several 
on ebay last year. I would recommend looking into one of the industrial 
boards like PC104, one manufacturer that has very good prices is 
Advantech 

http://www.advantech.com/

There are also very good deals on similar boards selling on ebay quite
regularly, for example I've seen some sell as low as $30, and I sold 
one that was a 1Ghz PC104 with 512MB ram, a dual PCMCIA add
on card, a PCMCIA wireless card, all cables and accessories, and I
sold it for $199, it was worth much more new but I needed to get 
rid of stuff that wasn't being used. It was a nice setup but too power
hungry for my projects.

I used to do a lot of work on PC compatible small boards usually in 
the 6x4 inch format, but now I'm working on ARM based boards,
with more specialized purposed, mainly due to their much lower power
consumption for battery operation.

Set up automated searches on ebay for keywords PC104, PC/104
and Single Board Computer and watch for a while, you'll see some 
really good deals.
