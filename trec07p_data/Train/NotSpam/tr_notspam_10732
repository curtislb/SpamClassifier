Hello,

I have been trying to build a package for R to use on windows.  I have
been able to build it with out problems except for one thing.  I am
creating a zip file to be installed by the R gui.

I have four directories under the main dir.  I have data, man, R, and
src.  The problem that I have been having, is that the data directory is
being zipped up, then when I  install the package the data directory
isn't being unzipped when using the gui (This is the main way many of
the users that I work with use R).  When I make my call to build the zip
fill it looks like the following:

>>R CMD build --binary  --use-zip-help --docs=normal batdebug

I have taken out the --use-zip-help flag and I still created the zipped
data directory.  I have three items in the data directory, a config file
and two java files that are invoked by a dll that is in the src
directory.  The three files in the data directory is about 1,200 KB in
total size.  

I have R 1.9.1 installed to build with because it doesn't zip up the
data directory like the current version of R.  I have looked into the R
documentation to find if I am not using a flag or something.  I have
tried the --auto-zip and --use-zip-data flags and neither of these flags
did anything different. 

I have been experiencing this problem with R 2.4.1 ( I have tried with
several other versions of R and they all do the same thing since 2.0.0.)

Can anyone point me in the correct direction of a flag to include or how
to fix this problem.

Thanks in advance,
Jason E Eglin
