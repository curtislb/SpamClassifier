7:46 PM, 6/18/07, Update: Shuttle crew bids farewell=20

The Atlantis astronauts bid farewell to the international space station's c=
rew late today, floating out of the Destiny laboratory module one by one be=
fore sealing hatches and gearing up for undocking Tuesday morning.

In a brief farewell ceremony, shuttle commander Rick Sturckow thanked Exped=
ition 15 commander Fyodor Yurchikhin, flight engineer Oleg Kotov and newly =
arrived engineer/science officer Clay Anderson for a successful, if difficu=
lt mission. Anderson's predecessor, Sunita Williams, looked on, winding up =
a record six-month stay in orbit.

"It's been a great mission but all good things come to an end," Sturckow sa=
id. "We've had a wonderful time up here with the Expedition 15 crew. We've =
swapped out crew members and brought Clay Anderson to your crew, Fyodor, an=
d we'll take Suni Williams home. I know you'll miss her. She's a joy to wor=
k with, but it's time for her to go back to planet Earth.

"We're very happy about the success of the installation of the S3/S4 (solar=
 array) truss, it's fully operational, and many other tasks were accomplish=
ed. We faced some adversity together but through the joint efforts of our c=
rews and working with our flight control centers in Houston and in Moscow, =
the problems were overcome and the mission was a success. Thank you very mu=
ch."

Yurchikhin then took the microphone and speaking in accented English, said =
"the time was very interesting, the time coming too slowly and going too fa=
st."

"Only 10 days ago we wait for launch of shuttle," Yurchikhin said. "Ten day=
s, too short time. But very precious time. And now we can say the shuttle c=
rew did very well, all tasks. And of course, we had some problems and thank=
 you very much, of course, to MCC-Houston and MCC-Moscow because everybody =
on ground worked very hard, all day, all night with us. Because we are one =
big crew, everybody, and now we would like to say goodbye shuttle, have a g=
ood, safe landing."

If all goes well, Atlantis will undock from the space station at 10:42 a.m.=
 Tuesday. Landing back at the Kennedy Space Center is targeted for 1:54 p.m=
. Thursday, although predicted clouds and thunderstorms could cause problem=
s. Atlantis has enough on-board supplies to stay in orbit and make landing =
attempts Friday and Saturday if bad weather or other problems prevent an on=
-time touchdown in Florida on Thursday.

Phil Engelauf, chief of the flight director's office, said late today the s=
tation's revived computer system appeared to be operating normally after a =
complex test earlier today to make sure it could safely orient the station =
as required after Atlantis departs.

"We're happy to report at the end of the game here we have everything worki=
ng as it's supposed to," he said. "All of the checkouts today seemed to hav=
e left the computers working well and we're in good shape as we're getting =
ready to undock tomorrow."

But engineers still don't know what caused power supply surge protectors to=
 fail last week, knocking the computers out of action. Some engineers suspe=
ct the failures were triggered by some sort of change in the station's powe=
r grid when a new set of solar arrays was installed by the Atlantis astrona=
uts. But so far, engineers have not found anything obvious.

In any case, the computers were revived Friday and Saturday after Yurchikhi=
n and Kotov bypassed the protective circuitry with jumper cables.

"We have the computers in a configuration that appears to be working nomina=
lly at this time," Engelauf said. "But admittedly, there has been a bypass,=
 or a modification, made that puts these computers not in their nominal con=
figuration. And so, the owners of that hardware, the Russian flight control=
 community, are still looking very closely at the performance of that syste=
m and are evaluating its robustness.

"While we believe the station is in a very good configuration right now and=
 appears to be operating nominally, we still haven't found what folks would=
 call a 'smoking gun' that can identify exactly what caused the initial pro=
blem."

An undocking timeline and an updated flight plan will be posted here later =
this evening.
