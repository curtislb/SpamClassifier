Install speechd-up, speech-dispatcher and flite.  If flite is the only synth, 
then you should be able to load the software speech module, start speechd-up and 
flight should talk.  To test flite before making it work with speakup, type 
flite followed by anything you want flite to say.  If you have multiple software 
synths installed, look at your speech-distapcher configuration files to ensure 
you're working with the correct synth.
