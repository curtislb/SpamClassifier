Are we ready for such a future? In '[1]Robo-quandary,' the Milwaukee

silicone plates; we can make the blind see; the deaf hear; we can read

[0]CmdrGravy writes "The [1]Church Of Scientology is currently engaged in
a row with the BBC, a result of an investigation by reporter John
Sweeney. Sweeney is investigating the Church Of Scientology, trying to
judge changes in the organization over the last few years; He's trying to
[2]discover if they've moved away from the questionable practices and
secrecy they have employed in the past. The conflict centers around a
YouTube video posted by the scientologists. It shows Mr. Sweeney losing
his temper with a scientology spokesman. Mr. Sweeney's outburst came at
the end of a tour of a scientology exhibition which attempts to portray
psychiatrists as evil nazi type torturers entitled 'Psychiatry: Industry
of Death' which is both gruesome and utterly unconvincing. The BBC
appears willing to stand behind its reporter, in spite of the pressure
brought to bear by the scientologist organization."

Last week, Sci-Fi writer Charlie Stross was invited to speak at a
technology open day at engineering consultancy TNG Technology Consulting
in Munich. He's posted a transcript of his discussion on his website,
which features a [0]fascinating analysis of where technology is going in
the next 10-25 years. Instead of envisioning outlandish future
developments, he looks at what the impact might be on society from very
reasonable iterations of today's SOTA. "10Tb is an interesting number.
That's a megabit for every second in a year -- there are roughly 10
million seconds per year. That's enough to store a live DivX video stream
-- compressed a lot relative to a DVD, but the same overall resolution --
of everything I look at for a year, including time I spend sleeping, or
in the bathroom. Realistically, with multiplexing, it puts three or four
video channels and a sound channel and other telemetry -- a heart
monitor, say, a running GPS/Galileo location signal, everything I type
and every mouse event I send -- onto that chip, while I'm awake ... Add
optical character recognition on the fly for any text you look at,
speech-to-text for anything you say, and it's all indexed and searchable.
'What was the title of the book I looked at and wanted to remember last
Thursday at 3pm?' Think of it as google for real life. "

An anonymous reader writes "The Wall Street Journal takes a look at the
[0]new online media strategy being rolled out by CBS. Just over a year
ago they rolled out their 'Innertube' service on the CBS website. The
streaming video offering allowed viewers to watch sports and reruns
directly on the web, but required potential consumers to view the video
on CBS.com. That didn't work, even a little bit. So, they've learned
their lesson: 'The company plans to pursue a drastically revised strategy
that involves syndicating its entertainment, news and sports video to as
much of the Web as possible. It represents a stark departure for the TV
industry. Most of CBS's major competitors, including Walt Disney Co.'s
ABC, General Electric Co.'s NBC Universal and News Corp.'s Fox, are to
some degree all betting that they can build their own Internet video
portals. Starting this week, an expanded menu of CBS's video content will
be available for free to consumers on as many as 10 different Web sites
ranging from Time Warner Inc.'s AOL to Joost Inc., a buzzy online video
service that is just rolling out. The company calls its new venture the
CBS Interactive Audience Network.' This new push is tied into a new
advertising strategy, which is covered in-depth in the article."

reduced mileage ratings for hybrids after the upcoming changes in gas
mileage calculations by the EPA. While the cars themselves aren't
changing, plugging these new numbers in to the equation makes a hybrid
much less cost effective: "The two top-selling hybrid vehicles, the Prius
and Honda's Civic Hybrid, will lose 12 and 11 miles per gallon
respectively from their city driving estimates." The new values come from
more realistic testing; the old, over-inflated ratings were higher in
part because the cars idled a lot, allowing the hybrids to completely
turn off their engines. The new ratings should be more in line with what
hybrid drivers are actually seeing."

Last week Gamehead's Geoff Keighley interviewed Shigeru Miyamoto, and the
well-known designer [0]tossed off a mildly controversial comment.
Keighley asked him if he felt as though he was losing touch with the
American audience as a result of the popularity of games like Halo.
GameDaily reports on Miyamoto's response: "I could make Halo. It's not
that I couldn't design that game. It's just that I choose not to. One
thing about my game design is that I never try to look for what people
want and then try to make that game design. I always try to create new
experiences that are fun to play." Bungie took exception to that, and
[1]Frank Connor retorted in his interview with Joystiq: "Yeah, well. I
just want to go on the record and say that Bungie is hard at work on a
side-scrolling platform game featuring some plumbers -- I'm not going to
say what their ethnicity is, it's none of anyone's business -- but we
took that as a gauntlet, a sort of glove slap, and we're going to respond
in 2D scrolling style. That's all I'm saying." [2]We discussed that
article, along with several other pieces of Halo 3 coverage, this past
Saturday.

to a press release provided in translation to me by an authoritative
source, Norway now joins Belgium, Finland, and France (among other
nations) in moving towards a final decision to require such use. The
Norwegian recommendation was revealed by Minister of Renewal Heidi Grande
Roys, on behalf of the Cabinet-appointed Norwegian Standards Council. If
adopted, it would require all government agencies and services to use
these two formats, and would permit other formats (such as OOXML) to be
used only in a redundant capacity.Reflecting a pragmatic approach to the
continuing consideration of OOXML by ISO/IEC JTC 1, the recommendation
calls for Norway to 'promote the convergence of the ODF and OOXML, in
order to avoid having two standards covering the same usage.' According
to the press release, the recommendation will be the subject of open
hearings, with opinions to be rendered to the Cabinet before August 20
this summer.The Cabinet would then make its own (and in this case
binding) recommendation to the Norwegian government."

The New York Times is running a look [0]behind the scenes with
singer/songwriter Jonathan Coulton, creator the somewhat popular "Thing a
week" songs on his blog. Coulton describes a bit of how he got started
and what daily life is like maintaining relations with his fans. "Along
the way, he discovered a fact that many small-scale recording artists are
coming to terms with these days: his fans do not want merely to buy his
music. They want to be his friend. And that means they want to interact
with him all day long online. They pore over his blog entries, commenting
with sympathy and support every time he recounts the difficulty of
writing a song. They send e-mail messages, dozens a day, ranging from
simple mash notes of the "you rock!" variety to starkly emotional
letters, including one by a man who described singing one of Coulton's
love songs to his 6-month-old infant during her heart surgery. Coulton
responds to every letter, though as the e-mail volume has grown to as
many as 100 messages a day, his replies have grown more and more terse,
to the point where he's now feeling guilty about being rude."

[0]PetManimal writes "Mike Elgan has [1]had it with useless lights on
gadgets and computers. He singles out the Palm Treo and the Dell XPS
gaming laptops as being particularly bad with the use of unnecessary
lights, and also cites the plethora of LEDs on desktop PCs and
peripherals. 'My PC and other computing equipment make my office look
like a jet cockpit. I have two LCD monitors, each of which has two
indicator lights that flash even when the PC is turned off. The attached
sound control has a light on it. My keyboard has multiple lights. The
power cord has lights, the printer has lights, and the power button is
illuminated. My cable modem and Linksys router flash like crazy all the
time. Together, these useless lights create a visual cacophony of
blinking, multicolored lights that make me feel like I'm taking part in a
NASA stress test for astronaut candidates.' Elgan calls on manufacturers
to respect his 'Gadget Bill of Lights' to restrict the use of nag lights
and allow users to turn them off. He also says the industry should pay
more attention to industrial design when creating new products."

publicly announced or until at least one customer complaint is made.
Before you start disagreeing with this policy, hear out the rest of his
argument. 'Our company spends significantly to root out security issues,'
says the reader. 'We train all our programmers in secure coding, and we
follow the basic tenets of secure programming design and management. When
bugs are reported, we fix them. Any significant security bug that is
likely to be high risk or widely used is also immediately fixed. But if
we internally find a low- or medium-risk security bug, we often sit on
the bug until it is reported publicly. We still research the bug and come
up with tentative solutions, but we don't patch the problem.'"

Engadget is reporting that NASA's recent moon-dirt digging competition

Technology Ranch was able to notch first place by relocating just over
143-pounds in 30 minutes, but fell quite short on picking up any award
monies. So for those of you who weren't exactly ready to go mano-a-mano
with these guys and gals this time around, next year you've all got
$750,000 on the line."

A recent observation by the ESA's Cluster Spacecraft was able to finally
[0]prove a 20-year-old theory. "On 24 January 2001, the four Cluster
spacecraft were flying at an approximate altitude of 105 000 kilometres,
in tetrahedron formation. Each spacecraft was separated from the others
by a distance of about 600 kilometres. With such a distance between them,
as they approached the bow shock, scientists expected that every
spacecraft would record a similar signature of the passage through this
region. Instead, the readings they got were highly contradictory. They
showed large fluctuations in the magnetic and electric field surrounding
each spacecraft. They also revealed marked variations in the number of
solar wind protons that were reflected by the shock and streaming back to
Sun."

stance with regard to the [1]status of the Free Software movement. With
claims like; "The Free Software movement is dead. Linux doesn't exist in
2007. Even Linus has got a job today" it would certainly seem that the
next offensive is going to be sponsored by denial. "For the desktop, Hilf
sees a new frontier in terms of rich client programming. With more and
more services by Amazon, Google, Yahoo and, of course, Microsoft being
run as services rather than as software installed locally, it will be up
to the desktop to provide richer functionality."

Taking a closer look at the seemingly calm center of a hurricane, NASA
researchers have been able to determine a few clues about [0]what powers
a hurricane. "Using computer simulations and observations of 1998's
Hurricane Bonnie in southern North Carolina, scientists were able to get
a detailed view of pockets of swirling, warm humid air moving from the
eye of the storm to the ring of strong thunderstorms in the eyewall that
contributed to the intensification of the hurricane. The findings suggest
that the flow of air parcels between the eye and eye wall — largely
believed trivial in the past — is a key element in hurricane intensity
and that there's more to consider than just the classic 'in-up-and-out'
flow pattern. The classic pattern says as air parcels flow 'in' to the
hurricane's circulation, they rise 'up,' form precipitating clouds and
transport warm air to the upper atmosphere before moving 'out' into
surrounding environmental air."
