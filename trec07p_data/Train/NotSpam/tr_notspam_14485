ugh. pedantic semantics...

yes, the real code is beyond what I would think of as "beginner"
I truly meant to just post a small, working piece pf code that worked
with
some basic data structures... The DBI client is a bit more
complicated, yes?

The sample I put out and the code I was
working on are not identical. I declared my array in a different scope
in
the sample. Neither is "wrong", they are different.

ugh. insults. I am not trying to insulting you Paul, why resort to
that?
You have no idea how many programs I've written, well. I'd say its bad
form
to assume the worst or lowest in people.

please examine logic - rewriting core Perl docs vs a 10 line sample
program

no, I'd suggest you read it that way.. Its notoriously difficult to
convey context
and nuance in a few lines of ascii text. Please refer to your RTFM and
then
essentially yelling at me for a modest sample program.

I am not backing down from your brow-beating. I posted a small
working
sample program then found out more about the context I was dealing
with
and attempted to discuss it in an unassuming manner. For this I get
these
responses. phooey!

I'll be posting again from time to time, and probably going to OSCon.
Happy
to talk with you anytime. May not respond every time though. I think I
am
sensing a pattern here...

best regards
  -Brian
