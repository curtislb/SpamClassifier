Okay.I know that Ubuntu contains a graphical installer, with Orca. Question 
is, does it contain Speakup at all?
I wish to see if I could install Ubuntu without using a GUI environment. How 
would I get Speakup to talk, eaven if it's installed in the latest Ubuntu 
kernels? Any help is really helpful on this issue. ;) Regards, --Keith, 
KeithNet Network Administrator.
