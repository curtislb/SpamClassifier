Hello All:

Please forgive this question if it is already one of those dead horses.

I didn't find a specific answer in the archive.

I wish to add speakup to a 2.6.20 machine.  And, I have a dectalk express.  I
tried it a few weeks ago with out success.  I then read there was a problem
with the dectalk express driver.

Any info pertaining to this would be greatly appreciated.

Many thanks!
Terry
