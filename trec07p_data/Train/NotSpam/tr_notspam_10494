The best doc out there is the book Mastering Perl/Tk.
The book is on cd, and may be available online at places
like http://safari.oreilly.com/1565927168

Otherwise, there is just a hodge-podge assortment of 
mini-tutorials. Just google for them.

http://groups.google.com is a great place to get sample Perl/Tk
scripts. Almost every type of script has been posted online, and all
you need to do is search for it.... like "perl tk button" etc.

But if you would tell us a bit about your script, we could give you a
head start by telling what widgets or modules you might need to use.
