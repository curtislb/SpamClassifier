TONIGHT ON SHOWBIZ TONIGHT- CNN HEADLINE PRIME 11pm ET/ 11pm PT

<b>LINDSAY LOHAN'S WILD WEEKEND!</b>
>From her DUI arrest after a car crash to her collapse outside a club, has Lindsay finally hit rock bottom? Who's to blame for her out of control behavior? The startling story and pictures on TV's most provocative entertainment news show.

<b>LINDSAY'S FATHER SPEAKS OUT!</b>
Lindsay and her dad haven't spoken in years, but now he's reaching out, saying he wants to help her. Michael Lohan is a recovering alcoholic and has spent some time behind bars -- what does he have to offer her at this point? Michael Lohan in his own words, tonight on Showbiz Tonight.

<b>NO MORE ROSIE ON "THE VIEW"</b>
It's the first post-Rosie O'Donnell day on "The View" -- what Elisabeth said about their now infamous feud -- and Barbara Walters weighs in as well! So what happens next? Can the show survive without Rosie? Showbiz Tonight has all the angles covered.

<b>SHOWBIZ TONIGHT QUESTION OF THE DAY:</b>
Lindsay Lohan's wild weekend: Do you feel sorry for her?
