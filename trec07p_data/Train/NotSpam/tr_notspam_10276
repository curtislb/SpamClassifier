Cabot Wealth Advisory - Thinking Big Vs. Thinking Small
May 14, 2007

The Vastness of the Vineyards

Looking for Huge Mass Markets

Put on Your Optimist's Hat


I'm writing this Wealth Advisory just one week removed from a truly
fantastic trip to California's wine country.  As a lover of lakefront
property, the best way I can describe it is this:  wine country (my fiancé
and I mainly stayed and toured in Sonoma, though one day we did explore
route 29 in Napa) has all the beauty and calming effect of any big lake
... except instead of a big body of water, you've got vineyards.  

If you've never been to this part of the U.S., you should definitely do
so, whether you know the difference between a Chardonnay (most popular
wine in the U.S.) and a Malbec (a former mixing grape that some wineries
are now using as drink in and of itself) or not.  

Hell, I'm anything but a wine connoisseur (I'm a bourbon man myself), and
this was one of my top vacations ever.  Just seeing and driving through
the huge hills with gorgeous green grass, acres of vineyards, and cute
country architecture will put a full seven-day smile on your face.  It's
nature at its best out there.

What was the most striking part of the trip?  One was the gas prices
($3.75 a gallon for the cheapest brand ... I kid you not!).  But the other
was the vastness of the vineyards ... they went on for miles and miles and
miles, in every direction, up and down hills and in regular folks'
backyards.  And when you're tasting at one of the larger wineries, you
(like us) might hear something like, "This wine you're tasting is one of
our limited releases; we made only 17,000 cases of it last year."  

"Only" 17,000 cases!  That's 204,000 bottles, and that's just one
limited-release vintage, from one winery among dozens in California. 
That's one heckuva lot of wine.  And it got me thinking about size and
scale, and how the ordinary person (like me in wine country) can't imagine
how big things are in the great wide world.

==

You see, we're all brought up in a certain environment, a certain world
that we're exposed to.  In my case, I was exposed to a couple hundred kids
my age, of generally middle- to upper-middle class life.  And I was taught
all the same worldly statistics as the rest of you - that there's six
billion people in the world, or that the U.S. produces more than $12
trillion worth of goods and services per year, etc.  But most people
(including me) can never really grasp the size of those types of figures. 
Our brains aren't programmed that way.

Which is one reason I believe the average investor has so much trouble in
the market.  When he or she encounters a new, revolutionary product that's
targeting a huge mass market, it's difficult to imagine just how big that
company could become.  Instead, we tend to artificially put limits on a
company's growth potential, believing that rapid growth may continue for a
little while ... but eventually, it'll be back to "normal."  

(Incidentally, a lot of people do the same thing with their own careers,
believing "it'll never get better than this."  And because they think that
way, it never does.  But I digress.)

Put another way, most investors tend to think small, instead of thinking
big.  And if you don't believe you'll ever make, say, 100% on a stock, you
never will. 

The obvious example of late has been the solar stocks, which we've written
about numerous times in the Wealth Advisory.  Currently, our favorite of
the bunch, First Solar (FSLR), sports a forward P/E ratio of nearly 140,
and sports a market capitalization of nearly $5 billion.  Expensive!  

But is it?  The company is growing at stunning rates (its first quarter
revenues nearly quintupled from the year before), and there are only so
many solar stocks to invest in.  Who knows how large the firm will become,
or how many states and countries will encourage solar power use?  And what
happens if solar becomes nearly cost-competitive with current electricity?
 How big could that market be?  This is what I mean by thinking big.

Another example is Crocs (CROX), one of our favorite stocks at the present
time.  (It's been in the Cabot Market Letter's Model Portfolio since early
last October.)  Sentiment surrounding this maker of "plastic shoes"
remains skeptical, with millions of shares sold short and most investors
awaiting the end of this so-called fad.  But I'm thinking this is no fad! 

Hey, I'm not saying Crocs will someday replace formal shoes.  But Crocs
does represent a new type of footwear, and there's no reason to think that
tens of millions of pairs won't be sold in the U.S. ... and hundreds of
millions overseas.  It's difficult to think in these huge figures, but
when you're dealing with a mass market, growth can astound.

In the latest two quarters, for instance, sales and earnings both rose
more than 200% from the year before, while margins swelled.  And analysts
- who are typically a conservative lot - are now looking for $3 a share in
earnings for 2007.  Just eight months ago, they were looking for half
that!

The only way you're going to capitalize on the market's biggest winners is
by first believing a stock is capable of rising 50%, 100% or more over a
period of months.  In other words, you need to think big!

Back to the present market, I don't believe enough investors are truly
thinking big about the potential of this bull market.  Simply put, this
market is going to head higher ... much higher.

I say this because we've seen a slew of unique market timing signals that
only come around at the beginning of major bull moves.  Tim already
mentioned one in the Wealth Advisory six weeks ago:  the occurrence of two
9-to-1 volume up days (what we call the Volume Blast-Off Indicator) within
a one-month span.  Historically, when this occurs, the S&P 500 is up 6%
three months later, 12% six months later, and 18% a year later.

What else?  What about historically high short interest on the NYSE?  As
of the middle of April (short interest is reported once a month), shorts
have been super-active; when short interest has been this elevated in
years past, the S&P 500 is up more than 5% three months later, 10% six
months later and 18% a year later.  (Those figures sound familiar?)

And here's something that doesn't exactly produce buy signals, but is
interesting nonetheless.  We recently read that, if you take all of the
buy/hold/sell ratings from analysts on all the S&P 500 companies, just 47%
of those ratings are a "buy" of one sort or the other.  That's a ten-year
low (!!), telling you analysts are overly pessimistic.  Incidentally, back
in 2000, that figure was a huge 70%, a sign of euphoria.

Want more?  How about the fact that, since 1950 the Dow, on average, rises
50% from the low of the mid-term year of the President Cycle (i.e., 2006,
2002, 1998, etc.) to its high of the following year.  No joke!  Since the
Dow's 2006 low was 10,700, I believe Dow 15,000 or even 16,000 is possible
this year.

Of course, there will be corrections along the way ... some scary drops to
shake out the weak hands.  But overall, you should be thinking about how
you're going to make truly big money this year.  

One vehicle I wrote about before is still a good one:  ProShares, which
give you the opportunity to own a fund that moves twice the Dow (which,
believe it or not, is the strongest index in the market since the February
low), or the S&P 500, or the Russell 2000, and so on.  If the market's
going to make a big move, these ProShares will give you a relatively
low-risk (compared to a volatile growth stock) way to capture that move.  

But whatever your investment of choice, let me leave you with this
message:  Be an optimist, be a bull.  The odds heavily favor some great
upward movement in the market this year, so think big and give yourself a
chance to make big money.

All the best,

Mike Cintolo
