Try comparing packet traces of 3.0.21c and 3.0.24.

yes, unfortunately this is not always predictive of actual windows  
performance.

I believe that samba4 has a backend that is capable of creating  
workload files, though I've never experimented with it.

IIRC the default for "msdfs root" changed to "yes" around this time.  
We found that enabling this causes windows clients to do a lot more  
requests, with a corresponding drop in (netbench) performance.
