Your data is "compositional data". The R package "compositions" might be
useful. You might also want to consult the book by J. Aitchison: statistical
analysis of compositional data.

Subject: Re: [R] Comparing multiple distributions

Nobody answered my first request. I am sorry if I did not explain my  
problem clearly. English is not my native language and statistical  
english is even more difficult. I'll try to summarize my issue in  
more appropriate statistical terms:

Each of my observations is not a single number but a vector of 5  
proportions (which add up to 1 for each observation). I want to  
compare the "shape" of those vectors between two treatments (i.e. how  
the quantities are distributed between the 5 values in treatment A  
with respect to treatment B).

I was pointed to Hotelling T-squared. Does it seem appropriate? Are  
there other possibilities (I read many discussions about hotelling  
vs. manova but I could not see how any of those related to my  
particular case)?

Thank you very much in advance for your insights. See below for my  
earlier, more detailed, e-mail.
