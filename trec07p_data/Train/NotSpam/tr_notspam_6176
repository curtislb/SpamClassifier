This is a bizarre criticism. Youtube and other sites that wrap "free
[meaning zero-cost] user-produced content" into their own proprietary
wrap and then profiteer off the result are perhaps worthy of such
criticism (or perhaps not -- people evidently were satisfied with the
offering or they wouldn't have contributed).  Personally, I *was*
bothered  by that co-option of free content.

But clearly the *right* thing to do is to deliver that content with
free-licenses, which of course, removes the proprietary wrap and makes
the content truly free to use. These then become true community sharing
sites. The fact that a "multinational corporation" is doing it doesn't
change that (that's the beauty of free licenses). It may, of course, be
argued that they have "ulterior" motives for their behavior -- but
basically that's always true: corporations are machines for making
profit after all.

So what's your beef? You're just jealous of rich people? I mean I can
sort of understand that, but the "community" did not beat these people
to the punch with a sharing site, so they did it, and now they reap a
reward for that. I'm just not seeing the glaring injustice here. Now the
community has a place to go to share this kind of content, and the
didn't even have to spend resources on developing it. The cost? Some
advertising. SO WHAT?

So give the Devil his due, and get over it. If you really think it's a
problem, start a better, more "community-based" site. Oh and make sure
you don't offset your costs with advertising -- you wouldn't want to be
a hypocrite! ;-)

Cheers,
Terry
