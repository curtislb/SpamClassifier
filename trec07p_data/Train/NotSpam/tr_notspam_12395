[0]slashthedot writes "Microsoft [1]caught some Indian retailers selling
pirated copies of Windows by sending in a dummy customer to ask for a
copy of Windows to be installed on their PC. The dealers claim that they
are promoting MS software in this way. One retailer said: 'Since we are
are not charging anything extra for installing the software, it means
that we are actually not trading in pirated software. For us this is just
a sewa (selfless act) that we are offering to our customers. Besides, the
pricing of their operating systems is way too high for the Indian
markets.'"

Ilgaz notes that The Register has [0]posted benchmark results from Oracle
11i running on four 4.7GHz Power6 chips. Quoting: "The speedy chips
confirm IBM's boasting that Power6 would arrive near 5GHz. They also show
that IBM's customers have a lot to look forward to in terms of raw
performance." Rumor has it that the Power6 chips will be announced on
Tuesday.

[0]SlinkySausage writes "Google is offering ISPs the opportunity to
[1]turn over their entire email operation to Google, with all customer
email hosted as Gmail accounts. This would allow Google to grow its user
base rapidly (Google is a distant third with 51M users compared to
Yahoo's 250M and Hotmail's 228M). There are some obvious benefits to end
users — Google is offering ISPs mailboxes of up to 10GB per user.
APCMag.com has posted an interesting piece looking at [2]the dark side of
Google's offer. Not least is in its reinforcing of the attachment people
have to their ISP's email address, making it harder to change ISPs if a
better deal comes along."

"[1]How does Gates shape up as a seer?" None strike me as particularly

time." and "Two years from now, spam will be solved." But in fairness to
Gates, for many years Microsoft's tagline was "a PC on every desktop and

2005, the foundation created a subsidiary, the for-profit [2]Mozilla

the Google contract...By creating a corporation to run the Firefox
project, Mozilla was committing to be less transparent. In part, that is
because Google insists on the secrecy of "its arrangement and
agreements," said board member Mitch Kapor.' The NYT article compares
this approach to Wikipedia's ongoing fundraisers and raises the issue of
transparency in open source projects. i.e. should Firefox's 1,000 to
2,000 developers and 80,000 evangelists have full knowledge of how
revenue is spent as well as the extent to which Google is able to
influence strategy vs. other stakeholders."

meeting the other day with senior executives from Cisco, Agilent

[1]enterprise users really want open source. "Naturally, I disagreed --
partially because I am a naturally disagreeable person. Any idiot can
make friends -- but can you make some really serious enemies? I
disagreed, however, because allegiance to open source depends on who you
are. Let me give you an example. If you are No. 1 or No. 2 in your
industry, you hate open source. You make your money by selling
proprietary solutions: Microsoft and Cisco. If you are No. 3 to No. 10,
you look at open source as a way to get back to those serious RSEUs,
because they are where you make money."

laptops to kids in developing countries, said Intel had hurt his mission
"enormously". Speaking to US broadcaster CBS, Intel's chairman denied the
claims. "We're not trying to drive him out of business," said Craig
Barrett. "We're trying to bring capability to young people." Mr Barrett
has previously dismissed the $100 laptop as a "gadget".'"

| Microsoft Announces OOXML-UOF Project with China                   |

[0]Andy Updegrove writes "Today, Microsoft announced its own
[1]interoperability project to bridge the gap between China's
domestically developed Uniform Office Format (UOF) and Microsoft's OOXML.
In the continuing tit for tat battle between ODF and OOXML, this
announcement tracks the intent of an already-existing 'harmonization'
committee, hosted by OASIS, that is exploring interoperability options
between ODF and UOF. Like the OOXML-ODF translator project announced by
Microsoft last year, the new effort will be an open source project hosted
by SourceForge. The announcement is, in one sense, no surprise. Microsoft
has been waging a nation-by-nation battle for the hearts and minds of
ISO/IEC JTC1 National Bodies, in an effort to win adoption of OOXML (now
Ecma 376) as a global standard with equal status to ODF (now ISO 26300).
In order to do so, it needs to offset the argument that one document
format standard is not only enough, but preferable. With UOF representing
a third entrant in the format race, easy translation of documents would
obviously be key to lessen the burden on customers of products based upon
one format or the other."

[0]mikesd81 writes "The Seattle Times is reporting that MySpace will be
providing a number of state attorney generals with [1]data on registered
sex offenders who use their site. Attorney generals from eight states
demanded last week that the company provide data on how many registered
sex offenders are using the site and where they live. MySpace obtained
the data from Sentinel Tech Holding Corp., which the company partnered
with in December to build a database with information on sex offenders.
Attorneys general in North Carolina, Connecticut, Georgia, Idaho,
Mississippi, New Hampshire, Ohio and Pennsylvania asked for the Sentinel
data last week."

[0]Riding with Robots writes "When the robotic geologist Spirit found the
latest [1]evidence for a wet Mars, 'You could hear people gasp in
astonishment,' said Steve Squyres, the lead scientist for the Mars
rovers. 'This is a remarkable discovery. And the fact that we found
something this new and different after nearly 1,200 days on Mars makes it
even more remarkable. It makes you wonder what else is still out there.'
The latest discovery, announced today, adds compelling new evidence for
ancient conditions that might have been favorable for life, according to
the rover team."

down the gauntlet at Microsoft's feet. Christian Einfeldt of Digital
Tipping Point says '[0]Sue Me First,' and he's not alone. More and more
people are [1]signing up and challenging Microsoft to put their lawyers
where their mouth is. The open source community is far from running
scared. Will Microsoft step up to the plate, or are they just continuing
a scare campaign with no real ability to leverage the patents they claim
open source is infringing?"
