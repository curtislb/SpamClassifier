This is a local api for local people, there's nothing for
you here ! :-).

Seriously it's designed for smbd internal use, knowing it's
accessing a local filesystem.... So I think it's just expecting
a "standard" unix permset to be mapped into an NT ACL. 

It doesn't matter if the path doesn't support POSIX ACLs
as it'll translate mode_t into an NT ACL.

Hmmmm. Is it causing you grief at the moment ?
