						<div class=3D"GreyHeading">CLARE BALDING ON THE GRAND NATIONAL</div>
						<div>It's one of the most open Grand Nationals in years and you could=
 make a case for almost half the field having a chance of glory.
<br>

<br>
As always there are some wonderful stories behind the runners and riders.
<br>

<br>
One of the most well-backed horses is Simon, owned by 87-year-old Mercy Rim=
ell.
<br>

<br>
The great-grandmother's late husband Fred trained four National winners bet=
ween 1956-1976 and his father Tom also won in the 1930s, so it would be won=
derful if jockey Andrew Thornton could make it win number six for the Rimel=
l family.
<br>

<br>
One horse that has slipped under the radar a little is L'Ami, who could fin=
ally give jockey AP McCoy his first National success.
<br>

<br>
Out of the field, I think he is the horse with the most potential.=20
<br>

<br>
He is only eight years old and could easily go on and win a Cheltenham Gold=
 Cup, which you can't say about many of the others.
<br>

<br>
Last year's winner Numbersixvalverde is in with a very good shout.=20
<br>

<br>
Throughout history winners of the big race have always had a strong record =
when they return to Aintree and he should challenge for a place.=20
<br>

<br>
My tip though is the mare Liberthine.
<br>

<br>
The rumours were that she was in foal (pregnant) and her hormones would be =
raging in a positive way, but late on Thursday it was revealed that she act=
ually isn't.=20
<br>

<br>
Despite this I still fancy her as jockey Sam Waley-Cohen has a great record=
 over the National fences, even though he has never ridden in the big race =
itself before, and his mount has proved she likes jumping them.=20
<br>

<br>
My advice to all of you wanting to put a bet on, is to go for a yard that i=
s in good form and a horse that enjoys quicker ground as it's going to be a=
 scorcher here at Aintree on Saturday.
<br>

<br>
Enjoy the race,
<br>

<br>
Clare
<br>

<br>
<b>Clare Balding will present BBC ONE's Grand National coverage from 1310 B=
ST on Saturday. The big race is at 1615 BST.</b></div></td>
