9:52 AM, 6/12/07, Update: Crew awake; solar array deploy on tap=20

The Atlantis astronauts were awakened at 9:08 a.m. by a recording of Louis =
Armstrong's "What a Wonderful World" beamed up from mission control. The cr=
ew plans to monitor the deployment of a new set of solar arrays they attach=
ed to the international space station Monday before enjoying a few hours of=
 off-duty time later today.

The primary goal of near-term space station assembly is building out the st=
atoin's main solar power truss to provide the electricity needed to support=
 European and Japanese research modules. When completed, the truss will str=
etch more than 300 feet from tip to tip. Two huge solar arrays on each end =
of the truss will track the sun as the station circles the globe, rotating =
and changing pitch as required to maximize electrical generation.

The P3/P4 solar array truss segment was attached to the left side of the po=
wer truss last September. The other set of left-side arrays - P6 - was inst=
alled on top of the station in 2000 to provide power during the early stage=
s of assembly. One of P6's two wings - P6-4B - was retracted during a shutt=
le mission last December. The other wing - P6-2B - will be retracted this w=
eek so the entire segment can be moved later this year to the left end of t=
he main truss.

The Atlantis astronauts installed the first right-side set of arrays - S3/S=
4 - on Monday and will oversee the deployment of its two wings today.

Getting a head start, flight controllers sent commands overnight to open th=
e solar array blanket boxes and to extend each solar array wing one mast ba=
y. They will be fully extended later today, one at a time in a stepwise fas=
hion, first to 49 percent and then to 100 percent with a half-hour gap in t=
he middle of the sequence to permit the sun to warm up the blankets. The id=
ea is to avoid a problem seen during the first array extensions in 2000 whe=
n blanket slats stuck together and caused problems.

"What happens is these panels tend to stick together and then as the mast i=
s being deployed, the panels would release and they would do that fairly dy=
namically and you can see how there's a wave that propagates up and down th=
e array and those panels towards the base moved quickly into the blanket bo=
x and that did cause some problems with the tensioning mechanism," station =
Flight Director Kelly Beck said of the first P6-2B extension in 2000. "The =
crew had to go outside during a spacewalk and correct it.

"So the new technique is designed to avoid that dynamic motion. Basically w=
hat we do is we deploy the array about halfway out, we let it sit with sun =
shining on the panels so those panels can warm up and as they warm up, they=
 tend to release. And so we'll sit there for 30 minutes and let the panels =
release. We'll deploy the 1A array first to the halfway point, wait 30 minu=
tes with sun on it and then complete the deploy of that array. It will be r=
epositioned and we'll do a small attitude maneuver to get sun directly on t=
he 3A array. It will be deployed halfway, same sequence, wait for 30 minute=
s to warm the panels and then complete the deploy."

The S4-1A mast will be extended to 49 percent starting at 11:43 a.m. and to=
 100 percent beginning at 12:23 p.m. The S4-3A mast will be extended half w=
ay starting at 1:13 p.m. Final extension to 100 percent is planned for 1:53=
 p.m.

"Every person on the crew will have a role because there are a number of th=
ings that we=92ll be watching for," Reilly said in a NASA interview. "As th=
e solar arrays unfurl, after we initiate the drive command and as these are=
 unfurling, they basically just, as if you had folded up a piece of paper b=
ack and forth, we just basically unfurl the whole solar array in that way. =
But as it=92s unfurling there=92s a, occasionally the panels that will tend=
 to stick a little bit because they=92ve been boxed up now for quite some t=
ime; but as they unfurl they=92ll start to unstick and jostle themselves a =
little bit, which is normal.

"But what we=92ll be watching for are those that might stick a little bit h=
arder than what we expect, and so we have what are called the tension reels=
, so we=92ll have two of our people on the crew that are going to be watchi=
ng the tension reels the whole time during the deploy. There=92ll be two of=
 the other folks that will be then counting the individual bays, because we=
 deploy out about halfway, to about 49 percent of the deploy, and then we s=
top and let sun basically heat up the components so that we don=92t hit a h=
igh-tension condition.

"The problem there is if we hit a high-tension condition then these tension=
 reels could lose their tension on the wires that actually hold everything =
in position. If that=92s the case, then we would have to go out and do an E=
VA so we=92re going to be watching that very carefully. The ground will the=
n leave this at 50 percent for one day-cycle, and then we come back once we=
 hit another day pass, then we will then deploy the solar arrays out the re=
st of the way to the 100 percent.

"Things we'll be watching for are the tension reels, as I mentioned, but we=
=92ll also be watching a tension bar that=92s at the base of the solar pane=
l itself, and we=92ll be watching to make sure that is basically not moving=
 until we get to the very last panels, and when we start pulling them out t=
o final tension, then that bar at the base will actually separate about 22 =
inches. Those are the things that we=92ll be watching for. But, for the mos=
t part, it=92s really just making sure everything just deploys nominally an=
d just in a nice, orderly sequence, nothing sticking, and nothing=92s reall=
y trying to jerk too much tension on the mechanisms and the base of the sol=
ar array blanket box."

During the P3/P4 attachment last September, the port-side solar alpha rotar=
y joint was configured for operation before the extension of the two SAWs. =
That was because the P4 arrays had to be rotated before their cooling radia=
tor could be deployed. That is not necessary for the S3/S4 segments, so the=
 crew is reversing that sequence, deploying the new SAWs and radiator first=
 before completing SARJ activation during their second spacewalk on flight =
day six.
