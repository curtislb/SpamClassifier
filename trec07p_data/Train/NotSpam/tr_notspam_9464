For the Frets on Fire arcade game which we are packaging I have found an
original artist willing to licence his works under the MIT licence. Four
of the five songs are completely original works; the fifth, however,
whilst being an original composition is inspired by another song. The
email I have from the artist is below; I think that probably this counts
as a derivative work, and hence would need permission from the original
author, but I am not sure.

Obviously debian-legal are not lawyers, but I would appreciate your
opinions. I could just leave it out to be on the safe side, I could
leave it in, hope that the ftp-masters accept it and hope that nothing
comes of it or I could try and get an opinion from someone like SPI.

What do you think is the best way to proceed?

Thanks,=20
Matt
