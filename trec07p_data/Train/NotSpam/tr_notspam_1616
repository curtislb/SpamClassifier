Hi, Now that the dectalk express driver is fixed would it be possible to 
update the rpms for fedora core 6 to 2.6.20 with this new driver?  I am 
currently running 2.6.19 as downloaded from speakupmodified.org and it works 
fine but like to keep my system as updated as possible.  Do you usually make 
announcements when a new rpm of the fedora kernels are released and if not 
what is the easiest way to check?  What is this read all mode?
