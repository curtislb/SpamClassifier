8:33 PM, 6/10/07, Update: Shannon says spacewalkers may be asked to tap dow=
n protruding insulation blanket=20

Concern about possible re-entry heat damage to the underlying structure of =
the shuttle Atlantis' left-side maneuvering rocket pod under a pulled-up in=
sulation blanket may prompt a simple spacewalk repair job, the chairman of =
NASA's Mission Management Team said today.

The front edge of the blanket in question apparently pulled away from adjac=
ent heat-shield tiles by the swift flow of air passing over it during the e=
arly stages of launch Friday.

John Shannon told reporters that engineers studying the protruding triangul=
ar 4-inch by 6-inch blanket are concerned about the possible effects of re-=
entry heating on the graphite epoxy honeycomb structure of the shuttle's le=
ft Orbital Maneuvering System pod.

Shuttles have safely returned to Earth on several occasions with broken or =
lost tiles and lost blankets on the OMS pods. But in some cases, the underl=
ying structure was damaged and required repairs.

"We have actually damaged that on several of those flights where you had so=
me heat effects," Shannon said. "When we talked to the engineering guys and=
 the structural team, they were a little bit uncomfortable today. And the r=
eason they were uncomfortable was because if you get down to that honeycomb=
, that structural area, you're losing some margin, you're not exactly in th=
e flight parameters you expect to go fly."

He said it was difficult to accurately predict what sort of damage might oc=
cur because engineers cannot tell how much underlying insulation might have=
 pulled away with the blanket.

"Because we do not want to damage flight hardware, we sent off a (team of e=
ngineers) to work with the EVA, the spacewalk team, to go assess some optio=
ns. The simplest is we would just tuck that blanket back down and fill that=
 cavity back up. And they're talking about different ways to maybe secure i=
t.

"We did not judge what the right answer was, we're going to let that spacew=
alk team go off and assess that and they'll come back to me tomorrow and la=
y out options, pros and cons, and then we'll decide A) if we want to do any=
thing with this blanket and then if we do want to do something, what is the=
 right course of action."

During the region of peak heating, the upper surfaces of the OMS pods exper=
ience 700 to 1,000 degree Fahrenheit for about 15 minutes. During that peri=
od, the shuttle is at such high altitudes that very little aerodynamic pres=
sure is present.

"You have the heating of the vehicle in this area that goes up and is signi=
ficant for 15- to 20-minute period of time but you really don't have any ae=
rodynamic loads on it at that time, it's very, very low dynamic pressure on=
 that blanket area," Shannon said. "So after you get through the high heati=
ng area, then you start to pick up aerodynamic loads.

"What does that mean to you? Well, what it means is whatever condition you =
start re-entry in with that cavity, or that blanket, it's going to pretty m=
uch stay in that configuration throughout the high-heating time frame. Then=
 it might change, it might pull up more, whatever, in a time when you don't=
 really care very much."

Shannon said he was not leaning one way or the other toward ordering a repa=
ir, saying "tomorrow I'll have a better idea of what the different options =
are."

But a few minutes later he said, "I think after seeing the effect on the gr=
aphite epoxy honeycomb on some (past flights) I'm leaning may be a little b=
it toward doing it, but we have to hear what the options are."

Because engineers don't know exactly what sort of heat damage to expect, "I=
 would just like to kind of avoid that whole scenario altogether and  tuck =
that blanket back down. And I'm expecting the team to come in and give me s=
ome ideas of how to do that and then we'll see where it fits in the timelin=
e. If we can accommodate it, I think that's probably what we'll do."

The Atlantis astronauts plan spacewalks Monday, Wednesday and Friday to act=
ivate and configure a new solar array and to carry out a variety of other t=
asks. If a repair job is added, it likely would occur during the third spac=
ewalk, after the high-priority work to complete the activation of the new s=
olar arrays.

3:50 PM, 6/10/07, Update: Atlantis docks with space station (UPDATED at 5:3=
0 p.m. with hatch opening; UPDATED at 8 p.m. with comments from flight dire=
ctor, MMT chairman)

Commander Rick Sturckow guided the shuttle Atlantis to a picture-perfect do=
cking with the international space station today after a dramatic end-over-=
end flip across the heart of South America to let the station crew photogra=
ph the shuttle's fragile heat shield. After a brief welcome-aboard ceremony=
 and a safety briefing by station commander Fyodor Yurchikhin,

Using a joystick on the shuttle's aft flight deck, Sturckow deftly closed o=
ut a trouble-free two-day rendezvous with a gentle docking at 3:36 p.m. as =
the two spacecraft sailed high above the east coast of Australia northeast =
of Sydney.

"ISS and Houston, from Atlantis. Capture confirmed," a shuttle astronaut ra=
dioed as the docking systems engaged. A few minutes later, hooks and latche=
s were activated to firmly pull the two spacecraft together. After leak che=
cks to make sure the interface is airtight, hatches were opened and the sta=
tion crew will welcome their shuttle colleagues aboard a few minutes past 5=
 p.m.

"Atlantis. Arriving," station flier Sunita Williams said, following naval t=
radition and ringing the ship's bell in the Destiny laboratory module. The =
shuttle crew then floated into the station to hugs, smiles and handshakes.

Running three months late because of hail damage to the shuttle's external =
fuel tank, Atlantis brought two welcome additions to the international lab =
complex: A $367 million set of solar panels and a fresh crew member - Clay =
Anderson - to replace Williams.

Launched to the outpost last December aboard shuttle Discovery, Williams wi=
ll set a new space endurance record for female astronauts and cosmonauts wh=
en she lands aboard Atlantis June 19 after 192 days off planet.

"Great job today, Atlantis, on the rendezvous," astronaut Terry Virts radio=
ed from mission control. "Very nice approach. And welcome to your new home,=
 Clay."

"Thanks a lot, Houston," Sturckow replied.

Lead flight director Cathy Koerner was elated.

"What a great day to be in the space business," she told reporters later. "=
We had just a picture-perfect rendezvous and docking today and I could not =
have asked for smoother operations between the flight control team and the =
crew on orbit. We made this look easy. To put that in perspective for you, =
on how not easy it really is, we took a quarter-million-pound vehicle today=
 and we connected it with about a half-million-pound (space station) and we=
 did all that at 17,500 mph."

Today's rendezvous and docking included a now-routine but nonetheless spect=
acular rotational pitch maneuver, or RPM, a key element in NASA's post-Colu=
mbia focus on assessing the health of the orbiter's heat shield before a cr=
ew commits to re-entry.

Spectacular video beamed down from the space station showed Atlantis perfor=
ming a graceful pirouette 600 feet directly below the laboratory, a slow-mo=
tion back flip against the backdrop of the Brazilian rain forest racing pas=
t 220 miles below.

There were no obvious signs of anything unusual, but engineers are just beg=
inning their assessment of zoomed-in digital photographs shot by station co=
mmander Fyodor Yurchikhin and flight engineer Oleg Kotov.

"Right now, the team is looking at the approach photography that you saw th=
e station crew take," said John Shannon, chairman of NASA's mission managem=
ent team. "I was just up in the imagery lab and nothing really jumped out a=
t us."

Engineers plan to work through the night to analyze the photos and determin=
e whether any additional, "focused" inspections might be needed.

After completing the pitch maneuver, Sturckow piloted Atlantis in a slow lo=
op up to a point about 300 feet directly in front of the station with the s=
huttle's nose pointing toward deep space and its open payload bay toward a =
docking port on the front of the Destiny laboratory module.

=46rom there, he flew the shuttle straight in for docking.

On most flights, rendezvous and docking would be the highlight of a busy da=
y in space. But for Atlantis' crew, docking kicked off an equally busy afte=
rnoon of work to pull the 36,000-pound S3/S4 solar array truss segment from=
 the shuttle's cargo bay so it could be handed off to the station's robot a=
rm and safely "parked" overnight. The arm-to-arm handoff was completed arou=
nd 8:30 p.m.

The massive segment will be attached to the right side of the station's mai=
n power truss on Monday just before the start of a spacewalk by Jim Reilly =
and Danny Olivas to make critical electrical connections and prepare the ne=
w arrays for deployment Tuesday. Once extended, the panels will stretch 240=
 feet from tip to tip.

An identical set of arrays was attached to the left side of the main power =
truss last September. The new arrays, and the relocation of a third set of =
solar panels later this year, are required to generate the power needed to =
support the long-awaited delivery of European and Japanese research modules=
 late this year and early next.

Atlantis' crew plans spacewalks Monday, Wednesday and Friday to complete th=
e outfitting and activation of the new S3/S4 solar array segment and to per=
form a variety of other assembly tasks. They also will assist, if necessary=
, work to retract the P6-2B solar panel so the arrays can be moved to the l=
eft end of the power truss later this year.

One wild card in the crew's flight plan is what, if anything, NASA managers=
 might decide to do about a pulled-up insulation blanket on the upper secti=
on of Atlantis' left-side Orbital Maneuvering System rocket pod. Engineers =
have not yet completed their assessment of the blanket or what techniques s=
pacewalking astronauts might employ to address the problem.
