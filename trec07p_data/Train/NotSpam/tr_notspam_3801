Could well be.  I was going by the work-around
described earlier where one line of code needed to be
modified. Line 127 ?

A recent update of Hmisc appears to have this mod.

Me too, but I had not used SAS in about 10-12 years
and all my experience is with it on mainframes so I
was willing to take whatever I could get.  The last
time I moved a large SAS dataset it was on tape and I
carried it myself. 

Except for losing the variable labels I'd much prefer
just to get it in csv. Unfortunately we have about
1800 variables with incomprehensible names. Whoever
set up the file stuck to the 8 character name
convention from the old days.
