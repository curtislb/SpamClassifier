Thanks for writing back.  Based on your response it sounds
like you don't want to encourage people to make local
limited archives that may not include all dists.

Incidentally, I did read the anonftpsync script many times
before writing to the list.  I just thought there might
be better documentation available somewhere.  I've read
through the entire /mirrors section of the debian.org
site several times.

I'll try to write something that would only mirror a single
archive and then get feedback.

What I'd like is to be able to test a file in the archive to know
whether or not I'm working with an official mirror.  It sounds
like there isn't a good way to do this.
