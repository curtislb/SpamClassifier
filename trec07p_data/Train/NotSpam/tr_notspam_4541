SatCon Provides ''Green'' Power to the Greater Boston Area

Largest Solar Energy System Installation in New England 


BOSTON, Apr 24, 2007 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- SatCon Technology Corporation(R)
(Nasdaq CM: SATC), a developer of power management and system
architecture solutions for the alternative energy and distributed power
markets, reports that its power conditioning units for a 425 kW
photovoltaic solar energy system located on an environmentally
remediated brownfield (brightfield) have been providing highly efficient
"green" power at a Brockton, Massachusetts site since its dedication on
October 26, 2006. This site is also the largest brightfield in the
nation. 

This solar energy system generates an estimated 535 megawatt hours (MWh)
of electricity annually, enough energy to power approximately 71 homes.
The city of Brockton intends to build upon its solar leadership by
expanding the solar energy power plant to an associated brownfield.
Eventually the city plans to increase the Brockton Brightfield's
capacity to 1 megawatt (MW). 

Congressman Stephen F. Lynch (D-MA), who helped to secure nearly
$800,000 for the Brockton Brightfield and attended its dedication, said,
"With the opening of the Brightfield, the City of Brockton has now
positioned itself as a nationwide leader in developing and promoting
alternative energy sources. That success was largely due to the hard
work and ingenuity of the people at SatCon, who developed technology
that was critical to this project. At a time of instability in the
worldwide oil markets and rising gas and oil prices, that's a mission
all American cities and companies should be focused on." 

Landerholm Electric, the Brockton-based electrical contractor that
installed the system as a sub-contractor to Global Solar stated, "We are
very pleased with the performance of the SatCon 225 kW inverters
installed at this site. The units were easy to install and have
performed reliably and to our expectations. It is also always good to
work with local Massachusetts-based firms and we appreciate the support
SatCon has provided to the project," said Daniel Smith of Landerholm
Electric.
