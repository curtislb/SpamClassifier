I agree totally.

Moreover, I think the current d-i appearance is really nice (except
maybe for the non-aligned language/country selection dialog) and
combining the current desktop theme with it would not work.  The most
important concern from my side is that d-i uses the default Gnome GTK
engine which has been vetted by the Gnome usability guys.

If we should decide to have a new desktop artwork for lenny, we could
consider mentioning artists /could/ think about integrating their
artwork with the installer under the constraints you mention, but I
don't think the installer should be held hostage here - if the lenny
desktop theme does not work for the installer, so be it.
