Hi, 

Yes, I'm aware that the problem is that I have differing number of
columns in the different datasets. My question still remains. Is there
some way I can allow column numbers to be different, or is there some
other way combining these datasets?

Thanks,
-Jouni

It's because the dataframes have differing number of columns, and that
has not been allowed for in the error message in that version of R.

Not so: rbind on data frames does no such conversion, and is not
problematic provided they have the same column names (and hence the same
number of columns).  You may have missed in ?rbind

      The functions 'cbind' and 'rbind' are S3 generic, with methods for
      data frames.  The data frame method will be used if at least one
      argument is a data frame and the rest are vectors or matrices.
...

and a later description of the data frame method for 'rbind'.
