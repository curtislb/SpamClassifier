Dear RefWorks User, 

Your 30-day trial subscription to RefWorks is about to expire. We hope you have enjoyed using RefWorks.  If you would like to purchase a one year subscription go to www.refworks.com/content/path_learn/purchase.asp and fill out the appropriate information. We will contact you for payment details.  The cost is $100 USD per year, which includes upgrades and free technical support.

This is the last email you will receive before your account is automatically deleted.  If you are interested in purchasing a subscription, please contact us as quickly as possible so we can provide you with uninterrupted service.

If you believe your RefWorks account should be part of an Institutional subscription, please contact us so we can assist you in transferring your account.

If we do not hear from you, your account and database will be deleted and cannot be recovered.
