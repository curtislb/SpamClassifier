Thank you for pointing out .. but we have already tried it!
Unfortunately, it failed to seperate the records in the right fashion.
We have also tried the several more modules from CPAN.. and they were
not able to parse the OutLook's CSV. 

If you read my mail again, you might find that I already mentioned that
we tried several modules before falling back to writing our own code.

What I am expecting is help with the variant of the regex I used as the
condition for while loop. I am sure If we modify that regexp a little
bit, then we can just use it on the record like this :

$_ = $record;
@fields = /regexp/g;

I tried a lot of different ways but just could not get the right
regexp :-(.
