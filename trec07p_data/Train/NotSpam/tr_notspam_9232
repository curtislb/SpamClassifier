I believe I've gotten good results with penalties that are the SQUARE of 
the amount by which the constraints were violated.  These are 
continuously differentiable and so don't confuse the derivative-based 
optimizers much. 

Also, I start with a small penalty, then increase the penalty until I 
get a solution that seems sensible.  If you can't handle a solution just 
a little outside your constraints, shrink a little the place at which 
the penalty starts. 

      Hope this helps.
