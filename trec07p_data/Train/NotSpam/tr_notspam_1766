iron-kurton wrote with a link to an AP story about a national initiative
to [0]scrap the internet and start over. You may remember our discussion
last month about [1]Stanford's Clean Slate Design project; this article
details similar projects across the country, all with the federal
government's blessing and all with the end goal of revamping our current
networking system. From the article: "No longer constrained by slow
connections and computer processors and high costs for storage,
researchers say the time has come to rethink the Internet's underlying
architecture, a move that could mean replacing networking equipment and
rewriting software on computers to better channel future traffic over the
existing pipes. Even Vinton Cerf, one of the Internet's founding fathers
as co-developer of the key communications techniques, said the exercise
was 'generally healthy' because the current technology 'does not satisfy
all needs.'"

[0]Roland Piquepaille writes "If you want to predict how a tall building
can resist to an earthquake, some researchers have better tools than
others. Engineers from the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) have
built a full-size 275-ton building and really shaken it to obtain
[1]earthshaking images. The building was equipped with some 600 sensors
and filmed as the shake table simulated the 1994 Northridge earthquake in
Los Angeles, California. It gave so much data to the engineers to analyze
that they needed a supercomputer to help them. Now they hope their study
will yield to better structure performance for future buildings in case
of earthquakes."

[0]believes his bosses are making a mistake in taking Viacom content off
of YouTube. Today, NBC employee and Saturday Night Live creator Lorne
Michaels has stated he [1]can't understand NBC's position on YouTube. The
interview with Michaels is especially interesting, because it was a
Saturday Night Live clip of the infamous 'Lazy Sunday' music video that
is often credited with putting YouTube on the map. At the same time,
however, almost everyone admitted that it did wonders in revitalizing
SNL's reputation (as well as boosting Andy Samberg's reputation to new
heights). Yet, NBC's lawyers [2]shot it down, limiting the benefit to
SNL. It appears that Michaels understands that, and says [3]he wishes
they could put more of the show on YouTube."

[0]wattsup writes "The LA Times reports that a [1]single wrong command
sent to the wrong computer address caused a cascade of events that led to
the loss of the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft last November. The
command was an orientation instruction for the spacecraft's main
communications antenna. The mistake caused a problem with the positioning
of the solar power panels, which in turned caused one of the batteries to
overheat, shutting down the solar power system and draining the batteries
some 12 hours later. 'The review panel found the management team followed
existing procedures in dealing with the problem, but those procedures
were inadequate to catch the errors that occurred. The review also said
the spacecraft's onboard fault-protection system failed to respond
correctly to the errors. Instead of protecting the spacecraft, the
programmed response made it worse.'"

geddes writes "World chess champion turned opposition leader Gary
Kasparov was [0]arrested this morning while leading an march through
Moscow in opposition to Russian President Vladamir Putin. Kasporov is a
leader of the 'Other Russia' coalition which has been banned by the
government from appearing on TV, and had been denied a marching permit.
>From the New York Times: 'Essentially barred from access to television,
members of Other Russia have embraced street protests as the only
platform to voice their opposition ahead of parliamentary elections in
December and presidential elections next March. Early this month, Mr.
Kasyanov's and Mr. Kasparov's Web sites were blocked, though it was
unclear by whom.' Kasparov was [1]later released from detention, though
he was still fined for participating in the event."
