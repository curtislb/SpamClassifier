i sit on nicholas's side of the fence. maybe i've been working on
windows too long, but this is the behavior i've come to expect. if a
function is not meant for public consumption, why is it available?
let's learn from the mistakes of previous designers and earlier
technologies.

when designing and implementing parrot's embedding/extending api, it'd
be nice if the linker failed on platforms other than windows. this
patch will accomplish that nicely.
