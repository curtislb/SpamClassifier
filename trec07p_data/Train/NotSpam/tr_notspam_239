So the numbers you are generating are not according to the studied properties of the generator you are nominally using. People who study random number generation worry about this sort of thing. You would not be able to claim you are using any particular scheme, which would be a problem if you want to rely on the results or publish them.
My guess is that the numbers might be quite random, perhaps even hard to reproduce (which is another problem). But my guess is not something you would want to claim as authoritative.
