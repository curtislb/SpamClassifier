Hey Tim,

Yeah, BY & SA allow use and waivers a compulsory collection when the =
jurisdiction allows, thanks for clarifying that.  Also, I've personally =
tripped over the NC license and internet radio play.  A friend of mine =
runs an internet radio station and wanted to support CC music, =
unfortunately the stuff he'd earmarked originated from ccMixter and was =
for the most part NC licensed.  The nightmare of gaining permission from =
each artist, then having to pay compulsory royalty anyway, and having to =
allow for attribution etc rendered the whole thing a non-starter.

I'll hopefully persuade him to take up some BY & SA alternative tunes, =
then he can justify the additional time and investment (trading off free =
play against catering for CC attribution and licensing stipulations).

Kev =20

Well, if you licence the musical work with BY or BY-SA, then the radio =

Bear in mind that NC doesn't mean that third parties can *never* use =

IANAL, ATINLA.

Cheers,

Tim
