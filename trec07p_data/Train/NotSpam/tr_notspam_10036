Even if it's "only" ugly: To what advantage? I don't think ugliness is a 
good characteristic of a programming language.

I hope so. I could only find the counterparts for __PACKAGE__ etc. in 
S02. I didn't find the one for e.g. $<.

Reason? I still haven't seen a good justification for sigils.
To allow arrays and scalars and subs to have the same name (besides the 
sigil) although they have different content? No good idea I think.
I also can't remember that I ever named a variable like a "reserved 
word" or operator. And even if I could, I'd consider it to be bad style.

Oh, really? Source? :)
I think they were invented to allow easier parsing and not easier coding.
E.g. in JavaScript, Python, Ruby and Groovy they are optional or even 
don't exist. As I said, there are much more cases where you wouldn't 
need them but have to write them than vice versa.
Optional semicolons save keystrokes, eye pain and stupid syntactic 
errors. And if you still like them, you could just use them, which is 
the definition of "optional".

Oh, if I didn't like Perl, why should I care about posting my ideas here?
Perl has stolen the largest part of the language from other languages.
Why not do so again by adopting good ideas.

Admittedly I'm much too late and I didn't expect applause for my critics 
-- but at least I hoped to get a discussion based on arguments.

Unfortunately I already thought this. Even if everyone agreed that 
sigils (or forced semicolons, or tons of operators, ...) are more bad 
than good (and this seems like persuading the pope to allow homosexual 
muslims to marry with priests) the design process is probably too far to 
introduce such dramatic changes.
Sadly.
