For all of this contains, mere aggregation, use and the like, what is wrong 
with the concept I put forth which is "if a copyright arises" - that is, 
copyright law may already have the answer. If the work under the CC SA 
license is used in a work where a new copyright comes into being, that is 
what we should concern ourselves with. If no new copyright comes into 
existence, it is not a problem.

Is this not a reasonable way to look at it? Strenghts? Weaknesses?
