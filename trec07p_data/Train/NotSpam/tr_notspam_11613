First, I agree with Martin's analysis, or rather with his
resumé of the language lawyers' view.

Second, I wonder: Martin, can you clarify something?  When you
say "I personally wish it wouldn't be necessary", do you mean
"I personally wish that it were proven and accepted that the
socalled 'binary XML' format(s) were unnecessary"?  or do you
mean "I personally wish that the language lawyers would not be
such idiots, and that it were generally accepted that this
particular view of "character encoding", and this particular
use of the XML encoding declaration, is unnecessary, and that
binary XML formats should not need to pretend to be
"character encodings" in the sense of the XML specification?
