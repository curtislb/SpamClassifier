Jamie will have to respond on this one.  It'd be convenient to have the
xmp hidden (Tracker wouldn't index it twice), but following the current
convention, which I wasn't aware of, would be best.

I'm not sure what can be done about this one.  For each file that is
indexed, a separate process is spawned.

Ah, I'll make sure to use that.
