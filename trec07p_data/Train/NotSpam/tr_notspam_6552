: I suppose.  Still, an easier solution might be to allow an optional
: second parameter for .can that takes a signature object:
: 
:  if $obj.can('fribble', :(string -> BadPoet)) {
:    my BadPoet $jibbet = $obj.fribble('repeatedly');
:  }
: 
: Or you could allow signatures to be attached to strings:
: 
:  # pseudo-code:
:  if $obj.can('fribble':(string -> BadPoet)) {
:    my BadPoet $jibbet = $obj.fribble('repeatedly');
:  }
: 
: In effect, the signature gets attached as a property of the string,
: and 'can()' checks for the signature property.
: 
: The only problem that I have with this idea is that I can't think of
: any uses for a "signatory string" outside of '.can()'.

The fundamental problem here is that we're forcing a method name to be
represented as a string.  We're basically missing the &foo equivalent
for methods.  Maybe we need to allow the & indirection on method names
too:

    if $obj.&fribble:(Str --> BadPoet) {

In addition to allowing the :() signature addition already used by
&foo syntax, this would also allow for assumed arguments:

    &callit := $obj.&foo.assuming(1,2,3);
    callit();

One could go as far as to claim that &foo:(Foo: Bar --> Baz) should
be able to figure out that the presence of an invocant means you're
trying to ref a single dispatch to an object that will match type Foo.

Note that we already define &foo:(Int, Str) to return a list of candidates
if there's more than one, so extending this from the multi dispatcher
to the single dispatcher just seem like a SMOS (small matter of syntax).

And then we basically just can the .can method since it'd be redundant.

: I'll assume that you meant to include a variable name on the second line:
: 
:  subset ReallyABadPoet where { $^N.type eq "BadPoet" }
:  my ReallyABadPoet $obj2 = $obj.fribble('repeatedly');

: As I understand it, Perl 6's typing system does not do "duck typing" -
: that is, it uses ".does()" as its primary means of type-checking, not
: ".can()".  As such, you can check an object's type directly without
: having to examine its set of methods - just scan the set of roles that
: the object composes until you find the role that you're looking for.
: 
: Or am I misunderstanding you?

I see this as almost exactly equivalent to the race conditions you
run into trying to determine if you ought to be able to access a file
without actually trying to access it.  Eventually you just have to
call the silly thing and see if it fails, since (especially with active
code) candidates can decide to fail all on their own after you initiate
the call, and since you don't know how many times that happens compared
to the length of your candidate list, predicting whether there will
be a next candidate to try is something akin to the halting problem.

The & syntax is basically saying, "do as much as you can with the
information you've got to trim down the candidate list, but don't
actually do more than that, and certainly don't attempt to actually
call any of the candidates".

: As I understand it, yes; a Float would be cast into an Int in this
: case.  Though my understanding is that this says more about Ints and
: Nums than it does about objects in general.

Hmm, well, "returns Int" is explicitly asking for a coercion of the
return value, so it's at least as general as the coercion semantics
of the type system.  (Which doesn't contradict what you just said,
of course.)  However, that particular syntax doesn't advertise the
Int type as return value to the outside world, which means it could
not be used to trim a candidate list even if the provided sig filter
specified a return type.  Need to use an --> (an "of" type) for that...
