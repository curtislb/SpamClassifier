Ethiopia wants British Queen to return royal bones
Sun 3 Jun 2007, 9:01 GMT
 
[-] Text [+] By Andrew Heavens

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopia has called on Britain's Queen Elizabeth to
return the bones of an orphan prince buried at Windsor Castle after he was
spirited from his homeland by British soldiers nearly 140 years ago.

Prince Alemayehu was just seven in 1868 when his father, Emperor Tewodros
II, committed suicide after being defeated by British troops at the Battle
of Magdala. The prince was placed on a ship to Britain and enrolled in
boarding school.

 He died aged 18 of suspected pleurisy, a lung condition, in the northern
city of Leeds, after years of loneliness.

In the latest Ethiopian drive to reclaim stolen artefacts and relics, the
government in Addis Ababa has written to Britain's queen, asking her to send
home Alemayehu's remains.

Mulugeta Aserate, second cousin of Ethiopia's last emperor Haile Selassie,
who helped organise the appeal, said it was time the wrongs of the last
millennium were put right.

"The prince was a prisoner of war," he told Reuters. "His return would ease
the minds of lots of Ethiopians who believe his rightful resting place
should be here with his father."

A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman declined to discuss the request. "We never
comment on private correspondence to the queen and any response that may
have been given," she said.

The prince -- who claimed a bloodline stretching back to King Solomon and
the Queen of Sheba -- was seized by a British force that invaded to free
European diplomats, missionaries and adventurers jailed by Emperor Tewodros.

"NO HAPPY LIFE"

The emperor took his own life as the troops stormed his mountain fortress in
Magdala. Alemayehu's ailing mother, Queen Terunish, died a few days later as
the soldiers moved to the Red Sea coast with the rest of the royal family.

After studying at Rugby School in the British Midlands, the prince began
officer training at Sandhurst military academy. He died in November 1879 at
the home of one of his tutors.

Queen Victoria had befriended the boy before his death.

"It is too sad!," she wrote in her journal at the time. "All alone in a
strange country, without a single person or relative belonging to him ...
His was no happy life."

The young prince was buried in the crypt of St George's Chapel at Windsor
Castle.

The letter is the latest in a string of requests by Ethiopia for the return
of human remains and hundreds of illuminated manuscripts, gold crowns and
other artefacts stolen by British troops during the 1868 expedition.

The National Army Museum in London still has a lock of Emperor Tewodros'
hair, cut from his corpse as a souvenir by an army artist. Queen Elizabeth's
own library in Windsor Castle holds six sacred illuminated manuscripts that
were taken from Magdala before it was burned to the ground.

For years, Ethiopia fought a war of words to win back a 1,700-year-old
obelisk that was carried to Rome by Italian fascist invaders in the 1930s.
It was returned in April 2005.

In his letter to Queen Elizabeth, Ethiopian President Girma Wolde-Giorgis
asked for the prince's bones to be sent home before his country's millennium
celebrations this September.

Ethiopia observes an archaic calendar that is seven years behind most of the
world -- so the year 2000 will not arrive until September 12, 2007.

Surrender in Theft of 1823 Atlas
Associated Press 05.31.07, 3:22 PM ET

 
A former curator at the Rockland County Historical Society was arrested
Thursday and charged with stealing the society's $60,000 antique U.S. atlas.

Rebecca Chen, 50, of Highland Park, N.J., complied with a prearranged
surrender at Clarkstown police headquarters and was arraigned in Town Court
on a charge of second-degree larceny, said Detective Robert Schine.

Police reported last week that the book had been recovered and a suspect
identified, but her name was not made public until Thursday.

Schine said that on April 22, Chen took the 1823 book, "A New American
Atlas," from a storage area at the Historical Society in New City, where she
had worked for several years until last fall.

"She basically just walked out with it," the detective said.

The atlas, published by Henry Tanner, is one of the earliest American
atlases with large maps of the separate states.

Once the theft was noticed, dealers in antiquarian books were notified.
Christopher Lane of the Philadelphia Print Shop called police when he
received an e-mail from Chen about the atlas.

"He was a great help," Schine said.

Police asked Lane to arrange a viewing of the book, and when Chen came to
the shop with it, the Clarkstown detective was there to confront her.

"She seemed a little surprised," Schine said Thursday. Asked whether she
expressed any regret for the theft, he said, "Whenever you get caught, you
regret it."

He said he did not know of any particular motive for the theft.

Chen was currently employed at the William Trent House Museum in Trenton,
N.J., the detective said. She was allowed to surrender because she did not
seem to be a flight risk and arresting her in Philadelphia would have meant
extradition proceedings, he added.

"She cooperated with us and we decided we would let her turn herself in," he
said.

Chen did not have a lawyer in court Thursday and no plea was entered, Schine
said. She was ordered held on $5,000 bail for another court appearance
Monday, by which time a public defender was to be assigned to the case.

Find Whitey: the hunt for the man with a $1m price on his head


UK expert on the trail of godfather suspected of masterminding $350m art
heist 

Sandra Laville in Las Palmas
Monday June 4, 2007
The Guardian 


"No, the legs are wrong. The walk is wrong. He'd be wearing a hat, and
sunglasses, always sunglasses."
Along the two-mile promenade of Playa de las Canteras, elderly men with
white hair and skin the colour of worn leather pass the time of day with
friends. Some walk purposefully along the beach skirting the surf line,
baseball hats pulled down on their heads. Others sit on benches smoking
cigarettes.

Secreted here, amid the sweep of hotels, facades of broken-down buildings
and surfers' haunts, is a British art crime investigator working under the
pseudonym Chris Roberts to protect his anonymity. Nearing 60, he is a loner,
with strong contacts in the criminal underworld and a reputation for finding
what he seeks. He is convinced he will know the man he wants when he sees
him. The legs will be distinctive, strong and significantly bowed, lending
an unmistakeable sway to the walk. The face will be chiselled, the arms
muscular despite his 77 years and the blue eyes hidden behind aviator
sunglasses. He will be carrying a knife.

For 12 years James "Whitey" Bulger has evaded capture. The violent and
feared godfather of the Irish mob in Boston, Massachusetts, Whitey fled the
US in 1995 after being tipped off by a corrupt FBI agent, John Connolly,
that an indictment was heading his way. With Connolly now in jail in the US,
Whitey, so named because of his slick of white hair, is wanted for 19
murders, violating the laws against organised crime, extortion, drug dealing
and money laundering, all committed from the early 1970s to the mid-80s.
Considered armed and extremely dangerous, he ranks in the top 10 of the
FBI's list of most-wanted villains and carries a $1m (?500,000) bounty.
In 12 years the FBI's Bulger taskforce has searched England, Ireland,
France, Italy, Thailand and Brazil for Whitey - the man on whom Martin
Scorsese is said to have modelled Frank Costello, played by Jack Nicholson
in the Oscar-winning film The Departed.


What might appear to be a search for a needle in a haystack has recently
focused on Spain. The US attorney in Boston, Michael Sullivan, will not
comment on the investigation but it is understood a Spanish arrest warrant
has been issued for Bulger and investigators from the justice department
have recently travelled to the Canary Islands in the hunt for him.

What brings Roberts, one of Britain's leading specialist art crime
investigators, to Gran Canaria dates back to 1990 in Boston, a city where
nothing moved in the underworld without the Irish godfather knowing about
it.

In the early hours of March 18, as Boston's St Patrick's Day celebrations
drew to a close, two thieves, dressed in ill-fitting police uniforms,
carried out one of the biggest art heists in history.

Thirteen paintings worth $350m - including Rembrandt's only seascape, The
Storm on the Sea of Galilee, The Concert by Jan Vermeer, Landscape with an
Obelisk by Govaert Flinck, five Degas drawings and a Manet portrait - were
stolen from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum.

The thieves handcuffed and bound the guards and ripped the canvases from the
frames, leaving the ragged edges of the masterpieces protruding from the
smashed glass and splintered wood.

The crime may have taken place 17 years ago, but the hunt for the paintings
continues. Many investigators believe Bulger was the mastermind. "Find
Whitey and you find the paintings," said Roberts.

Armed with tips from informants, Roberts treads the beaches of Gran Canaria
scanning the groups of old men in their 70s, watches the ferry port and sits
scouring hotel lobbies, a digital camera and a notebook in his pocket. "It's
like a painting, it tells you whether it's real or not if you know what you
are looking for and look closely," he said.

Roberts's success in recovering masterpieces for museums and private
individuals during his 30-year career belies the hard work and tedium of the
traditional gumshoe. Hunting for a fugitive requires good informants,
patience, instinct, tenacity and an ability to take repeated, crushing
disappointments. Investigators immerse themselves in the lives of their
subject in an attempt to get inside their minds. In Bulger's case the FBI
lists his predilections as walking on beaches, exercise, historical
buildings, libraries and a love of animals.

"He will be in a place away from the tourists, somewhere with a slightly
seedy edge, where he can walk along the beach unnoticed and have control
over his surroundings," said Roberts. "What he won't want is to draw
attention to himself. He is very proud of his physique, so will be keeping
fit. He has to be in a place where he can escape quickly, not some small
village where he would stand out and could be trapped."

Roberts is one of at least two British experts trying to crack one of the
art world's greatest mysteries. Other freelance bounty hunters are also
looking for the paintings, attracted by the $5m reward for the safe return
of the works.

Unlike most crimes, where the trail goes cold the longer the investigation
continues, when it comes to high-value art thefts, the years that pass make
a breakthrough more likely. "You are not looking for the thieves. It is the
handlers you want, the people who have hold of the art and have laid it down
to await further instructions," Roberts said.

Contacted last year by the US attorney in Boston, he has visited Spain and
the Canaries four times in his search. In October last year he believed he
had spotted the fugitive in a rundown part of Alicante, exercising in the
early morning on the seafront. "When I saw him I took pictures, and went
back and watched again. It was his walk that gave him away, I was convinced
it was him."

He took several photographs, contacted the lead investigator from the US
attorney's justice department in Boston and sent off the pictures. "It took
seven weeks for them to turn up in Spain," he said. A return visit by
Roberts during a wet, cold November drew a blank. "By then I think he was
long gone."

Accusations abound that the FBI and the US attorney's justice department
have been leaden-footed in the 12-year manhunt, fuelled by the history of
the mobster's relationship with the bureau. For nearly two decades Bulger
was a top-tier secret FBI informant and as such was given protection by his
corrupt handler, Connolly, from prosecution by other agencies, including the
police. The allegation is that the last thing many within the FBI want is to
find Bulger and stir memories of the rampant corruption within the agency in
the city.

As for the paintings, sources within the art crime underworld and the Garda
believe they have been laid down in a secret hideaway in the west of
Ireland, a result of strong links between Bulger's Irish mafia in Boston and
senior figures within the IRA leadership at the time.

"If Bulger is caught there is no need for those who hold the paintings to
hang on to them," said Roberts. "That is the moment you are likely to have a
breakthrough. At the moment it is not worth the lives of those holding the
art to do anything differently from what they have been told by the people
who are supporting Whitey's fugitive status."

A security source within the art world said the paintings may be used as a
bartering tool by known criminals. "Art thefts in general are often carried
out not for actual cash but for collateral for drugs or bartering your way
out of charges," said the source. "People steal art, store it away and hold
on to it. When they get into trouble, they use it as a means of trying to
get out of trouble."

It is known that before he fled America, Bulger travelled to Ireland, the UK
and elsewhere in Europe, leaving money and other possessions in deposit
boxes as a means of support when on the run. Scotland Yard became involved
in the case, the Guardian understands, when one of the many boxes deposited
by Bulger was found in the security vaults of a bank near Piccadilly Circus.
Inside, officers found $50,000 and the key to another deposit box in Dublin.
In Boston, the head of security at the Gardner museum, Anthony Amore,
believes the $5m reward will eventually attract vital information."There are
a number of investigations going on," said Mr Amore. "Primarily, the FBI has
the jurisdiction, and they are heading up the investigation into the theft.

"From our perspective I will walk over broken glass to get the paintings
back. We are optimistic. There are a number of very good people who are
investigating the theft and issues around it," he said. He went on to name
Roberts and another Briton.

But for Roberts the hunt ended in Gran Canaria, albeit temporarily, in
disappointment and a trail gone cold. His continued conviction, however,
that Bulger holds the key to finding the art comes as no surprise to museum
staff.

"He was the main crime boss in Boston at the time, he knew everything that
went on," said a museum source. "No one really knows what the FBI are up to,
they don't tell us, but his name certainly cannot be ruled out."

Today, the empty frames of the paintings still hang on the museum walls. A
notice next to the space where once Vermeer's The Concert hung reads: "On
the night of March 18 1990 thieves stole 13 priceless works of art including
The Concert and The Storm on the Sea of Galilee. Anyone with information is
asked to contact the FBI."

Mr Amore often pauses to stare at the empty frames. "We like to look at
those empty frames as place holders for our art," he said. "They are not
there to mourn the loss of the paintings, but to hold a place for those
important pieces which we are sure will one day be returned to the Gardner
collection."

Witness fingers Japanese museum in Italian art-trafficking case
Kazuki Matsuura / Yomiuri Shimbun Correspondent

The expert witness for the prosecution in a trial in Italy over the
trafficking of stolen art objects to the United States has claimed a
Japanese museum is housing items unearthed illegally in Italy. 

As the witness named the Miho Museum in Koka, Shiga Prefecture, the Italian
prosecutors likely will begin a full-scale investigation into possible
trafficking of stolen items into Japan, sources said. 

The expert, who has been investigating trafficking connected to the J. Paul
Getty Museum in Los Angeles, named the museum in an effort to shed light on
the practice of art objects being illegally dug up and passed on to museums
in countries other than the United States. 

According to the expert, some artwork housed in the Miho Museum, including a
decorative sculpture of marble from ancient Rome, known as an oscilla, were
identified from pictures of stolen items seized from a smuggling syndicate
by the prosecutors. 

The prosecutors have been investigating the smuggling ring, which has sold
antiques illegally unearthed from archaeological sites and other places and
shipped them to museums in Japan, the United States and other countries
since the mid-1990s. The investigation led prosecutors to the United States.


The J. Paul Getty Museum is believed to have obtained many antiques from a
syndicate based in Switzerland, and a curator and an American antique art
dealer were charged with smuggling as they are believed to have cooperated
with the syndicate. The trial is taking place in a Rome criminal court. 

The Italian prosecutors have also confirmed a Japanese antique art dealer
was involved in dealing between the syndicate and Japanese museums, sources
said. 

The investigators are said to be trying to match seized pictures with
suspicious items housed in several Japanese museums. 

Nobuo Tsuji, director of the Miho Museum, said: "I don't think all artwork
housed in our museum has a legal problem. But if the Italian government
officially asks us to return certain items, we'll consider how to proceed
then."

Palace ecstatic queen's gem recovered


Sun Jun 3 2007

By Gabrielle Giroday

 
 
THE director of the Austrian museum from where a diamond brooch was stolen
nearly a decade ago said he's relieved to know the heirloom is in safe hands
-- even if he wasn't aware it had been recovered in Winnipeg. 
"We've had a few calls all these years where people claimed to have found
it, and it came to nothing," said Franz Sattlecker, the director of
Schonbrunn Palace, where the diamond-encrusted brooch belonging to a
legendary queen named Empress Elisabeth disappeared during a daylight
robbery in 1998. 

He said he had no clue the brooch had been found by Winnipeg police. 

"Every two or three years we got some offers from different people who
wanted to sell it to us," said Sattlecker. "We just accepted the fact the
star had been stolen." 

The brooch had been on loan to the museum from a private collector for an
exhibit and kept in a glass container with an alarm. 

"We are happy that it's back," he said. "It is an important piece, and it
was very unpleasant (when we lost it)... it was such a long time ago."    
Schonbrunn is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site where fans of 'Sisi' --
Elisabeth's nickname -- can visit. 

The brooch was one of about 30 hairpins the dramatic queen of Austria, who
reigned from 1854 to 1898, wore in her hair for portrait sittings, he said. 

The missing pin was recovered in Winnipeg last week in a modest St. James
home as part of a far-reaching investigation by police officers across
Canada. 

On Friday, investigators announced charges against an alleged criminal ring
that participated in "millions and millions" of dollars of global robbery
and fraud. 

Police released the names of eight people, aged 21 to 83, charged in
connection with an alleged string of bank robberies, credit card fraud, and
mortgage fraud. 

None of the charges has been proven in court. 

Gerald Daniel Blanchard, the 35-year-old Vancouver man who is alleged to be
the leader of the 'Blanchard gang', is facing 41 charges. 

He's been in custody at Headingley Correctional Centre since January. He was
charged last week with conspiracy to kidnap and murder his one-time
girlfriend, Lynette Tien of Vancouver, one of the eight people charged in
connection with the ring. Blanchard grew up in Omaha, Neb., and has a
grandmother who lives in Winnipeg, whom family members said he visited
periodically. Police searched her home in St. James earlier this year, the
Free Press reported Wednesday. 

Blanchard's lawyer Danny Gunn did not say whether the St. James house where
police say the brooch was seized is the same house where Blanchard's
grandmother lives. 

"The family's been pretty much ripped apart by all of this," said Gunn, who
called the charges against his client "ludicrous." 

"It's been very difficult for them."

Ethiopia seeks prince's remains 
By Elizabeth Blunt 
BBC News, Addis Ababa  



Ethiopia's president has sent Queen Elizabeth II a formal request for the
remains of a prince who died in Britain more than a century ago. 
The royal household at Windsor Castle, where Prince Alemayehu was buried, is
said to be considering the request. 

President Woldegiorgis Girma hopes the prince's bones can be reburied for
millennium celebrations in September. 

Ethiopia has been waging a lively campaign to get back historic treasures
looted during the last two centuries. 

Father's suicide 

Its most striking success has been in recovering a massive stone obelisk
from Axum, carried off to Rome by Mussolini's army. 

But the campaign now has a new impetus. 

Ethiopia's calendar is more than seven years behind that of the rest of the
world - here, it is still 1999 and Ethiopians are planning to mark what they
believe is the 2000 anniversary of the birth of Christ with big celebrations
in September. 


 [Prince Alemayehu] was buried at Windsor Castle, with Queen Victoria
describing as "too sad" his short life and early death 
 

Now the Ethiopian president has put in a formal request for the return of
the remains of Prince Alemayehu. 

His father, the Emperor Tewodros II, committed suicide after his defeat by
the British at the Battle of Magdala in 1868. 

The young boy was taken to Britain and sent to boarding school and officers'
training school at Sandhurst, but died at the age of 18. 

He was buried at Windsor Castle, with Queen Victoria describing as "too sad"
his short life and early death. 

The Ethiopian embassy in London says Windsor is now considering their
request. 

The young prince was not the only thing the British took from Magdala - they
reportedly needed 15 elephants and nearly 200 mules to carry away the
treasures that Tewodros had accumulated. 

Many of them are still in Britain and the Queen has some of them - notably
six of the very finest illuminated manuscripts, which are part of the royal
collection in Windsor Castle.
