While installing R (version 2.4.0) on my Dell desktop (Optiplex GX 270)on a Ubuntu Linux platform, I had followed the advice contained in thefollowing link:http://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/debian/README
Briefly, what I had done is the following:
I had added "deb http://cran.R-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu dapper/" tomy "/etc/apt/sources.list" and then did
$ sudo apt-get update$ sudo apt-get upgrade$ sudo apt-get install r-base
Since my R installation is broken, my questions are: 
(1)should I re-install R as above or do I need to install manually? Iwould of course prefer using apt-get. 
(2)should I also install the r-commended bundle? I did not do this lasttime and as Peter has pointed out, this might have caused the problem.
