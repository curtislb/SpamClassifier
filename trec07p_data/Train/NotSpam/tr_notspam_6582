Right, well, the clutter (if you can even call it that) isn't really my main 
problem with the OT posts. My main problem is that I think this list has 
become the de-facto list for blind linux user questions and it has all but 
killed off the blinux list. That's a shame because:
1. That list is a lot more publicized
2. It actually is for general linux questions for the blind

If you google "blind linux user"  the first couple of links are for the 
blinux list. I don't know how far you have to go down before you find a link 
to this list but it's more than a handful. I'm afraid that blind linux users 
are going to find the blinux list and conclude that there isn't much of an 
active blind linux user community.  And even if they find this list, they 
would conclude that it's about speakup. Not about orca or emacspeak.

I don't know how many people on this list are also on the blinux list. Not 
too many I think.   But every once in a while you get someone asking how to 
get started with linux. I've  steered some people here saying speakup is 
probably the best way to get started.

I don't know... I just think that if this list is going to be about linux 
for the blind, it should say so. Neatness counts. And the problem isn't 
*really* with my .procmailrc.
