Hi Yaron,

I think what the others are saying is that it's *uninstalling* that is 
dangerous, you should not have any problems because you installed a module.

And also that there's no need to uninstall a module, just stop using it 
and leave the files there.

I've installed a lot of cpan modules over the years and never had it 
cause any problems with other modules. I've never uninstalled a module.

Hope this helps,

Cheers,
Nigel
