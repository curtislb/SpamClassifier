Hey all, I just wanted to write and see if anyone has any good 
recommendations of a USB or PCI synth that works well with 
speakup.  I got a new dell, and was not blessed with having serial 
ports on the motherboard.  I'm gonna install Ubuntu 7.04 tomorrow, so 
if no one can recommend a good synth that will work with speakup, can 
someone point me in the right way of getting it up and running with 
7.04?  There are times when I'd rather work at the command line 
rather than gui.  Thanks in advance for all the help.


Guy
P.S.  I guess I have a couple more questions after downloading and 
burning the ISO.  What is the best way to get firefox 3, and how do 
you go about getting a spoken install with 7.04?  Thanks again for 
all the help.
