Yes, I think that licensor-oriented choice of venue clauses in free software
licenses are at best a bug, and at worst make the license fail the intent of
the DFSG.

However, the ftpmasters appear to disagree, and the practical consequences
of these clauses do not appear so great (nor so persuasive) that I feel the
need to insist there's been an error.
