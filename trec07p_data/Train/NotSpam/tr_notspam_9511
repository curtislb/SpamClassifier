You're making this much more complex than it needs to be.
When first introduced to a buddy, you store his key and name (as given)as immutable, and color/nick/avatar as mutable. We must never depend onjust color/nick/avatar in the UI to identify people; their name, as wehave it stored, must always be displayed alongside their mutableidentifier. If you're IMing with someone who has Bob's picture but thedisplayed name is Alice, you'll know something's wrong. This is thedesign we've discussed from the beginning.
