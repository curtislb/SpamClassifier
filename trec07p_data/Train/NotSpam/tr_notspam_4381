As far as I know, it doesn't matter whether they assert it or not. If a 
copyright can be had on a work these days, you get it automatically whether 
you want it or not.

I think so. Copyright is automatic, right? Or do only certain works or certain 
works get copyright protection automatically while others need to be marked 
or even registered?

Does anyone know the answer to questions like this who would be willing to 
share them?

That would not be necessary, it might conflict with other free licensed works 
that make similar requirements. What you could do is specify acceptable 
licenses for siblings in a collective work and another set of acceptable 
licenses for the collective work itself. In the case of say BY-SA, neither 
the siblings nor the collective would necessarily have to be BY-SA. (Where 
BY-SA is some amended BY-SA and not the one we have now obviously.)

Right, if so, hence my wording along the lines of where a copyright arises or 
where a copyright obtains.

I do not think this is correct, the GPL uses the term mere aggregation.

"In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License."

Unless you refer to some other clause in the GPL. Mere aggregation suggests 
more to me something along the lines of you having a random mixture of songs 
of various licenses and you sort them alphabetically and copy them off to CD 
or DVD with as many as can fit on each disk going on that disk. No 
creativity, hence no copyright arising, mere aggregation.

For Share Alike, what is wanted is share alike. Not coercion. I'm willing to 
share with you if you are willing to share with me under these terms. 
Voluntary. Now, you may not fully like having to meet the share alike terms, 
but that hardly goes to coercion.

To my mind, being wary is very reasonable. I am constantly running upon quirks 
as to how things work.

Could be, I think we would need to have a better understanding of which sorts 
of things get copyrights and which don't in order to better think about these 
issues.

Any experts care to give some lessons? Write a primer?
