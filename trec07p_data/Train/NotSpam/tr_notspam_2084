Hans Reiser is promoting just the unification of files and
directories in his Reiser4 filesystem. In particular does
it support opening a file as a directory for accessing the
file's metadata.

Also think of files that have internal structure like tar
files and libraries. With the matching IO plugin one can
access these files with the same API that is used for unix
style files/directories. In that sense it is a good idea to
provide a fatter interface that has got explicit opendir and
openfile methods in addition to plain open that dwims.

Regards, TSa.
