1. New Law Includes Measures to Address Tax Gap

The Small Business and Work Opportunity Tax Act of 2007 recently signed by the President included three provisions aimed at helping address the federal tax gap.  In general: 

--Section 8243 provides that levies issued to collect federal employment taxes are excepted from pre-levy Collection Due Process (CDP) hearing requirements if the taxpayer previously requested a CDP hearing. (Effective for levies issued 120 days after enactment.)

--Section 8246 broadens tax return preparer penalties to include estate and gift, employment, and excise tax returns, as well as returns of exempt organizations. It also increases the related penalties.  (Effective for tax returns prepared after the date of enactment.)

--Section 8247 imposes a penalty equal to 20 percent of the disallowed portion of erroneous refund claims when there is no reasonable basis. (Effective for claims filed after the date of enactment.)

For more information on the Sections 8243, 8246, and 8247 respectively, go to pages 30-31 and 34-36 in the technical explanation http://www.house.gov/jct/x-29-07.pdf of the Small Business and Work Opportunity Tax Act Of 2007.


2. Summer 2007 SSA/IRS Reporter Now Available

The summer 2007 issue of the SSA/IRS Reporter (Pub 1693), a quarterly newsletter for employers, is now posted on IRS.gov. http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=109886,00.html


3. Latest Tax Gap Fact Sheet Addresses Farm Income and Expense Reporting

Incorrect reporting of farm income and expenses accounts for part of the estimated $345 billion per year in unpaid taxes, according to IRS estimates. 

This fact sheet, http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=171145,00.html  the thirteenth in a series to educate taxpayers on the Tax Gap, http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=158619,00.html  highlights some farming income sources and deductible business expenses.

4. Passive Loss Activities 

Special rules may limit the amount of your deductible loss from a trade, business, rental, or other income-producing activity. 

Generally, a loss from a passive activity http://www.irs.gov/publications/p925/ar02.html#d0e305  (a rental activity or business in which you do not materially participate) http://www.irs.gov/publications/p925/ar02.html#d0e744 cannot be used to offset income from nonpassive http://www.irs.gov/publications/p925/ar02.html#d0e706 activities. 

However, a special allowance for rental real estate activities http://www.irs.gov/publications/p925/ar02.html#d0e915 may allow some losses even if they exceed passive income.
