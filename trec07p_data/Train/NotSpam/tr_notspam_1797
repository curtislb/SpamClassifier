No. They are true for any act that requires permission from the
copyright holder. Distribution is one such act. Copying without
dsitribution is also such an act. Creating a derivative work is
also such an act. And for example in Europe, executing software
is also such an act. 

For most free and open source licenses, only acts that involve
distribution come with conditions. But that is a special case.
