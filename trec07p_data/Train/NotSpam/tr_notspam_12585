Lou Dobbs Tonight
Tuesday, May 22, 2007

Tonight, amendments threaten the immigration deal; Democrats
try to push legislation that would grant amnesty to the
millions of illegal aliens living in this country.

Several provisions written into the Kennedy - Specter amnesty
legislation provide outrageous provisions to illegal aliens
seeking amnesty. One provision would make taxpayers foot the
bill for the legal costs of illegal aliens seeking citizenship
by providing illegal aliens with federally funded lawyers.
Other terms of the legislation would force the government to
grant a Z-visa to gang members. We’ll have full coverage.

Buried in the comprehensive immigration reform compromise is a
provision that would “accelerate” the implementation of the
Security and Prosperity Partnership. We’ll have a full report
on the continuing effort to push what critics call a
sovereignty giveaway behind closed doors.

A Grand Jury in Orange County, California is urging their large
cities to support a program that identifies illegal aliens in
their jails. The grand jury proposed that Immigration and
Customs Enforcement train officers to check the immigration
status of inmates. But the proposal is facing opposition from
some police chiefs who say it would only duplicate the work of
county jails. We’ll have a special report.

Is the Bush administration planning a North American Union? The
Vice President of International Affairs for American
University, Robert Pastor, rejects accusations he is a leading
advocate for a North American Union. He joins Lou.
And, Reps. Brad Sherman (D-CA) and Marcy Kaptur (D-OH) are
outraged over Democratic leaders' free trade deal with the Bush
administration. They join Lou to discuss why the plan is bad
for middle class Americans.
Then, three of the nation's best radio talk show hosts: Joe
Madison, WOL in Washington D.C., Jerry Doyle, KDWN in Las
Vegas, and Steve Malzberg, WOR in New York join Lou.

Visit http://cnn.com/loudobbstonight to read Lou’s
latest commentary on how the separation of church and state in
this country is narrowing.

Lou Dobbs lays out his manifesto to save the middle class in
his new book, “War on the Middle Class: How the Government, Big
Business, and Special Interest Groups Are Waging War on the
American Dream and How to Fight Back.” War on the Middle Class
is now on sale in bookstores near you and on Amazon.com and
BarnesandNoble.com.
