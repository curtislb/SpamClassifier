					Hello,<BR>

						Today's Quote for the Day comes from this morning's speech from David=
 Cameron on what he claimed is the increasingly yobbish and unpleasant natu=
re of British society.=20
<br>

<br>
"All these are sad signs of a culture that is becoming decivilised - and th=
e terrible thing is, we're getting used to it."
<br>

<br>
In tonight's programme:=20
<br>

<br>
<B>YELTSIN</B>
<br>

<br>
When he was in power his colourful attitude to life led to regular predicti=
ons of demise from heart failure.=20
<br>

<br>
Today some seven years after his resignation from office, we finally receiv=
ed news of the death of the former Russian leader Boris Yeltsin - a transit=
ional figure, some might say, between Gorbachev's reforms and the new autho=
ritarianism of Putin. But what really is his legacy?=20
<br>

<br>
<B>CHALLENGER TANKS </B>
<br>

<br>
Mark Urban joins us from Baghdad, where the MoD has confirmed that insurgen=
ts have succeeded in penetrating the hide of a Challenger tank with a roads=
ide bomb.=20
<br>

<br>
What does this now mean for the safety of British troops?=20
<br>

<br>
<B>SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY </B>
<br>

<br>
On the day David Cameron makes a keynote speech about the need of governmen=
t to balance rights with responsibilities, school teacher Angela Mason face=
s a lifetime ban from teaching from the General Teaching Council, the teach=
er's equivalent of being 'struck off.'
<br>

<br>
Her crime? She secretly filmed the bad behaviour routinely encountered in a=
 school for a TV documentary. We'll be speaking to her live.
<br>

<br>
<B>FRANCE </B>
<br>

<br>
Speaking of what government is for, this is clearly a watershed election fo=
r the French Republic and - by extension - for all of Europe. Now we know i=
t is Sego vs Sarko in the final round - what difference will it make?
<br>

<br>
<B>WiFi</B>
<br>

<br>
Some people seem to be super-sensitive to low level microwave radiation.=20
<br>

<br>
So on the day the City of London switches on the Europe's single largest wi=
reless Internet zone, we meet the people who, unless they want to spend the=
ir lives wracked with migraines and nausea, will have to walk around with t=
in foil wrapped around their heads in this brave new world.=20
<br>

<br>
<B>AND FINALLY ...</B>=20
<br>

<br>
Today's Joke Fit For an Eleven Year Old comes from (occasional) Newsnight v=
iewer James (aged 13):
<br>

<br>
"Why is Arsenal FC like a three pin plug? Because they're both useless in E=
urope."
<br>

<br>
Newsnight is at 10.30pm on BBC2.
