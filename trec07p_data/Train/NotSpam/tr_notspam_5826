Probably the OpenSSL Perl module requires that the openssl package be 
installed onto your system.

Hmm, after taking a look at the README file for CPAN's OpenSSL, I think 
that the module is "not ready for prime time." The README is ten lines 
long, contains a curse word and refers to itself as a "hack."

It's so unprofessional, if I didn't know better, I'd think that someone 
had broken into the PAUSE author's account, and I don't know better.
