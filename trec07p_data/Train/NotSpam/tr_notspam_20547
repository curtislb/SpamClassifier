Greg,

That was indeed the problem.  I carried out your steps and it works.  I 
still don't think that software speech under Linux is all that impressive. 
According to my experiences, it is somewhat slow and often dies completely 
if a lot of text is sent to it too quickly.  Could be just my hardware but 
others have had similar experiences.

In the espeak-generic.conf file, should I have left it creating wav files in 
the command line parameter?  I took that out so that text was sent to the 
espeak application directly; seems to me that making wav files would just 
slow the process down even more.

Thanks,
Robby
