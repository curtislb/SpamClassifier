Thank you all for the quick responses.
I have to look into all the new information and will definitely tell  
you of the progress and choices I have to make, to know your opinion  
and act upon it.
Going to reflect it on the vlogger community as well to get the full  
picture.
I'm even more exited now. Thank you again.

greetings Erik
