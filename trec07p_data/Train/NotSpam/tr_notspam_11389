JUSTICE DEPT. DEFENDS BROADER LIST OF TARGETED PROSECUTORS
The Justice Department acknowledged today that as many as 26 U.S. attorneys were on lists for potential dismissal during the past two years, but said the lists were only "thoughts for discussion" by a now-departed aide to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. The process concluded last December with the firing of eight prosecutors -- a move that stirred up a firestorm on Capitol Hill and led to the resignation of Kyle Sampson, Gonzales' chief of staff.  "These lists, some drafted long before the December resignations, reflect Kyle Sampson's thoughts for discussion during the consultation process," Justice Department spokesman Brian Roehrkasse said. "Many names on these lists, which have been shared with Congress, clearly did not represent the final actions or views of the department's leadership of the attorney general," he said. The expanded number of prosecutors whose names appeared on internal lists was first reported by the Washington Post today. The names represented almos!
 t a fourth of the 93 U.S. attorneys nationwide. Although U.S. attorneys are political appointees who serve at the pleasure of the president, the Justice Department's initial characterization of their firings as "performance-related" prompted an outcry from the fired lawyers and raised allegations of political pressure on pending investigations. Gonzales has admitted the dismissals were handled badly, but has denied any wrongdoing and resisted calls for his resignation from members of Congress.

P.M. BLAIR: NO REGRETS ON IRAQ
In his final weeks as prime minister of Britain and at what is likely to be his final news conference in the White House Rose Garden, Tony Blair expressed no regrets today for the steadfast support of President Bush's policy on Iraq that has cost him dearly at home. "I have taken the view that Britain should stand shoulder to shoulder with America," Mr. Blair said. "After September 11th, I have never deviated from that view. I have never regretted that view." Mr. Blair said battles over values are not won "by being a fair-weather friend to your ally or withdrawing support for each other when the going gets tough. You don't win those battles by losing the will to fight if your enemy's will to fight is very  strong or very powerful." But he allowed that "history will judge" whether his support of the U.S.-led attack on Iraq and subsequent occupation was the right move. He and President Bush defended each other's records with zeal. The president said the prime minister stands o!
 ut from many other politicians. "There's a lot of blowhards in the political process," he said. "A lot of hot-air artists, people who've got something fancy to say." Mr. Blair is not among them, he said. "This guy is a very strong, respected leader and he's absolutely the right guy for me to be dealing with." For his part, Mr. Blair called the president "a strong leader at a time when the world needed strong leadership."

DEATH TOLL IN GAZA CLIMBS WITH ISRAELI AIRSTRIKES
At least six Palestinians were killed in six airstrikes by Israel today in retaliation for Qassam rocket attacks from Gaza, Palestinian security sources told CNN. But Israeli military officials only confirm three attacks in which two Palestinians were killed. The latest Israeli airstrikes came as violence ratcheted up between the warring Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah and between Palestinians and Israeli forces, claiming the lives of more than 40 Palestinians since Sunday. In Washington, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to get their views on the latest violence, State Department spokesman Sean McWarwick told reporters. "We want to see a reduction in the violence and restraint on both sides," McWarwick said. Three Qassam rockets fell in the Israeli town of Sderot this morning - one of which fell on a school and left one person lightly wounded, Israeli officials said. Since Monday, as ma!
 ny as 80 rockets have been fired from Gaza into Israel, an IDF spokeswoman said. But even amid Israeli airstrikes, Palestinians loyal to Fatah and those loyal to Hamas are fighting each other. At least 19 Palestinians were killed Wednesday in the fourth day of heavy fighting between the two parties.

DIFFERING REASONS GIVEN FOR IRAQI NEWS MEDIA BAN
The Iraqi government's ban on journalists covering the aftermath of bombings will only keep cameras away from the attack scene for the first two hours "until criminal investigators are done with their work," according to an Iraqi Interior Ministry spokesman. News photographers will still be able to capture video from a distance as long as they do not disturb the crime scene or shoot video of the wounded or dead, Gen. Abdul Karim Khalaf told CNN today. He said the ban is aimed at preserving crime scene evidence and respecting human rights based on international standards. Khalaf's reasoning for the ban, however, differed from that of another Interior Ministry official, Ali Dabbagh. He told CNN this week that the ban was an effort by Iraq's government to control certain news outlets that are trying to ignite sectarian tensions by showing "the blood of the people." Dabbagh said the ban has been put in place as a reaction to some media agencies that "are trying to misuse the tra!
 gedies for Iraqis, and they are trying to exploit this one in a way to ignite a feeling, to ignite the sectarian feeling. It is a war against the terrorists and they are using the media, they are using the camera (as) part of their war against Iraqis, so we should not allow them to use this one," Dabbagh said. "We apologize for the, probably, the effect on a good people, on a good media."

WEATHER PROMPTS NEW CONCERN OVER FLORIDA WILDFIRE
Strong, cool winds from the northeast and the threat of lightning strikes today could spread further the flames of raging Florida wildfires, according to U.S. Forest Service spokesman Jim Caldwell. In a news conference in Lake City, Fla., Caldwell said the largest of those blazes, the Bugaboo Fire has grown to 120,515 acres since it began this month in the northeastern part of the state at the Florida-Georgia state line. The fire, which began in the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge in Georgia about two weeks ago, was 65% contained as of about yesterday afternoon. He warned of "extreme fire behavior with torching and spotting," and predicted that the flames would reach 8 feet in height. He also said the fire would move nearly a mile an hour as it consumed dry brush and pine trees sapped by the extreme drought conditions in the Sunshine State. Across the state, there were 192 active fires burning 186,297 acres, according to a statement from the Florida Division of Forestry.!
  "We have dropped more water and (fire) retardant in Florida than ever before," Caldwell said, adding that almost 700 firefighters and support personnel are battling the state's fires. Six helicopters were to drop water and retardant on the Bugaboo Fire Thursday, he said. So far, 730 homes have been evacuated, and he said several communities are being watched for more possible evacuations if the fire spreads. Those include Five Points, Deep Creek, Benton, Lake City and Watertown in Columbia County, and Moccasin Creek Circle and Taylor in Baker County, Caldwell said.
