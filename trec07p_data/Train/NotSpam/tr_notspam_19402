[ Arrggh, not reply , but reply to all , cross my fingers again , sorry Peter! ]

Hmm,

I don't think you need a retain statement.

if first.patientID ;
or
if last.patientID ;

ought to do it.

It's actually better than the Vilno version, I must admit, a bit more concise:

if ( not firstrow(patientID) ) deleterow ;

Ah well.

**********************************
For the folks asking for location of software ( I know posted it, but
it didn't connect to the thread, and you get a huge number of posts
each day , sorry):

Vilno , find at
http://code.google.com/p/vilno

DAP & PSPP,  find at
http://directory.fsf.org/math/stats

Awk, find at lots of places,
http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/gawk.html

Anything else? DAP & PSPP are hard to find, I'm sure there's more out there!
What about MDX? Nahh, not really the right problem domain.
Nobody uses MDX for this stuff.

******************************************************

If my examples , using clinical trial data are boring and hard to
understand for those who asked for examples
( and presumably don't work in clinical trials) , let me
know. Some of these other examples I'm reading about are quite interesting.
It doesn't help that clinical trial databases cannot be public. Making
a fake database would take a lot of time.
The irony is , even with my deep understanding of data preparation in
clinical trials,
the pharmas still don't want to give me a job ( because I was gone for
many years).

********************************************************
Let's see if this post works : thanks to the folks who gave me advice
on how to properly respond to a post within a  thread . ( Although the
thread in my gmail account is only a subset of the posts visible in
the archives ). Crossing my fingers ....
