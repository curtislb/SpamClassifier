Try this script for loading speech-dispatcher.

It's not too well commented because I wrote it for me, and never
released.

#!/bin/sh
modprobe speakup_sftsyn
speech-dispatcher -d
speechd-up

cd /proc/speakup
echo "$1" > rate
echo "$2" > punc_level
echo "$3" > reading_punc
# exit

In edition to loading in my case, Speakup_sftsyn, how would I be sure that speechd-up and speech-dispatcher launched automatically? Otherwise I won't have speech on the Ubuntu server, should I choose to go with that. Let me know what you're suggestions are, please.
