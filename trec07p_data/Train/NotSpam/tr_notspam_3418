I think it would be even better to empower the users of these laptops
to make their own audiobooks.  Add recording and sharing functionality
to the e-book reader (and to the writing activity, so they can create
and share their own personal stories); leverage their enthusiasm,
their creativity, their numbers, and their sense of personal ownership.
When parents and older kids take pride in creating content that will
help younger kids learn to read, everybody benefits.

My parents read to me when I was little; let them read to each other,
not only read at by a distant stranger (or a speech synthesis algorithm).
