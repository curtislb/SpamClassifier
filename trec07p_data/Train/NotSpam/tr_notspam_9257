Yeah, I want to get all unique combinations of choosing ntest from ntotal.

for example, choosing 4000 training data from 10,000 total data.

Suppose they are sequenced as 1:10,000

One obvious combination is 1:4000

Then I run

sample ((1:1000), 4000)

it may output 4000 numbers:

1, 3, 5, .... 7999

Then I run again,

it may output another 4000 numbers:

2, 4, 6, ..., 8000

I know the number of such unique combinations is

Choose 4000 from 10,000

(I forgot how to denote this.)

Anyway, I remember choosing m from n is  computed as
T = n! /(m!(m-n)!)

! is factorial


My concern is:
when the sample output will start to repeat?

For example, maybe I run next time, the output will be the same as the first
time.
1,2, 3, ...., 4000
That's not what I want.

I hope to get T different or unique combinations in T runs. It is fine it
may start to repeat after T times.

I know the sample() may already do this way. But I am not sure.


Thank you!
