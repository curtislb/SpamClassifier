Featuring Lutts' Logic:

The Great National Temperance Beverage

Turkey and Gravy, Part 2

Feeling Better Now?

-----

Today I want to start with a look at Coca Cola, one of the world's most
respected companies.  What Coke sells is sugar and water, and flavoring,
but it does it so well - in the process making people all over the world
feel better - that we give them an A for achievement.

Interestingly, there's a Wikipedia page that lists all of Coke's slogans
over the years, and there, along with "The Pause That Refreshes" (1929)
and "Things Go Better With Coke" (1963) is "The Great National Temperance
Beverage" (1906).

For marketers, Coke is a model of success.  For investors, however, Coke
is stuck in the slow lane.  With $25 billion in revenues, it's too big to
grow fast; over the past decade its growth rate has averaged just 3% per
year.

And the stock?  It's underperformed the market since 1998!

If you want to get rich, you want to find the next Coke.

For a while it was Hansen Natural (HANS), the maker of natural juice
drinks, as well as Monster, Lost Energy and Rumba energy drinks.  The
stock was a top performer from 2003 until the middle of 2006; it gained
some 10,000%!  Even if you didn't get on board until May 2004, when the
stock first appeared in Cabot Top Ten Report, you could have earned
1,600%.

>From today's perspective, it's interesting to note that in the first two
years of the stock's run, the growth of the stock paralleled the growth of
earnings; in other words, the stock's action was "sensible."  But in the
final year of the advance, from September 2005 to July 2006, HANS actually
began to accelerate!  It was a well-known top performer by then, so people
were buying a winner.  They love to do that.  And skeptics were
increasingly beginning to question the sustainability of the company's
growth, so more and more short-sellers began to bet against the stock.

But as the stock continued to climb, short-sellers were forced to buy back
their shares of stock, and the resulting short squeeze pushed the stock
higher still!  Finally, in May 2006, the company announced that Anheuser
Busch would distribute Hansen's energy drinks through its giant network. 
The best news always comes at tops, and this news did the trick for
Hansen!

In August the bottom fell out, and the shares of the stock tumbled 26% in
one day.  The reason?  Revenues for the second quarter were up 83% to $156
million . . . and analysts had been expecting $157.3 million.

Ouch.

In the months that followed, investors learned that Hansen had backdated
stock option grants to certain key executives, too, and the sharks
circled, with lawyers filing class action suits against the company.  As I
write, the company has yet to file correct financial returns for the third
and fourth quarters of last year.

And the stock has performed no better than the market for the past nine
months.

I'm not recommending Hansen here.  I think it needs more time to recover
its equilibrium.  And I need to see an attractive chart before I even
consider recommending it.

But I write about it here because, like all history, it can teach you
lessons.  Or, to put it more elegantly, "History doesn't repeat itself,
but sometimes it rhymes."

Which brings us to Jones Soda (JSDA).

Simply, Jones may be the next Hansen.  Based in Seattle, Jones makes soda,
addressing the traditional carbonated drink market, the organic fruit
drink market and the energy drink market.

Jones has two big assets.  The first is founder and stem-winder Peter Van
Stolk, who's an ace marketer.  Thanks to him, and the creative people he
hires, Jones has been able to attract a wide following of people who want
an alternative beverage and are ready to pay a premium price.

For example, the labels on Jones Soda's bottles feature an ever-changing
gallery of photos that have been submitted by customers via the web site. 
There's no guarantee that the company will use your photo and, if they do,
the chance that you actually see it may be rather small . . . but it still
feels good to customers.  And if you really want to see your photo, you
can custom-order a twelve-pack of soda online adorned with a label
featuring your photo, for just $29.99, plus shipping and handling.

Furthermore, Jones makes you smile with its roster of creative flavors. 
I've listed them here before - nearly a month ago - so I won't do it
again; suffice to say that with flavors like Turkey and Gravy, Cranberry
and Mashed Potatoes, alongside "normal" flavors like Tangerine, Watermelon
and Twisted Lime, the company cultivates an image that younger customers,
in particular, identify with.

And Jones has just switched from corn syrup to cane sugar for sweetening,
saying it's healthier and it tastes better, and its customers deserve the
best.

Finally, the company - a la Starbucks - has launched Jones Independent
Music, which supports independent musicians and makes a buck, too.

The company's second big asset is its new distribution agreement with
National Beverage, announced back in September.  Under this agreement,
Jones sells concentrate to National Beverage, which makes the drinks in
greater volumes than previously possible, and distributes them through its
wide network.

This makes Jones a marketer and customer relations company (those are its
strengths) and leaves the grunt work to its partner.  And the results
appear extremely promising!

In the fourth quarter of last year, revenues grew 15% (the same pace as
the previous quarter) but earnings shot up 167% to $0.08 per share.  And
after-tax profit margins, previously 2.0%, exploded to 20.5%.

Fundamentally, we think the company has great potential.  Consider.

Coke has $24 billion in revenue
Hansen has $479 million.
Jones has $39 million.

Which one has the greatest growth potential?  Jones.

But buying this stock is going to be tricky.

When I wrote about Jones here on April 5, the stock was at 22, and I
suggested, because the stock had just run up from 14 and was 30% above its
25-day moving average, that it was rather extended.  I wrote, " . . .you
could buy a little now, but what you really want, to improve your
risk/reward relationship, is to buy on a pullback, ideally to the 25-day
moving average or even 50-day moving average."

But the pullback didn't come, and the stock ran all the way to 32 before
beginning its current well-deserved correction.  As I write, the stock has
fallen through its 25-day moving average at 24 and is heading toward its
50-day moving average at 20.  If the story appeals to you, I suggest you
wait until the current correction ends - it shouldn't be long - and then
buy between those two moving averages.

Switching gears, I now want to talk about a big pharmaceutical company
that you've all heard about.

But first a brief refresher.

What moves stocks?  Changes in perception.

What are the two kinds of companies where you're most likely to encounter
such changes in perception?

Small fast-growing companies, like Jones Soda.  And big old companies that
were once loved by everyone, but have fallen on such hard times that
investors have thrown away their shares in disgust.

Like Schering Plough (SGP).

Here's what editor Mike Cintolo wrote in Cabot Top Ten Report when the
stock popped up on Monday.

"Most of the stocks chosen by OptiMo for inclusion in Cabot Top Ten are
small companies, simply because it's easier to grow fast when you're
small.  Sometimes, though, a whole sector will turn strong, as we've seen
with steel stocks in recent months; in these cases we're not surprised to
see behemoths leaping ahead.  But when a loner like Schering Plough, with
$11 billion in sales, comes along, it piques our interest.  So what's
happening here?  Basically, after peaking at 61 in 1999 with a PE ratio of
42, and then falling to a low of 14 before losing $0.30 per share in 2004,
the company is on the rebound.  Bright spots include joint ventures in
cholesterol drugs, where sales totaled $1.2 billion in the March quarter,
up 48% from the before; arthritis treatment Remicade, which saw sales rise
37% to $373 million in the quarter; antihistamine Nasonex, which saw sales
grow 24% to $284 million; and allergy medication Clarinex, which saw
growth of 28% to $204 million.  Also bright: the ongoing acquisition of
Netherlands-based Organon, and NOXAFIL, a new therapy for preventing
deadly fungal infections.  Last Thursday's earnings results, which easily
eclipsed analysts' projections, suggest there's an under-appreciated
growth wave going on here. "

What I see when I look at Schering Plough is a company that used to be
golden, right up there with Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline and Merck.   
Investors loved those stocks!  But when the bull market of the 1990s
ended, all those big pharmaceutical stocks suffered, and investors who had
fallen in love with stocks on the way up ended up selling in disgust on
the way down.

Today, however, as explained above, business is turning around (not just
at Schering Plough but at most of the other big pharmaceutical companies,
too), earnings are on the rise again, and the stocks are generally strong.
 But Schering Plough is the strongest of the entire sector, the only one
with the performance that earned it a spot in Cabot Top Ten.

Now, you could try to compare all these big old pharmaceutical companies
by examining their product lines, their development pipelines, their
projected growth rates and more.  Or you can just trust the stocks
themselves, recognizing that the stocks reflect the combined judgments of
all investors with knowledge and opinions of those stocks.  It's not only
quicker; it's a lot more productive.

In Monday's issue of Cabot Top Ten Report, we recommended buying SGP
between 30 and 32, and as I write, the stock is still in that range.

Editor's Note

Schering Plough's first appearance in a Cabot product came on April 2,
when it appeared in Cabot Top Ten Report.  That's our weekly publication
that focuses on finding the market's strongest stocks, and then analyzing
why they're so strong.  Many times they're smaller companies, but
sometimes they're big old companies coming out of the basement.   If
you're looking for more hot stocks like this, I suggest you give it a try,
with a no-risk trial subscription, and be among the first to read about
the market's next great growth stories.  It's your first step to finding
the next Ultra Petroleum, the Next Hansen Natural and the next Intuitive
Surgical.  To get started, simply click the link below.
