You have to use the & sign to put Orca in the background. Then hit backspace 
to hopefully get the beep that you're still in the terminal. Then you just 
put in Ubiquity without the speech and speech will come up for install. This 
odd way has to do with the fact that Orca can't communicate across accounts 
so it needs to be running as root, as would the installer be.
