I've been updating debian regularly to stay ahead of security problems. 
Earlier I had figured out that putting an entry like: http://url /url-name 
would make a directory of url-name under the date directory and put 
podcasts inside the url-name directory.  Well until a couple days ago that 
was working well.  By now, subscription entries that had been working 
perfectly well before show up as downloads but this time the podcasts 
themselves are being saved as single files with the names chosen as 
url-name before.  For this to have happened, probably some pretty 
considerable changes were done recently in python recently since podracer 
hasn't had an update for debian lately.
