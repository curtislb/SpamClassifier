It appears as though this HTML snippet resides in a Perl script, so it
looks out of context. You may want to copy in some of your code for
context. Are you using any CGI module? To print this HTML from within a
script, you'll need to do something like this:

print <<EOF;

> <HTML>
> <HEAD></HEAD>
> <BODY>
> <FORM  METHOD="post" ENCTYPE='multipart/form-data'>
> Photo to Upload: <INPUT TYPE="file" NAME="photo">
> <br>
> Your Email Address: <INPUT TYPE="text" NAME="email_address">
> <br><br>
> <INPUT TYPE="submit" NAME="Submit" VALUE="Submit Form">
> </FORM>
> </BODY>
> </HTML>

EOF

...otherwise, it all will appear to be barewords that make no sense.
