						<b>Gaza</b>
<br>

<br>
Who is in control in Gaza, and who can resolve the crisis between Hamas and=
 Fatah which is making the lives or ordinary Palestinians a nightmare? Hama=
s has seized the Gaza strip after a week of factional fighting between the =
rival groups which resulted in dreadful bloodshed.=20
<br>

<br>
The Palestinian President Mahmood Abbas has declared a state of emergency i=
n Gaza and has appointed a new interim Prime Minister, Salam Fayyed, an Ind=
ependent and a former World Bank official. But this move could be described=
 as "firefighting". Is there any chance of a lasting peace?  Is another uni=
ty government out of the question and with our Foreign Secretary Margaret B=
eckett describing the violence in Gaza as "a coup" does the international c=
ommunity have a role to play in conflict resolution?
<br>

<br>
<b>Football bungs</b>
<br>
=20
<br>
The football world is in meltdown after Lord Stevens' Inquiry into "footbal=
l bungs" has reported that five Premier League have breached transfer regul=
ations. The clubs are Chelsea, Newcastle, Bolton, Middlesborough and Portsm=
outh. The former Metropolitan Police commissioner has also expressed concer=
n about 15 agents and third parties involved in the 17 transfers.=20
<br>

<br>
Now it's the Football Association's job to take these investigations furthe=
r. Tonight we'll be examining Lord Stevens' report and asking whether the p=
rotestations of innocence by the Association of Football Agents are credibl=
e.=20
<br>
=20
<br>
<b>EU summit</b>=20
<br>

<br>
If Tony Blair was looking to next week's European summit to provide a gala =
end to his time as Prime minister Angela Markel's billet doux to the member=
 states encouraging them to approve a European constitution in all but name=
 - add to that Poland's anger about the country's voting power within the U=
nion - and next week's summit looks like being a rancorous affair.=20
<br>

<br>
The idea of a "charter of fundamental rights" is an anathema to the Labour =
government so what will Tony Blair do next week? Our Europe editor Mark Mar=
dell gives us the inside track.
<br>

<br>
<b>Local government</b>
<br>
=20
<br>
And radicalism is alive and well in the home of the Magna Carta - the peopl=
e of Bury St Edmunds were so fed up with their local government, they voted=
 to abolish it. Steve Smith has been watching anarchy in action - on the da=
y that Michael Heseltine launched his new blueprint (same as his old bluepr=
int?) for reviving local government - directly elected mayors with "very su=
bstantial powers".  What would the people of Bury St Edmunds make of that?=
=20

<br>
Join me at 10.30 on BBC2.

						PRESENTED BY MARTHA KEARNEY
					</DIV>
=09=09=09=09=09
					On Review tonight, with my guests Rosie Boycott, Mark Kermode, Ian Ran=
kin and Andrew Roberts, we will be discussing the new Turner exhibition of =
watercolours at Tate Britain.=20
<br>

<br>
<B>HOCKNEY ON TURNER</B>
<br>

<br>
Part of the show has been curated by David Hockney who took me on a tour of=
 his choices and his own paintings of an East Yorkshire wood which are also=
 on show.  He was so charming and insightful that I came back in a glow tel=
ling Review producers that I would like to marry him. There are minor obsta=
cles like the fact he is gay, turns 70 next month and I am already married.
<br>

<br>
<B>LA VIE EN ROSE</B>
<br>

<br>
Perhaps I should move on. We will also review a new film about the legendar=
y French chanteuse and national icon Edith Piaf whose anthem Non Je Ne Regr=
ette Rien must have had as many plays on Desert Island Discs as My Way.
<br>
=20
<br>
Now the extraordinary events of her life have been turned into a biopic wri=
tten and directed by Oliver Dahan tracing her early beginning raised as a s=
ickly child in a brothel, her discovery on the streets of Paris, to her fam=
e and morphine and heroin addiction and a crippling death from arthritis an=
d cancer at the age of 47 in 1963. In France the film was called La Mome - =
the kid - Piaf's nickname.=20
<br>

<br>
<B>THE DIANA CHRONICLES</B>
<br>

<br>
My guests will also be discussing Tina Brown's new book The Diana Chronicle=
s published to mark the 10th anniversary of her death. She has had access t=
o Diana's close circle, Tony Blair and all sorts of contacts but is there a=
nything to add to a life which has been so trawled over?=20
<br>

<br>
Watching the archive we are using brought back some memories for me. I live=
d round the corner from Coleherne Court in the 1980s and remember the crowd=
s of paparazzi outside the entrance to her flat. I was also working just of=
f Fleet Street on the day of her wedding. Even the most hardened hacks came=
 out of the newsroom to see the royal carriage on its return from St Paul's=
. The new Princess looked beautiful but was quivering like a young deer. Oh=
 dear, I have come over all 1950s Royal reporter - so sorry.
<br>
=20
<br>
<B>JEKYLL</B>
<br>

<br>
A return to baser instincts with Jekyll, a new BBC One series starring Jame=
s Nesbitt. It's a retelling of the 1886 Robert Louis Stevenson classic abou=
t good and evil and the duality of man's nature. This is a very contemporar=
y retelling in a six part series also starring Meera Syal.=20=20
<br>
=20
<br>
I hope you can join us all at 11.=20
