Parrot::Configure::runstep() is the only subroutine in  
Parrot::Configure() that is still not covered via the tests in t/ 
configure/ or t/postconfigure/.  No test has yet been written in part  
because this is a subroutine which is not really well positioned in  
its current package.  Everything else in Parrot::Configure has to do  
with initial configuration; runstep() has to do with *re-running* a  
step after Configure.pl has already completed.  It's a tool that some  
Parrot developers use (Patrick Michaud has spoken up for it), but is  
not used by make.

Additional problem:  Parrot::Configure also has subroutines named  
runstep() and _runstep().  Ideally, any refactoring would include  
less confusing names.

Because runstep() runs after Configure.pl, any tests for it should go  
into the t/postconfigure/ directory.

So the task is to write unit tests for Parrot::Configure::runstep()  
and, if appropriate, to refactor it, with that refactoring possibly  
including renaming and/or relocating the subroutine.
