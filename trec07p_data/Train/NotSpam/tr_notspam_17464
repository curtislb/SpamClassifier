Hi Michael, you definitely need to run the editor as root to get 
read/write access to the file.  I'm not sure, but you may need to 
specify an absolute path with sudo.  Instead of using sudo, however, it 
is often more convenient to switch the current user using the su command 
or loging in as root on another console.

Best regards, Tomas.
