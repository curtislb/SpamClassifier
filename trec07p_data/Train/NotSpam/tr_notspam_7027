But if the people had any respect for the law they would obey it. So 
many millions of people using p2p to acquire unauthorized works can't 
all be wrong.

In my community it is illegal to throw out recyclables. Trash gets 
picked up every week but recyclables only every other. It would be a lot 
easier to toss the recyclables and the risk of getting caught is 
practically nil, yet just about everyone recycles. Why? Because they 
agree with the law.

So yes, I agree they think the risk of getting caught is low, but they 
would not even be taking that risk if they thought they were wrong to do 
it in the forst place.

Also, I still think your definition of "political" is too narrow. With 
companies gaining greater and greater control of so much social policy 
in the world, it is very important to recognize actions that influence 
corporate policy are just as political as ones affecting government policy.
