The difference is in the cost of defending against such an action; in
the normal case you have the ability to make the entire claim go away
by notifying the court that the venue is improper. In the case of a
choice of venue clause, you first have to invalidate the choice of
venue, which increases the cost.

If you're going to ignore the court case, it doesn't matter to you,
but if you ever plan on travelling to germany or doing business with
people in germany (or live in some part of germany that isn't close
enough to berlin to defend yourself there) it can be a significant
cost.

Unlike the GPL, the CDDL doesn't separate use from modification. Since
use (or at least performance of a work) is a right that is reserved to
the copyright holder, you need some level of permission to do so.

No, I'm saying that people who disagree should engage my analysis
instead of remaining silent or discarding them with offhand comments.

If I had time to do so, I'd consider it. Since I don't, I content
myself with trying to make sure my messages approach this standard,
setting an example instead.

I'd like to believe it includes every rational being.

Almost all this happens on -legal, actually. Some of it happens more
frequently on other lists, since drafting licenses is not something
that -legal does, but many of the contributors to -legal are involved
in making sure that new versions of licences that are drafted are
obviously DFSG Free.

I've personally been involved in trying to resolve the GFDL issue,
making sure that the GPLv3 is DFSG free, and have been working along
with Simon and a few others to try to fix the RFC issue. [In the case
of the CDDL, it's interesting to note that this very issue was
supposedly going to be fixed or at least looked at in an upcomming
revision of the CDDL.]

If it's the case that a signficant proportion of contributors to
-legal and Debian Developers feel that an improper decision has been
made, there's little else that can be done besides bringing it to a
GR.

The problem is that it's very difficult to know if the consensus
differens from the "silent majority" because the "silent majority" is
nearly silent.

All of these, save the latter are subject to being overruled by GR;
they are not necessarily the official position of Debian, but general
consensus, or the consensus of ftpmaster. Even though ftpmaster is
likely in a priveledged position if they are currently delegated by
the DPL to make such determinations, they still should be careful in
advocating their opinion as the official position of Debian.

Indeed; I wasn't aware of the CDDL ever being accepted in main; had I
paid more attention to it, I would have brought this issue up sooner.

Why not? It's not like it's impossible to hold convictions and still
make decisions under a separate set. I can't imagine that there will
ever be someone who is versed enough in an area who will agree with
all of the decisions made by other people. What you appear to be
asking for is "yes men" which pretty much obviates anyone with
publicly expressed convictions.

It's not like I'm personally campaigning for the ability to make these
decisions myself, and -legal hasn't ever been in a position to make
them either. When -legal (or I, for that matter) say that something is
DFSG Free, it tends to be non-controversially so. The converse is
where the issue lies.

It's interesting that you see this message this way; to me it seems
that he's getting at precisely what you appear to want. -legal in
general felt that GFDL had serious issues, and under no circumstances
could it be acceptable for main. When the GR decision was made,
figuring how how to reconcile the previous stance with the outcome of
the GR was something that had to be determined. The use of hyperbole
is in bad taste, but skipping over such things is required to avoid
devolving into meaningless flamewars.
