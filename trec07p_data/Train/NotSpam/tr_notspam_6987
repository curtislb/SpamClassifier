All is well Asheesh, since you'll be starting at CC in July...no more
escaping me then! :)

To others, I'm working on five projects now to try and get a massive
open free repository that is third-party controlled (not Creative
Commons), in the interest of open content and building the community.

1. Spread Free Culture is about collecting media of, around and about
free culture, including video, interviews, posters, etc, which others
might use in evangelism, etc.

2.) Spread Open Media is a project that xiph.org is working to launch.
I'm helping with a logo contest for that project
http://openclipart.org/xiph That project intends to be a massive
repository for open media (xiph formats, svg, etc).

3.) http://opencontentlibrary.org/ is a project to try and document this
type of content based collection/library. The main two projects I've
helped seed are part of this, and it should be noted that these are not
just remix communities, but communities focused around specific content,
with the idea to encourage other more generalized libraries for other
media: video, 3d models, text, etc

4.) http://openclipart.org is still going strong

5.) http://openfontlibrary.org is live and kicking, and now with a logo!


On this, note, I would be more than happy to help advise and/or seed an
open video-type project if others would like to get on board with
this...ccHost is a great piece of software which alleviates the pain of
a content management system, is extensible and is developed actively by
Creative Commons and others in the community.

Yes, I'd like to rev these projects back up...sustainability is key for
Spread Free Culture and Spread Open Media

However, i think that something like an open video collection would be a
brilliant addition to the arsenal of opencontentlibrary.org projects,
and something I would help support from within and out CC.
