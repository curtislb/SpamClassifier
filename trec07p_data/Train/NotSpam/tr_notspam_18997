   Any chance you could contact her?  Prior to the government tabling a 
bill implementing anti-circumvention it may be possible for the Senate 
to launch a study into the effectiveness and issues surrounding such 
legislation.

   If we can just get the 4-owners relevant to anti-circumvention onto 
parliament's radar, then we may have a chance.  Out of the 4 relevant 
owners (copyright holder, owner of media, software author, owner of 
hardware), anti-circumvention only alleges (unproven) to help the 
interests of a small subset of copyright holders while greatly harming 
the interests of the other 3 groups (as well as some copyright holders).
