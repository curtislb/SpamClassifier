Having downloaded and installed the most current iso, all of the kernels 
are now 2.6.18 versions (very good from security perspective)!  What is 
the bigmem kernel used for as opposed to the i686 kernel?  Also, I think I 
found me a better firewall program available in both debian and slackware 
and maybe elsewhere too.  It's more involved getting set up than lockkit 
and can be adjusted using speakup.  The package is called 
arno-iptables-firewall.
