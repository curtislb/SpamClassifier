The problem is the certain people have developed certain demeanors on 
the Perl usenet newsgroups. Now whenever these people post to the Perl 
newsgroup perl.beginners, their posts will be reflected here on 
beginners[at]perl.org.

These people will never change, and I killfiled them a long time ago, 
but they will still change the character of this mailing list, and that 
I don't want.

There are two problems with asking them to leave:

1) They won't leave.

2) Where do they go? They've been posting to the perl.beginners 
newsgroup for ages, and when they post to that newsgroup, they should 
have no expectation that they messages will be reflected to our mailing 
list.

The problem is a gross misconfiguration somewhere that needs to be fixed 
ASAP. I hope that Google is not involved. Google has been doing to 
pretty weird things lately with mailing lists and moderators[at]isc.org 
(which presumably facilitates posting to moderated newsgroups).

I understand that Google has a big presence on usenet, but I hope that 
they haven't used that power to arbitrarily affect a major change to the 
structures of usenet and the mailing lists.
