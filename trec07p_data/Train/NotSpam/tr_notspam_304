Neither; it does two-stage least-squares (2SLS).

I'm not sure what you mean by goodness of fit. If you have in mind an
R^2-like measure; you can always use 1 -
error-variance/variance-of-endogenous-variable, but this is not guaranteed
to be positive.

Since there's no likelihood for 2SLS estimation, I don't see how you could
get an AIC. On the other hand, sem() fits by full-information
maximum-likelihood (FIML). It prints out the BIC; you could compute the AIC
if you liked.
