Yes, this is why MO integration is the next milestone in pugs.
The parrot folks are also heavily at work in the meta-object area.

Probably something shorter.  The problem with "lines" is that they aren't
necessarily lines.  But "records" is so 1960s...  Also, anything that
names the units could be seen as the count of those units in the file as
a whole rather that the number read up till now.

Tempted to have $io.sofar or some such...

There's a prototype synopsis on variables out in pugs/docs/AES but it's
still pretty rudimentary.

As for $. itself as a variable, it's dead.  Its "twigil" has been stolen
by $.foo for object attributes, and we're trying not to reuse twigils
for bare variable names, though it comes to mind that we have both $! and
$!foo currently.  But there are very, very few punctuational variables
in Perl 6 compared to Perl 5.  Most of 'em are just gone.
