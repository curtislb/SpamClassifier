I don't know if this conversation is supposed to happen elsewhere, or 
perhaps with a smaller CC list, but:

This is non-free :-( But they shouldn't be concerned about people 
selling it standalone; the customers will soon realise they've been 
duped, and bang goes that business relationship.

This second sentence, while not non-free, should not be part of the 
license terms, as it is not related to the license.

This leaves open the question "If I don't attribute the data to EPSG, 
can I modify it in ways other than stated in this licence?". This is 
ambiguous. What does "preferably" mean, legally? Do I have to or don't I?

I suggest reframing 4 and 5 something like this:

4. You may copy, modify and/or distribute this data for any purpose. 
Modified data sets may not be attributed to EPSG unless parameter values 
are only modified as described in OGP Surveying and Positioning Guidance 
Note 7-1 annex G, and numeric equivalence is achieved. Numeric 
equivalence refers to the results of geodetic calculations in which the 
parameters are used, for example (i) conversion of ellipsoid defining 
parameters, or (ii) conversion of parameters between one and two 
standard parallel projection methods, or (iii) conversion of parameters 
between 7-parameter geocentric transformation methods.
