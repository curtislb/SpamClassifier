Freshly Exhumed writes "For website publishers, a poor web rating can be
disastrous. Bad television ratings mean television shows get canceled,
bad web ratings mean websites go out of business. For advertisers,
accurate web ratings are critical to optimize spending. Inaccurate
ratings data means advertisers will overspend on poorly performing sites
or not advertise on smaller sites whose numbers are really much higher
than reported. In the case of Canadian web site [0]Digital Home, already
hit with an [1]advertising boycott by Bell Canada over the site's
pro-consumer editorial content, the site's owner is now in danger of
ending operations, apparently due to the inaccuracies of [2]ComScore
rankings. For example, Google Analytics reported Digital Home served up
over 2.7 million page views in January to almost 250,000 unique visitors.
A web buyer at one of Canada's largest advertising agencies confirmed
that ComScore reported just 32,000 visitors. Added to this is ComScore's
[3]secretly-installed spyware troubles."

[0]Rick Zeman sends us to the Washington Post, which is reporting that a
John Doe lawsuit will be filed in US District Court today in
spam-unfriendly Alexandria, Virginia. The suit will be filed by Project
Honey Pot, which is having [1]a week of big announcements. The suit seeks
the identity of individuals responsible for harvesting millions of e-mail
addresses on behalf of spammers. From the Post: "The company is filing
the suit on behalf of some 20,000 people who use its anti-spam tool. Web
site owners use the project's free software to generate pages that
feature unique 'spam trap' e-mail addresses each time those pages are
visited. The software then records the Internet address of the visitor
and the date and time of the visit. Because those addresses are never
used to sign up for e-mail lists, the software can help investigators
draw connections between harvesters and spammers if an address generated
by a spam trap or 'honey pot' later receives junk e-mail."

having a "closing down" sale... All stock has been slashed, save $$$, why

a recent InformationWeek survey indicating that [2]30% of business have
no intention of moving to Vista, ever.

Sandia Labs has announced a new milestone in Linear Transformer Driver
technology that aims to [0]solve one of the biggest obstacles to
practical fusion reactors. Getting the current needed to "spark" a burst
of fusion is doable; getting a constant series of sparks going to create
a continuous chain of fusion bursts has never been achieved. The LTD,
which allows the Sandia Z machine to fire once every 10.2 seconds, makes
it look achievable. The press release (which has been picked up in a few
places, but with no further analysis) says that practical fusion power
could now be 20 years off.

GoIBMPS3 writes "Soon the powerful 'Cell' microprocessor that fuels
Sony's PlayStation 3 console [0]will be available in IBM mainframe
computers. The intent is to allow high-performance machines to run
complex online games and virtual worlds. 'The integration initially will
be accomplished by networking the mainframe with IBM's Cell blades, but
eventually the Cells will be plugged more directly into the mainframes
via PCI adapter cards, IBM said. It's the latest twist in IBM's
years-long effort to keep mainframes not only relevant but also
cutting-edge. IBM is touting the partnership as an example of hybrid
computing--a trend sweeping the high-performance computing industry as
companies augment general-purpose servers with special-purpose chips that
to accelerate particular tasks.'"

Computer offers advice to IT managers about how to integrate Apple
systems into the existing IT infrastructure, and offers hints from
leading Mac OS X experts on configuring those systems once they've
arrived. '[A] key element in corporate Macintosh adoption is the
importance of third-party software and custom solutions. They can help
smooth the way for integrating Macs onto the network. While specialists
say they wish third-party support were greater, the openness of the Mac

well-worn path that draws and then traps your IT staff into familiar

MosiMosi wrote to let us know about a new development on the Internet2
front. Researchers in Tokyo have advanced the speed of the network,
[0]breaking records twice in two days back in December of last year. "On
Dec. 30 [researchers] sent data at 7.67 gigabits per second, using
standard communications protocols. The next day, using modified
protocols, the team broke the record again by sending data over the same
20,000-mile path at 9.08 Gbps. That likely represents the current
network's final record because rules require a 10 percent improvement for
recognition, a percentage that would bring the next record right at the
Internet2's current theoretical limit of 10 Gbps."

[0]Billosaur writes "A judge has ordered the University of
Wisconsin-Madison to turn over the names and contact information for the
53 UW-M students [1]accused of file sharing over the university's
networks by the RIAA. 'U.S. District Judge John Shabaz signed an order
requiring UW-Madison to relinquish the names, addresses, telephone
numbers, e-mail addresses and Media Access Control addresses for each of
the 53 individuals.' The ruling came as no surprise to the university,
which had previously rejected the request of the RIAA to hand out their
settlement letters to alleged copyright violators on their campus. The
school feels the RIAA will have a hard time tracking down who did the
file-sharing anyway, as the IP addresses the RIAA has for the violations
may be mapped to computers in common areas, making it difficult to
determine just which people may have made the downloads."

Flash hard drive. The only hitch comes with the price tag, which is set
at a rather expensive price of $549. This will definitely ensure the
laptop is set for a very high-profile consumer. 'The 1.8-inch 32GB
SanDisk SSD, which SanDisk announced in January, increases performance by
as much as 23 percent and is three and a half times less likely to fail
when compared with HDDs currently available for the Latitude line, Dell
said. The drive, currently available in North and South America, costs
$549 -- on par with the 32GB drive Sony is offering exclusively in Japan
for the Type-G Vaio. SanDisk will expand SSD availability to Europe and

magnamous asks: "Ever since Senator Ted Stevens used the phrase 'series
of tubes' to describe his understanding of the Internet, I've noticed
[0]several stories and comments referencing how silly that is. Although I
agree that that description is rather silly, each time I've found myself
trying to come up with a -succinct layman's definition- of what the
Internet is, and I come up short. Wikipedia has a [1]gargantuan page
describing the Internet, and [2]Google's definitions offer pretty good
descriptions of what the Internet is in a functional sense (with some
throwing in terms that the layman wouldn't understand, or take the time
to understand), but not really a good description of what it -is- in the
physical sense that I think Sen. Stevens was trying to get at. What are
your suggestions for a succinct layman's definition of the Internet?"
