This is documented somewhere already.  Pugs does not implement the  
spec as documented, though.

File tests are supposed to return something which:
- behaves as a Bool
- stringifies as a filename
- numifies as a file size or as a time, if appropriate
- propagates a stat object (obviating perl5's magic _)

Current Pugs only does the first three, sort of:  the size and time  
operators return numeric, the others string, all behave appropriately  
if used as booleans.  This means you mostly get the expected results  
for chained tests, at the price of every operator doing its own stat().

My impression is that junction types aren't really "there" yet, so  
this is the best that can currently be done.
