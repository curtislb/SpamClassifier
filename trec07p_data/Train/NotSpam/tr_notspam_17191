As I wrote in another thread on this list recently, It should work if 
you use Speech Dispatcher both with Orca and Speakup.  Speech Dispatcher 
will handle speech from both clients for you.  Problems may arise when 
you try to use one synthesizer through two different speech systems 
(Speech Dispatcher and Gnome Speech).
