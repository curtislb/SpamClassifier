They refer to the concept of property which is *exclusively* owned and
controlled, such that a single entity is able to market and sell it.

Software whose use, modification, selling, or distribution is
controlled exclusively by a single party, generally by restricting
access to the source code and/or restrictive licencing agreements.

Well, that's the root of our contention then. As proprietary software
does not encompass the entire set of non-free software, you should not
use the terms interchangeably.
