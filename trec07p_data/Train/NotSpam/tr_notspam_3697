Hello sm1lies,

This is your last day to register for the Apollo Reporting System and Credit Analysis Tool assembly contests, with a combined prize pool of $36,000! With a two week submission period, recommended team sizes of between 2 and 4 members, these two applications are an excellent opportunity to get involved in producing top-quality software. 

About Credit Analysis Tool:
The application is a web-based .NET application and is critical to improving controls and efficiency within a leading energy services company. The Credit Analysis Tool will provide an easy-to-use application that provides a simple workflow component to the credit request and approval process. 

About Apollo Reporting System:
The Reporting System replaces a manual process whereby customers place an order for 1 or more reports, which are then written and reviewed by several internal departments before being published and/or delivered to the customer. TopCoder is helping automate this entire process with the Reporting System, which is both a web-based management interface for report order tracking and for the back-end processor.

Good luck!

- The TopCoder Software Team
