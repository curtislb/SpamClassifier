   I sent my own MP (and my MP from before I moved a few years ago, who 
I will be meeting with in person next week) a letter.  I sent a similar 
letter (almost identical wording, but as separate letters) to each of 
the 10 MPs that spoke during that "debate".


   I recommend that everyone else also write their members of parliament 
(and the 10 who participated in the debate) as well.  This "debate" may 
be the shape of things to come, with the possibility that the discussion 
of anti-circumvention legislation (the complete abogation of protecting 
the rights of software authors and hardware owners in order to 
theoretically protect the outdated business models of a tiny subset of 
the content industry) being as poor.

My summary of the debate -- the end contains links to the ridings of the 
10 MPs who spoke, and thus links to contact information.

My letter to MPs

Darryl Moore,

   I'm curious if you would be willing to author a short sample letter 
that people can send to introduce MPs to the DVD that you sent.  I'm 
thinking of something similar to what I wrote for the GOSLING package.

Here are all the other sample letters we've created thus far:
