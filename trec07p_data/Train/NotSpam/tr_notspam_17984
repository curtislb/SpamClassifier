Antiquities Trial Fixes on Collectors? Role
By ELISABETTA POVOLEDO

ROME, June 8 ? It was a ?sophisticated method of laundering,? a prosecution
witness testified on Friday in a trial courtroom here. Private collectors
would acquire looted artifacts and eventually donate them to museums, she
said.

The witness, Daniela Rizzo, an Italian archaeologist, specifically cited the
owners of four American antiquities collections.

None are on trial here. None have been legally charged with any wrongdoing.
Nor do Italian prosecutors contend that the collectors had evidence that
certain objects had been looted. Yet the prosecutors have clearly adopted a
strategy of calling attention to collectors, especially well-heeled
Americans, with the implicit message that every player in the global
antiquities trade is within their sights.

The actual trial defendants are Marion True, a former antiquities curator at
the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, and Robert Hecht, an American
dealer in classical artifacts. Both are charged with trafficking in objects
that were illicitly excavated from Italian soil.

Dozens of witnesses have filed through the courtroom since the trial opened
in November 2005, but only this month did prosecutors fully turn their
sights on American antiquities collectors in court testimony. The tactic has
infuriated defense lawyers, whose objections became so heated on Friday that
Judge Gustavo Barbalinardo decided to suspend the proceedings until tempers
cooled. 

In her testimony Ms. Rizzo said that the ?very rich? private collectors
built collections that ?included objects that were undoubtedly looted from
Italy.? 

She cited the Texas oilmen Nelson Bunker Hunt and William Herbert Hunt (who
sold their artifacts at auction in 1990 after their fortunes collapsed); the
New York diamond merchant Maurice Tempelsman; the art philanthropist
Lawrence Fleischman and his wife, Barbara; and the financier Leon Levy and
his wife, Shelby White.

Objects from their collections went on display in major exhibitions,
?becoming known to the public and the scientific world, after which they
ended up in museums,? Ms. Rizzo said. ?It was a different, more
sophisticated method of laundering artifacts.?

Defense lawyers for Ms. True and Mr. Hecht repeatedly interrupted Ms.
Rizzo?s testimony; Francesco Isolabella, a lawyer for Ms. True, objected
that it was beyond Ms. Rizzo?s mandate to ?come up with inductive or
deductive theories.? Mr. Isolabella said that the archaeologist was making
?evaluations that only a prosecutor can make.?

?She should stick to identifying Etruscan vases,? Mr. Isolabella said.

Because they are not on trial, none of the collectors are represented in the
courtroom. Contacted through their offices, Nelson Bunker Hunt and Mr.
Tempelsman declined to comment on the trial or to be interviewed. Through a
spokesman, Ms. White declined to comment on the trial. (Her husband died in
2003.) In a telephone interview from New York, Ms. Fleischman said: ?It
seems like anyone can accuse anyone of anything without any proof. We
collected for the pure joy of the object.? She declined to comment further
on the trial. But she said that she and her husband, who died in 1997, never
suspected that they might be buying anything less than legitimate.

Ms. Fleishman, a former Getty trustee, and her husband donated or sold more
than 300 antiquities to the Getty. Italy?s Culture Ministry is demanding
that the museum return a dozen of the Fleischman objects.

It seems inevitable that as prosecutors began investigating the passage of
objects from looted tombs in the Italian countryside to American
institutions, they would become interested in private donors, long the
lifeblood of the world?s museums.

A report this year by the Association of Art Museum Directors, which
represents nearly 200 museums in the United States, Canada and Mexico, notes
that ?more than 90 percent of the art collections held in public trust by
American?s art museums were donated by private individuals.?

Beyond altruism, the economic benefit for collectors in the United States is
a tax deduction equal to the current market value of the object. This
deduction can save the donor 25 to 50 percent of the object?s value,
depending on what method is used. In return, museums short of funds can
aspire to top-rate works of art.

?There?s every reason to think that a museum would bring an item it can?t
afford to the attention of a collector, hoping for a donation,? said Patty
Gerstenblith, a law professor at DePaul University and president of the
Lawyers? Committee for Cultural Heritage Preservation.

At the same time, she said, ?it helps to distance the museum from a
questionable piece.? There is less risk of public disapproval should a
museum be forced to return a piece that arrived as a donation, she said.

For at least the past decade, though, Peter C. Marzio, director of the
Museum of Fine Arts in Houston and a past president of the Association of
Art Museum Directors, said, both collectors and museums have been conducting
?diligent provenance inquiries? on artifacts that change hands.

He cited an auction on Thursday at Sotheby?s in New York where a
2,000-year-old bronze statue of Artemis sold for $28.6 million, a world
record for sculpture and for an antiquity.

?Provenance is what is driving prices up,? Mr. Marzio said. ?Provenance is
having enormous value.? The Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo acquired
the Artemis from a Manhattan dealer in 1953, well before the adoption of a
1970 Unesco convention governing traffic in cultural property.

During a courtroom break, Mr. Hecht, the dealer on trial here, scoffed at
the notion of a collector like Ms. White having an economic incentive for
donating to a museum. ?The last thing Shelby Levy White needs is a tax
deduction,? Mr. Hecht said. She ?really liked and learned about every piece
she bought.? 

Running parallel to the trial is the Italian Culture Ministry?s dogged
effort to lay claim to what it contends are looted objects in American
museums. Last year it negotiated the return of 21 antiquities from the
Metropolitan Museum of Art and 13 from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.

Talks with the Getty have faltered. Italy is seeking the return of 52
objects over all from that museum, among them a dozen donated by Ms.
Fleischman. So far the Getty has agreed to return 26 artifacts to Italy,
including 5 acquired from the Fleischmans and three pieces purchased from
Mr. Tempelsman.

In an interview Paolo Ferri, the trial prosecutor, asserted that American
collectors might one day find themselves at the defense table.

Once a verdict is delivered in the trial of Ms. True and Mr. Hecht, he said,
?I?ll draw my conclusions.?

Faking it

The recent revelation that Bolton Museum's Amarna Princess statue is a fake
manufactured in 2003 rather than an ancient Egyptian piece has focused
attention on the perennial problem of forgeries. Tom Flynn investigates the
world of dodgy deals and counterfeit creations.

Fakes have been described as "the venereal disease of the illicit art
market" and it is an apt metaphor. As prices in the art market rise
exponentially, so the risk of contamination by counterfeit objects increases
accordingly. Reputations are at stake, but so are significant amounts of
money as fakers and forgers become more sophisticated in their methods.?

The Amarna Princess, which was acquired with Art Fund help in 2003 as an
ancient Egyptian representation of a daughter of Pharaoh Akhenaten (reigned
1379-1362 BC) has left a trail of red faces from Bolton to Bloomsbury and so
it is hardly surprising that on making a few gentle enquiries for this
article lips remained as tightly sealed as a pharaoh's tomb. Then, in late
April this year, 84-year-old George Greenhalgh of Bromley Cross, Bolton, and
four members of his family, were charged with conspiracy defraud in relation
to the statue. They are due to appear in court on 24 July.

Suspicions about the Amarna Princess first arose in early 2006 when a
relief, purporting to be Assyrian, was submitted to the British Museum for
expert opinion. When it emerged that the relief had come from the Greenhalgh
family ? the same source as the Amarna Princess ? Scotland Yard was called
in. Now it seems the alabaster torso could be one of any number of fake
objects allegedly produced by the same highly skilled team of fakers and
forgers between 1989 and 2003.

Dick Ellis, director of the specialist art consultancy The Art Management
Group, is a former Head of Scotland Yard's Art & Antiques Unit and a
world-renowned expert on art crime, fakes and forgeries. In the early 1990s,
Ellis recalls that paintings purporting to be by the Scottish Colourist S.J.
Peploe began circulating in the art trade. Alarm bells rang when the paint
fell off.? The pictures were traced to a family in Bolton. According to
Ellis, Scotland Yard could have made an arrest at the time but failed to do
so due to organisational constraints. The consequences of that inaction are
now becoming clear.?

Some years after the Peploe incident, Ellis was invited to the office of Dr
Robert Anderson, director of the British Museum. Dr Anderson and his
colleagues had begun nurturing some doubts about a large Romano-British
silver tray ? the so-called Risley Park Lanx ? which had appeared at
Sotheby's in 1991 and was acquired by the museum shortly after for around
?100,000.?

The Risley Park Lanx was discovered at Risley Park, Derbyshire in 1729 and
published by William Stukeley in 1736, but subsequently vanished. When it
reappeared in the 1990s it was supported by a provenance document purporting
to be a will,? bequeathing the lanx to ? you guessed it ? a member of the
same Bolton-based family responsible for the peeling Peploes. What
complicated matters, however, was the fact that the lanx had tested positive
as Roman silver. Had the family recast the object from genuine Roman coins??

The Risley Park Lanx continues to be something of a mystery, not to say a
source of slight embarrassment to the British Museum, where it is no longer
on display. Deputy Director of The British Museum Andrew Burnett says the
lanx remains problematic. "There have been different views of it and it's
something we're looking at again in the light of the Amarna Princess case.
We haven't formed a final view on it yet."

The Risley Lanx case illustrates that there are good fakes and bad fakes and
good fakes often turn out to be as interesting as genuine pieces. This was
made clear in a 1990 exhibition at the British Museum ? Fake? - The Art of
Deception ? which featured objects from the entire museum spectrum. Andrew
Burnett says, "People tend to have a very polarised view of the world of
fakes and the world of genuine things and see a sharp and easy distinction
between the two. We need to get over to people that it is very difficult to
tell in a very considerable number of cases and opinions do change."

One member of the London Egyptology trade told Art Quarterly that he had
seen a number of pieces allegedly from the Lancashire source and that the
Amarna Princess was better than most of the things they'd done. "It was very
convincing, and not at all surprising that it fooled everyone."?

Clearly a combination of thorough research and genuine craftsmanship went
into the making of the Amarna Princess, suggesting that a network of
knowledgeable individuals was responsible.?

Another expert familiar with the Amarna Princess affair, who asked to remain
anonymous, says the alabaster carving is an example of "a good fake". "We
shouldn't be thinking of these people as Egyptological forgers, but as
people who make things," said the source. "Every curator sees lots of fairly
poor stuff every year and one can easily spot the workshops turning out fake
terracotta lamps. But the Amarna Princess falls into an altogether different
category and is a reminder that that the really good fakes in public and
private collections haven't been spotted yet."

Andrew Burnett concedes that, "It may be the case that there are more things
around," but adds, "There is no need for panic to set in. Fakes have been
around ever since people started collecting in the Renaissance and that will
always go on."?

The house raided by police in Bolton last year contained "ancillary
equipment" for fabricating an eclectic range of objects, making the
investigation all the more difficult. ?

Versatility has been a mark of some of the most successful fakers and
forgers. The notorious Italian sculptor Alceo Dossena (1878-1937) created
everything from Greek marble Athenas to 'Simone Martini' Annunciations
before he was discovered, while John Myatt, in league with his accomplice
John Drewe, created works in the style of everyone from Chagall to
Giacometti until arrested in 1995. ?

Like the Drewe case, the Amarna Princess reveals how today's forgers are
increasingly aware that it is not enough to fake the object; supporting
documentary provenance must also be fabricated. Nineteenth- and early
twentieth-century auction catalogues were not always illustrated and often
relied on scant descriptions alone, thus making it easier for fakers to
ascribe false histories to their counterfeit creations.

James Ede, director of leading London antiquities dealer Charles Ede Ltd.,
says the trend towards ever more convincing provenance-faking is the most
irritating aspect of the Amarna Princess case and others like it. "I hate
fakers and forgers with a passion because they're trying to undermine one of
the most valuable tools of the honest trade ? our approach to authentication
through diligent provenance research." Mr Ede believes, however, that the
Amarna case will not have any negative impact on the legitimate trade, but
everyone will learn from it. "My 'Black Museum' is enormous," says Mr Ede.
"I always say that one's ignorance is encyclopedic and any dealer who
doesn't occasionally inadvertently buy fakes isn't trying hard enough. We're
all human and we all make mistakes."

The main ammunition against fakes and forgeries is a combination of
provenance research, scientific analysis and old-fashioned connoisseurial
expertise, none of which is infallible. The Amarna Princess could not be
scientifically authenticated as stone is not amenable to testing, while the
provenance connecting the object to a late 19th century auction at Silverton
Park, Devon appeared to be convincing. As for connoisseurship, this too has
its limits as the quality of workmanship can often be entirely convincing.?

But is connoisseurship a dying art? Andrew Burnett believes not. "I think
there are fewer people around who know the material well personally, but
it's not a dying art. Connoisseurship will always remain very important. My
sense of scientific tests is that sometimes they can help you rule something
out, but they can very rarely prove that something is genuine. Hence the
connoisseur's knowledge of the object, of the materials and of who produced
it, will always remain very important."

As for the influence of the market, some commentators believe the
combination of rising prices and the easier routes to market via the
internet are encouraging illegal activity. In May 2000, Kenneth Walton, a
former lawyer, fabricated and sold a forged Richard Diebenkorn abstract oil
painting for $135,858. He recently wrote a best-selling book about his
exploits, perhaps proving that crime does pay.? Meanwhile, last year, a
number of fake spot prints by Damien Hirst appeared on the open market in an
attempt to cash in on the rapidly escalating prices for authentic examples.?

"This is one of the trends you can expect to see," says Dick Ellis. "The
last boom in the art market in the late '80s and early '90s was followed by
a boom in fakes and forgeries. Now the market is booming again. Over the
next five years you'll see a commensurate growth in the incidence of art
crime."?
? ?
In the event that the Greenhalghs are found guilty and their assets are
handed to Bolton Museum, The Art Fund will ask Bolton to repay a portion of
its grant for the Amarna Princess.?

?Thousands of heritage objects stolen?


PARLIAMENT ? Over 14,000 objects, artefacts and art works have been stolen
from South Africa?s museums, galleries and heritage institutions in the last
four years, the Democratic Alliance said on Friday.
?Our heritage... seems to be evaporating at a quite astounding rate,? DA MP
Dianne Kohler-Barnard told MPs in the National Assembly.
Speaking during debate on the arts and culture budget vote, she said the
management of the department -- which is ultimately responsible for
safeguarding South Africa?s cultural treasures -- was in a shambles.
The last Auditor-General?s report had found ?a whole new batch of problems
generated in the absence of any tangible leadership: assets misplaced, not
recorded, incorrectly recorded or just plain missing?, she said.
?Well over 14,000 heritage objects have been pilfered from our museums,
galleries, castles and even our churches ?over the past four years?.
?What bright spark decided that Pierneef?s ?Near Golden Gate' ?painting?
should hang unattended at the SABC in Johannesburg, despite being valued at
R5 million? It?s gone, along with 17th century ceramics from Cape Town, two
masterpieces from the University of the Eastern Cape, a Moses Seleko
sculpture from Pretoria... the list goes on and on.?
Kohler-Barnard asked Arts and Culture Minister Pallo Jordan why he kept on
repeating the same mistakes.
?Minister, why aren?t you doing your job? Why is it... that you keep on and
on repeating the same mistakes, hiring utterly incompetent staff?
?Do the people you hire not understand that leave has to be applied and
accounted for, that there have to be funds to pay for post-retirement
medical aid benefits, that fraud protection plans have to be instituted for
a reason?
?Minister, do they even know what a measurable objective is? The
Auditor-General doesn?t seem to think so.?
Art theft had been pinpointed as one of the top three global crimes,
Kohler-Barnard said.
Speaking at the end of the debate, Jordan rebuked Kohler-Barnard for
speaking ?as if she is the champion of the arts community?.
He made no reference to the disappearance of art works from institutions,
and said the DA had a ?schizophrenic attitude? towards his department. ?Sapa

Burglary at Kipling's former home  
 
Both table lamps had distinctive stained glass shades

Two Tiffany lamps worth tens of thousands of pounds have been stolen from a
former home of Rudyard Kipling. 

Bateman's, a 17th Century Jacobean property run by the National Trust, was
hit by burglars in the early hours. 

Police in East Sussex said the two lamps could have been stolen to order.
Nothing else was taken in the break-in. 

A National Trust spokesman said Kipling bought the lamps in the 1890s. "It's
because of their association with him that they're valuable to us," he said.


A burglar alarm linked to a security centre was activated at the property,
in Burwash, near Heathfield, at about 0200 BST on Saturday. 

Police said entry had been gained through a downstairs window. 

  It's obviously upsetting because these items are there for the public to
enjoy 

Jonathan Light, National Trust 

Det Insp Paul Phelps said: "One of our lines of inquiry is that the lamps
were specifically targeted, but it could also be that the offenders grabbed
what they could when the alarms sounded. 

"We would appeal to people within the antiquities market to be aware that
these lamps have been stolen." 

Bateman's was closed to the public on Saturday morning while forensic
examinations were carried out. 

Jonathan Light, from the National Trust, said the 12 to 18in-tall (30-45cm)
lamps had been on separate tables in a parlour room. 

"It's obviously upsetting because these items are there for the public to
enjoy, so it robs them as much as anything," he said. 

The building was not covered by CCTV cameras, but Mr Light said there would
have been security staff on site when the burglary happened. 

A lamp similar to one of those stolen has an auction guide price of at least
?5,000 on the Bonhams website. 

Bateman's also houses the author's original illustrations for The Jungle
Book.

Meteorite stolen from museum in Magadan, Russian Far East 
 12:48 | 09/ 06/ 2007  
 

VLADIVOSTOK, June 9 (RIA Novosti) - A chunk of a meteorite has been stolen
from a museum in the remote Magadan Region in Russia's Far East, a local
Interior Ministry spokesperson said Saturday.

Anna Chak said thieves broke into a history museum in the village of
Seimchan during the night and stole a part of the Seimchan meteorite. 

"A check is now being conducted," the spokesperson said. She said the
offenders may have been inspired by a recent TV program, which discussed the
high value of meteorites on the country's black market.

The first pieces of the Seimchan meteorite, which weighs over 7 kilograms
(15 pounds), were found in 1967 near the Seimchan gold mine in the Magadan
Region.

War, Tourists, Climate, Gazprom Threaten 100 Sites, Fund Says 

By James S. Russell

June 7 (Bloomberg) -- War, economic development and global climate change
pose threats to extraordinary buildings and cities, according the World
Monuments Fund's 2008 Watch List of the 100 most endangered sites. 

Released yesterday at the fund's Manhattan headquarters, the list ranges
from familiar locales like Machu Picchu and St. Petersburg to obscure ones
like the pinnacled mud-brick Wa Naa's Palace in Ghana and Leh Old Town, a
medieval Himalayan settlement in Ladakh, India. 

The WMF, which launched the biennial list in 1995, says 75 percent of the
sites it has listed in the past are out of danger, though many still need
considerable attention and investment. 

``Sounding the alarm helps advocates to join forces to protect our world's
shared architectural heritage,'' said Bonnie Burnham, the WMF's president.
The fund has awarded about $47 million in grants to Watch List sites, which
in turn has attracted an additional $124 million of governmental and
nongovernmental aid. 

Armed conflict and its aftermath have damaged or destroyed ancient
settlements in the Asian and Mesopotamian cradles of urban civilization. The
Watch List includes sites in the Middle East, Afghanistan,
Bosnia/Herzegovina, Cyprus and Sierra Leone. All of Iraq, which was on the
2006 list, appears on the new one. Fund grants are training Iraqi experts
who will return when conditions improve. 

Bamiyan Buddhas 

The destruction of great works of art can stoke long-held grievances,
explained Marilyn Perry, the WMF's chairman, or motivate aid. When Taliban
warriors blew up the monumental 7th- century Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan,
``the world wept for these great artifacts it had never known about,'' Perry
said. By listing it, the fund hopes to spur additional international efforts
to stabilize the site, which still possesses important wall paintings, and
assist in conservation of statue fragments. 

The WMF also has come to recognize the danger posed by global climate
change. Melting permafrost and rising seas threaten to swamp Herschel
Island, a historic Inuit whaling town in Canada. ``It may not be
salvageable,'' Burnham said. 

Frequent floods also afflict Sonargaon-Panam City, a medieval trading hub in
low-lying Bangladesh, while encroaching desert may destroy the Chinguetti
Mosque in Mauritania. In listing New Orleans, the fund worries that the
billions spent to date have yet to assure the future of its extraordinary
past. 

Loved to Death 

Some critically important places are being loved to death by insensitive
development. Poorly managed tourism threatens once-remote Machu Picchu, the
ancient Incan city in Peru. A tower for Gazprom, Russia's powerful oil
company, will deface the onion-domed low-rise skyline of St. Petersburg. 

The Watch List includes examples of important modern architecture, because
its significance often goes unrecognized until it's too late. The 2008 list
includes Florida Southern College, in Lakeland, Florida, an elegantly domed
and arcaded campus complex designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. 

The project was underfunded when it was built starting in the late 1930s,
and substandard materials were used. The maintenance and appropriate
adaptation of the structures for current needs has long vexed the college. 

Insensitive new buildings threaten the sublime vista to the ocean from the
Salk Center in La Jolla, California, a masterpiece by Louis I. Kahn. 

Sometimes listing can have immediate impact. Squabbling government agencies
have united behind a plan to conserve the Roman aqueduct in Segovia, Spain.
New funders have also stepped in to augment a $125,000 grant by American
Express. 

``Sometimes it's simply a matter of drawing attention,'' said John Stubbs,
the fund's vice president of field projects.

Volume 60 Number 4, July/August 2007  
by Heather Pringle  

The big business of treasure hunting is selling off the world's maritime
heritage-and it's perfectly legal.

Images:
http://www.archaeologyorg/0707/etc/insider.html


On the afternoon of October 24, 1865, Civil War veteran William T. Nichols
witnessed a scene aboard the steamship Republic more terrifying than many of
the horrors he had recently witnessed in battle. While en route from New
York to New Orleans, the ship, which was carrying 80 passengers and coins
then worth a reported $400,000, sailed through a fierce hurricane,
sustaining grave damage. As the wind howled, the vessel lurched sickeningly
from side to side, rapidly taking on water. The crew struggled heroically to
save it. "I cannot describe in words the impression which [the event] made
upon my mind," wrote Nichols, a former army colonel, to his wife. "It was
desperation intensified." A day later, Republic sank off the coast of
Georgia. At least 14 passengers perished. 


(Ken Feisel)
Settling on the ocean floor, the wreck rested undisturbed for nearly 140
years, preserving rare details of the Reconstruction era, "a brief period of
American history for which there are few known shipwrecks," says Robert
Neyland, an underwater archaeologist at the Naval Historical Center in
Washington, D.C. In the 1990s, however, an American shipwreck-recovery firm,
Odyssey Marine Exploration, Inc., began methodically searching for Republic.
It sent out a research vessel loaded with remote-sensing gear, and in the
summer of 2003, the company finally located wreckage from the ship in
international waters at a depth of some 1,700 feet. Under maritime law,
salvage companies are permitted to keep the ships they find in international
waters, provided no one else claims jurisdiction over the vessels. So
Odyssey staked a claim to Republic in a U.S. federal court, obtaining legal
ownership. Then, with a remotely operated vehicle (ROV), the firm raised
more than 51,000 gold and silver coins from the site, as well as thousands
of other artifacts, including hair-remedy bottles, mustard jars, children's
slates, and ink wells. To help finance its operations, Odyssey began selling
many of these finds to eager collectors, earning millions in revenues.
Impressed, Fortune Small Business magazine put the firm on its cover with
the headline: "Treasure Inc.: How an Entrepreneur Went Hunting for Sunken
Gold-and Found a $20 Million-a-Year Business." 

If a private corporation had targeted such an important site on land in the
United States and hawked many of its artifacts, heritage activists would
have been up in arms, asking hard questions about the commercial
exploitation of the country's cultural history. But there was no public
protest over the fate of Republic, and very little criticism in the press.
Moreover, this was not an unusual state of affairs-treasure hunters often
sell off shipwreck artifacts with scarcely a whisper of opposition. As a
journalist who has been writing about archaeology for 25 years, I find this
disturbing. Why isn't there more of a hue and cry against nautical treasure
hunting? Why does this industry seem to operate so freely? In search of
answers, I began closely examining the problem a year ago. I found, to my
dismay, that we have created a bizarre double standard for terrestrial and
marine sites, turning a blind eye to the fate of the world's shipwrecks. In
much of the world's oceans, treasure hunting is a perfectly legal
enterprise. 

Nautical archaeologists have long raised the alarm about this worrying state
of affairs, but their warnings have gone largely unheeded. The discipline of
maritime archaeology developed after World War II. With the field being so
new, many legislators and members of the public still do not realize how
much knowledge can be gleaned from the scientific investigation of a wreck,
including the conservation and careful analysis of artifacts. The problem is
further compounded by public perception: A certain swashbuckling, pirate
glamour cloaks the operations of many treasure hunters. 

To better understand treasure hunters and their operations, I paid a visit
to Paul Johnston, curator of maritime history at the National Museum of
American History in Washington, D.C. Since the early 1990s, Johnston, a
nautical archaeologist, has tracked the activities of treasure hunters
around the world, amassing an impressive archive of business prospectuses,
investor contracts, auction catalogues, reports, articles, correspondence,
and other documents. Johnston offered to share this information with me, and
I gladly took him up on it. Each morning of my visit, Johnston, a burly man
with alert, dark eyes and thinning, gray hair, greeted me at the museum's
security checkpoint and led me up to his office. Decorated with prints of
sailing ships and a map from his recent excavation of the sunken yacht of
King Kamehameha II in Hawaii, it was kind of a shrine to the nautical world.


Johnston's files revealed the broad spectrum of treasure hunting-from small
fly-by-night operations to large sophisticated corporations whose directors
include wealthy European nobles. And as we discussed the main players,
Johnston mentioned two major trends in the industry he had noticed. "I
definitely see a major movement toward deeper-water search and recovery," he
said, leaning back in his chair. For many years, treasure hunters stuck
mainly to the shallows, where divers equipped with scuba gear could work
easily. But increasingly, firms are shifting their focus to wrecks thousands
of feet below the surface. There they retrieve gold coins or antique
porcelain dishes by using ROVs equipped with video cameras and manipulator
arms, all under the watchful eyes of highly trained technicians. And the
steep cost of deepwater operations has led directly to the second trend that
Johnston observed. "I see a more businesslike approach to treasure hunting,"
he told me, "where charismatic individuals are being replaced by
corporations who have great funding and great technical ability." 

Johnston could not say with certainty how many of these firms are currently
combing the sea floor in search of wreck sites. Some companies operate in
secrecy, only publicizing their activities when their finds go to auction.
He estimated, however, that "there are probably somewhere under a dozen
serious treasure hunters worldwide." While some employ archaeologists to
assist in their operations, these researchers contribute relatively little
to scientific knowledge of ancient seafaring and ship design, as compared to
publicly funded archaeologists. 

Let me give an example. In the late 1990s, Texas A&M archaeologist Filipe
Castro and his colleagues excavated the wreck of a seventeenth-century
merchant ship off the coast of Portugal. Since then, Castro has diligently
attempted to reconstruct the vessel from hull to rigging, and test its
seaworthiness-something no treasure hunter has done, due to the grinding,
time-consuming analysis required. In pursuit of this goal, Castro has
published two scientific books and 26 articles on the wreck, and has
completed six archaeological reports. His students have written a master's
thesis and a doctoral dissertation on related topics, and Castro continues
to study the wreck, presenting his findings in scientific journals. By
contrast, Odyssey Marine's work on Republic is little known to the
archaeological community-even though, as the company cofounder, Greg Stemm,
pointed out to me, "Our budget on a monthly basis is more than the Institute
of Nautical Archaeology's annual budget [at Texas A&M University]." To date,
Odyssey's scientific staff has published just one book-on bottles recovered
from the ship. Of the five reports they have written on Republic, none
appears to have been published, although the company says it plans to post
them online. Moreover, Odyssey has now moved on to other shipwreck projects,
the most notable being the search for a treasure-laden seventeenth-century
British warship, HMS Sussex, off the coast of Spain. 

At heart, says Larry Murphy, chief of the Submerged Resources Center in the
National Parks Service, Odyssey and other such firms are about turning a
profit. "What's going on is that you are excavating sites under a commercial
timeframe, making commercial decisions about profit and loss, and you are
collecting artifacts for sale." 

Just how much of an impact has the treasure-hunting industry had on the
world's underwater sites? It's a difficult question to answer because no one
has ever compiled statistics on the total number of sites worldwide and the
number that have been damaged or disturbed by treasure hunters. But
archaeologist Don Keith, president of the Ships of Discovery research
institute at the Corpus Christi Museum of Science and History, thinks that
the movement of treasure hunters into deeper waters is a very worrying sign.
Indeed, one study that he and colleague Toni Carrell completed suggests that
treasure seekers have so depleted shallow-water wrecks that they are now
increasingly forced to target ships lying far below the surface. It's a
situation, explains Keith, that parallels the excesses of the oil industry.
Just as in oil prospecting, once you have found all the easy-to-reach
fields, you have to spend a lot more money to find the difficult,
hard-to-work ones. 

Keith is known among his colleagues as a thoughtful and deliberate man, with
a wry sense of humor. Like many in his profession, Keith has long worried
about the toll that treasure hunters are taking on the world's historic
shipwrecks. In 1998, he read a Scientific American magazine article
explaining how petroleum geologists estimate the amount of oil left in the
ground, and it dawned on him that he could apply the same technique to gauge
the number of shipwrecks left in the seas. 

 Is the world running out of shipwrecks? One recent study shows that in
three parts of the world-coastal Florida, Sussex County in England, and
along the various trade routes of the East Indiamen ships-half of all known
shipwreck sites were discovered before the mid-1970s. Borrowing a
mathematical model developed for the oil industry, the study suggests that
shipwrecks are a rapidly declining resource. [LARGER IMAGE] 

During the 1950s, American geophysicist Marion King Hubbert set out to learn
how much petroleum remained in the lower 48 states. In 1956, he observed
that the volume of oil that a particular oilfield produced tended to form a
predictable bell curve over time. Peak production occurred once about half
the crude in a given field was exhausted; after that, the rate of oil
extraction started tapering off. So Hubbert developed a mathematical model
to forecast when this halfway point would be reached. Today, geologists can
gauge the decline of oilfields in a region by using the Hubbert Model. 

To examine the situation with shipwrecks, Keith and Carrell began searching
for regional statistics on the numbers of discovered wrecks and the dates on
which they were found. They came up with detailed figures for two
geographical regions-the coasts of Florida in the United States and the
waters off Sussex County in England-as well as the famous trade routes that
East Indiamen ships once plied between Europe and Southeast Asia. The pair
then applied the Hubbert Model to all three statistical sets, which covered
the period from 1960 to 1998. "In each case," says Keith, "the curve for
shipwreck discoveries came out showing that the time between 1974 and 1976
was the peak." Such findings, he suggests, point to the immediate need for
strong conservation measures. "We concluded that more than half of the
shipwreck sites that will ever be found have already been found. So the
resource is being depleted very quickly, and when it's gone, it's gone."
Indeed, Keith and Carrell's data suggest that at the current rate, all wreck
sites off the coasts of Australia, Europe, Great Britain, Canada, the United
States, and in the Caribbean islands will have been found and exploited in
just another 30 years. 

I think Keith and Carrell's study shows clearly why treasure hunters are
spending so much money to recover artifacts from deepwater sites. Just as
oil companies now invest heavily in wresting crude from costly sources such
as the Canadian tar sands, commercial salvors are now increasingly forced to
look for historic shipwrecks in some of the most inaccessible parts of the
ocean. During the 1960s, treasure hunters spent just a few dollars a day
hunting for gold coins on a fleet of Spanish galleons that sank in shallow
waters of the Florida coast. Working Republic-with ROVs, a crew of 40, and
all the other technology-cost tens of thousands of dollars a day. 

So how do treasure hunters raise enough money to chase after the world's
ever-diminishing number of shipwrecks? As we sat over lunch in the museum's
staff cafeteria one day, Paul Johnston offered a colorful primer. Generally,
he explained, small private corporations target affluent investors. As the
prospectuses in Johnston's files disclose, they focus on individuals who
earn more than $200,000 annually and who possess a net worth exceeding $1
million-people who can readily afford to lose their investment. Often, says
Johnston, the owners of these companies call on affluent friends to help
round up prospects. In one case, Johnston wangled an invitation to a private
event held for Robert Marx, a legendary treasure hunter who claims to have
found a Roman ship off the coast of Brazil. The hostess, says Johnston, "was
a wealthy Philadelphia woman with strong social connections. As I remember,
she was some kind of princess, from a deposed Eastern European monarchy." At
the gathering, Marx "showed a movie of his work, told some stories, then
said he was looking for another ship and that it would be a good investment
opportunity, although you could lose every penny. Then he told the story of
the ship, with some embellishments." 

Blessed with charm and the gift of gab, successful treasure hunters often
possess an uncanny ability to latch onto investors. For more than 20 years,
legendary shipwreck-seeker Mel Fisher searched for Spanish galleons off the
coast of Florida, before finding the gold-laden Nuestra Senora de Atocha in
1985. But Fisher, who died in 1998, was almost equally renowned for his
prowess in attracting investors. He'd hunt for them as they bent their
elbows in the bars of Key West, and as they languished in senior-citizen
homes. As Cheryl Ward, an underwater archaeologist at Florida State
University told me, Fisher made a point of carrying a gold doubloon in his
pocket. When he'd meet someone for the first time, he'd drop it and let his
acquaintance pick it up. "He said when people touched it, they got gold
fever," recalled Ward. 

For these investors, Fisher often brandished a contract lasting just one
year. In it, he agreed to pay .01 percent of the treasure he raised in one
field season in exchange for an investment of $1,000. All payouts were to be
made in treasure, as opposed to cash, and Fisher was under no obligation to
raise all the gold he found in one year. Shortly after he found Atocha,
Money magazine investigated the soundness of such investments. While Fisher
claimed, for example, that the Atocha treasure was worth $400 million, Money
concluded that this figure was "almost surely wrong." All estimates of the
treasure's worth were supplied by Fisher or an associate, and were based on
the prices that starstruck tourists paid on impulse for coins in Fisher's
small museum gift shop in Key West, a place Money called, "the retail
bull's-eye." But the Atocha treasure commanded considerably lower prices in
independent coin shops, perhaps as little as 6 to 25 percent of the gift
shop prices. This was particularly bad news for Fisher's investors who had
to sell their payout-items of treasure-on the open market. 

By contrast, the large treasure-seeking corporations conduct their financial
affairs in a more conventional manner. Odyssey Marine Exploration, for
example, is publicly traded on the American Stock Exchange, and files
regular reports on its activities to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
These documents brim with details of complex financial maneuvers and a
network of subsidiary companies. And as befits a large private corporation,
Odyssey is hungry for profit and open to partnerships. In 2002, the firm
signed a highly controversial deal with the British government to find and
recover artifacts from HMS Sussex, a British naval vessel that is reputed to
have carried more than $1 billion (in today's dollars) worth of gold and
silver when it sank in 1694. If Odyssey is successful, it will split part of
the proceeds with the British government-a troubling precedent, I believe,
for a country that once prided itself on its naval and maritime heritage. 

Almost six years ago, the general conference of the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) recognized that
shipwrecks lying in international waters were in grave peril. It voted in
favor of adopting a new international treaty to safeguard them, the
Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage. Among its
many provisions, the convention states that "Underwater cultural heritage
shall not be commercially exploited," and it directs signatories to impose
sanctions on those who violate its measures. To date, 14 countries, from
Spain and Portugal to Panama and Mexico, have ratified the
convention-another six must do so before this treaty can take effect. 

The convention is not an ideal solution, but it is certainly a major step
forward for those intent on protecting the nautical past. Even so, many of
the world's leading maritime nations-including the United States and the
United Kingdom-have yet to ratify it. And as these governments drag their
heels, the clock continues to tick on the world's sunken ships. It's time to
put science ahead of the Almighty Dollar, and cultural heritage ahead of the
bottom line of private corporations. If we don't, we will truly be missing
the boat.

Drawing Returned After Theft 2 Years Before
Last Update: Jun 9, 2007 12:48 PM
    
MILWAUKEE (AP) - A Eugene Delacroix drawing of one of his paintings in the
Louvre Museum has been returned to a Milwaukee gallery after being stolen
nearly two years ago. 

The sepia drawing is called "Entry of the Crusaders Into Constantinople." 

The French romantic artist drew it around 1840 as a study for a larger
painting that now hangs in Paris. The drawing was priced at $45,000. 

Michael Goforth, the director of the DeLind Gallery of Fine Art, says a man
walked into the gallery yesterday afternoon and said he found the drawing in
the trash with the gallery's name on it. 

The man asked Goforth what he would give him for it and Goforth offered him
$100. The man asked that police not get involved and Goforth agreed and gave
him the money. 

Goforth says the drawing is irreplaceable and he cried when it was returned.

Museum closed after roof theft

Crystal Palace Museum has still not been reopened after water leaked into
the building a month ago when leading was stolen from the roof.

Thieves stole a substantial area of roof leading from the museum, in Anerley
Hill, in early May.

This meant after a heavy downpour on May Day bank holiday, water gathered
above the museum's ceiling, which then began to cave in.

"We had a disaster plan formulated, which we put in place," said Ken Kiss,
honorary acting curator and one of eight directors of the building.

"Staff moved the artefacts away from where we knew the ceiling would fall
in. Within 24 hours it had caved in but none of the items were affected."

The crime has meant the museum has been forced to close until all repairs
are completed by Bromley Council. "It's a shame it wasn't open for half term
last week," said Mr Kiss. "We hope it will be running again in a few weeks
time."

Police say there has been a spate of thefts of roof leading in recent
months, which they think is due to the high cash value of lead and copper.

The scrap value of copper went up ?500 per tonne from ?2,500 to ?3,000
between March and April this year.

The price of lead scrap per tonne went up ?50 from ?750 to ?800 over the
same period.
