Jim,

I would like to extend the Watch & Listen activity to the pool of activities.

Currently, we have a very stable version that plays amazingly on the
new b3 hardware. I know there have been issues in the past, and would
like to try and conquer them again.

What will it take to get the activity into the trial?

Thanks!

Justin Gallardo
