The Intel wireless hardware requires binary blobs to be loaded.  They
don't meet the Debian Free Software Guidelines and therefore cannot be
included in Debian.  Ubuntu has a looser set of rules and allows those
binary blobs to be shipped.  It is a simple matter to copy the
firmware into place if that is what you desire.  (I did.  I have the
Intel wireless too.)

It is a legal/philosophical thing and not a technical thing.  The
problem is not deducing how to make it work.  The problem is making a
free driver.

Perhaps more clear instructions need to be posted...
