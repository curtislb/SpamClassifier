After you're done the course, please write a review of whatever book you 
choose.  I think a lot of people would be interested.

The Windows GUI has a simple editor built in, that allows the work flow 
you want (but it doesn't have all the bells and whistles of ESS).  I'd 
recommend using it if you want simple installation:  it's just there.

There are a couple of shareware/freeware editors (WinEDT, Tinn-R) that 
have hooks to R.  WinEDT also has support for TeX/LaTeX; if that's 
important to you, it might be worth the cost/effort to install.  I'm 
less familiar with Tinn-R, but I believe it's free, whereas WinEDT is not.

If you want your students to link compiled C/C++/Fortran code to R, 
you'll need to install a number of tools that don't normally come with 
Windows.  See the R Admin manual or www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools.
