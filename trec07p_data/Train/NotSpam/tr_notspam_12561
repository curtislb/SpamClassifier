<B>TONIGHT ON SHOWBIZ TONIGHT - CNN HEADLINE PRIME 11pm
ET/PT</B>

<B>BRANGELINA REINVENTED!</B>
As Angelina Jolie premieres her shocking film based on the
story of a murdered reporter, only Showbiz Tonight goes
in-depth on the provocative ways Brad Pitt and Angie have
reinvented from pinup boy and wild child, to Hollywood royalty.


<b>FIRST REVIEW OF “A MIGHTY HEART”</B>
Showbiz Tonight with a special sneak preview -and review- of
Angelina Jolie’s emotional new movie, “A Mighty Heart.” She
plays Mariane Pearl, the widow of Daniel Pearl – the Wall
Street Journal Reporter who was kidnapped and killed by radical
Islamist terrorists.

<b>PARIS HILTON ANSWERS TO A HIGHER AUTHORITY!</B>
Just days before Paris gets locked up, Showbiz Tonight can tell
you --- she’s doing some serious spiritual reading and writing.
Why it looks like Paris has turned to prayer before prison.
Plus, how the famous-for-being famous hotel heiress may be
planning to cash in (like she really needs it, right?) on her
jail time – by putting pen to paper!

<b>KEVIN FEDERLINE’S EX, SHAR JACKSON</b>
K-Fed’s former flame (you know, the one he dumped Britney
Spears for) is right here. You can bet she’ll have a lot to say
about the Britney-K-Fed split and Britney’s comeback. Plus,
Shar's new reality show, ABC’s “Ex-Wives Club.”

<b>LOVE LESSONS FROM THE A-LISTERS!</b>
The co-author of “You Can’t Have Him – He’s Mine” is here with
some of the biggest celebrity relationship scandals – like the
Denise Richards, Richie Sambora, Heather Locklear love
triangle, what happened with Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt and
Angelina Jolie and Christie Brinkley and Peter Cook. What we
can all learn from these shocking stories!
