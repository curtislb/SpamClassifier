Lou Dobbs Tonight
Monday, April 30, 2007

Tonight, more than 100 American soldiers were killed in Iraq in
the month of April, making it the deadliest month this year. As
more violence befalls Iraq, not less, what are we doing to
stabilize the region? We’ll have a full report tonight.

California school officials are urging students to stay in
class instead of taking part in tomorrow's planned immigration
reform rallies. The largest rally in the state tomorrow is
planned for downtown Los Angeles, but it's unclear how many
will be students. Last year, an estimated 72,000 Los Angeles
students skipped school to join the demonstrations. We’ll bring
you that story tonight.

The U.S. Senate Trade Subcommittee held a hearing today on
“Halliburton and U.S. Business Ties to Iran.” It is illegal for
U.S. companies to do business directly with Iran, but a
provision in U.S. law allows foreign subsidiaries of American
companies to work with Iran provided they are operated
independently. Why is the law so vague? We’ll take a look
tonight.

America’s Toughest Sheriff, Joe Arpaio, is enforcing
immigration laws in Maricopa County, Arizona. Just last week,
his Illegal Immigration Interdiction Strike Force arrested two
more human smugglers, for smuggling unaccompanied minors.
Arpaio’s office is the only law enforcement agency in the state
arresting illegal aliens under a relatively new anti-smuggling
law, and under federal immigration laws. Arpaio’s office has
now arrested 523 illegal aliens under the state human smuggling
law and 71 under federal immigration law. We’ll have a special
report from Phoenix.

And in Time for Answers, we'll be joined by Republican
presidential candidate, Rep. Tom Tancredo. The congressman has
taken Lou up on his offer for two minutes of uninterrupted air
time to discuss the issues critically important to Middle Class
Americans.

Visit http://cnn.com/loudobbstonight to read Lou’s
latest commentary on how the mainstream media is intentionally
hiding the truth about illegal immigration, and for more on
tonight’s show.

Lou Dobbs lays out his manifesto to save the middle class in
his new book, “War on the Middle Class: How the Government, Big
Business, and Special Interest Groups Are Waging War on the
American Dream and How to Fight Back.” War on the Middle Class
is now on sale in bookstores near you and on Amazon.com and
BarnesandNoble.com.
