Pfizer Tries Boosting Its Image In Nigeria
June 23rd, 2007 9:18 am By Ed Silverman

adebamowo.jpgThe drugmaker is being sued by Nigeria for more than $9
billion over allegations its Trovan antibiotic clinical trials a decade
ago were improperly conducted, and killed or seriously harmed more than
100 children. Criminal charges are also being pursued.

To counteract a torrent of bad publicity, Pfizer this week trumpeted the
opening of Pfizer Oncology in the East, Central and Anglo-Lusophone West
Africa, to coordinate its cancer programs in the region, according to
The Daily Sun. The drugmaker sponsored a scientific symposium where
oncologists praised the drugmaker for its new business unit and two
cancer meds launched in the country.

“We need to have a better working relationship between the
pharmaceutical industry and the medical team. Such collaboration, of
course, has to be ethical and well organized. Having the major companies
selling the drugs for cancer in the country increases your confidence in
the product you tell your patients to buy,” Clement Adebamowo, a
professor of surgery at the University College Hospital in Ibadan, told
the gathering. “It is often difficult to monitor cancer patients. You
may not know when they are not doing well so, when major players on
oncology are on ground they will have interest in promoting the practice
and the quality of practice will improve.”

Coincidentally, Adebamowo (pictured) is a prominent member of the
Association for Good Clinical Practice in Nigeria, and three of its 17
board members are Pfizer employees in South Africa. The drugmaker also
co-sponsors AGCPN conferences.

At the same time, he directs the Univerity of Ibadan’s BioEthics program
and sits on the National Health Research Ethics Committee of Nigeria.
Adebamowo also contributed to a recent World Health Organization report
on designing studies and providing informed consent in poor countries.

With such credentials, Pfizer certainly knew who to trot out for the
occasion.
