Excellent. Sounds good.

And I agree about not forking. Mostly because it's just not necessary
- the application is in a much better position to know how to run the
service routine that accepts and processess these types of privileged
requests. Of course it wouldn't hurt to also provide a little server
program that calls the service routine that someone can run as root
or whoever.
