Hi Deepayan,

Your solution works, anf the polygon are drawn where I wanted them to  
go. I thought that I could figure out how to gain control over the  
colors of the four ensuing polygons (I'm trying to get two lighter  
shades of the lines).

I've tried, for example, to see if I could control the color of the  
polyon outline, by adding border = 'red' to panel.polygon. That  
didn't work. Does it work only in lpolygon()?

I often can figure things out on my own, but obviously there's  
something fundamental that I'm not getting about inheritance and  
passing in these sorts of objects. I've been trying to get it from  
the help pages and from Murrell's book, but neither offers enough of  
a cookbook for me to figure these things out. Is there something I  
should have read?

Thanks,
MIchael
