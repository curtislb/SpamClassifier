TONIGHT ON SHOWBIZ TONIGHT- CNN HEADLINE PRIME 11pm ET/ 11pm PT

<b>PARIS HILTON -- COUNTDOWN TO LOCKDOWN!</b>
Five days and counting until Paris Hilton has to start serving her prison sentence for violating probation. And there's word from friends and family that Paris is stressed out and scared -- what will she face as she gets ready to go behind bars? The inside story, tonight on TV's most provocative entertainment news show.

<b>IS HOLLYWOOD ENABLING LINDSAY LOHAN?</b>
As Lindsay Lohan gets treated in rehab, the producers of a movie she's set to start working on say they'll wait for her to get out. Are they giving her a well-deserved chance to get well, or should Lindsay face tougher consequences? The provocative questions, tonight on Showbiz Tonight.

<b>STARS WHO ARE UNLUCKY IN LOVE</b>
Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, Jennifer Aniston -- some of the most beautiful, talented, richest women in the world seem to have everything going great in their lives -- except their love lives? What gives? Why are these famous women unlucky in love?
