As a follow-up to this thread, I discussed the matter on #perl6 with 
Larry today (before the thread on mutable arguments), and I learned 
that one of my main concerns, of inconsistency between different 
collection types, is not valid.

http://colabti.de/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6?date=2007-05-17,Thu&sel=126#l221

1.  Not just Array, but also Seq can typically bind to both @ and $.

2.  Not just Hash, but also [Mapping,Set,Bag,Pair,etc] can bind to 
both % and $.

So its not just Array and Hash with the extra sigils, while 
everything else has only the $.

I now recommended that the Synopsis be updated to explicitly clarify 
such as these details, to make things less ambiguous for future 
readers, and they don't make the same mis-assumptions that I did 
about the limited scope of @ and % use.

That is, the Synopsis should explicitly state which are all the 
built-in types that could typically bind to each of the sigils (and 
everything can bind to $).

Larry thought that perhaps S02 would be the place for it.

In conclusion, I retract my previous suggestion of just using $ where 
we used to use @ and %.
