Hi,

Regarding the new artorg site, I have a few suggestions.

The main criteria for artwork creation would be better like "artwork
should be unified, and coherent rather than the current "pleasant, yet
unintrusive" Why? Because the latter ones are highly subjective terms
and hard even impossible to evaluate them since everybody has
different taste. While unity and coherence of the desktop can be
evaluated with objective terms.

Artists should be encouraged to develop entire sets rather than
individual pieces (wallpaper, splash and so on). This way unity and
coherence can be better maintained. When pick different pieces of
artworks and match them up later like a puzzle that always result bad
patchwork. A coherent but less artistic desktop always better than the
professional patchwork.

I am suggesting wallpapers without logo like ubuntu wallpapers. The
reason is because wide screen monitors can badly distort the logo as
they stretch the artwork, and a distorted logo looks very
unprofessional. This is a problem even with dedicated wide-screen
wallpapers because most novice users just don't bother changing them.


Regards,
Jmak
