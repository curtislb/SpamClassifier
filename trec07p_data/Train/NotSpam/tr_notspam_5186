I also disagree here quite strongly. I trust the perl community above
all other communities because it is unique in one respect. "There is more
than one way to do it".

The world is simply to complex to be crammed into a single paradigm
without having horrible blow-outs of *artificial* complexity all over=20
the place.

I like to use OO for some parts of a problem, more functional approaches
in others, and to bundle it all into a usable program there is only
one language: perl. With parrot I will be able to use multiple languages
with paradigm freedom. That is important to me as no superlative can convey.

Despite the generally higher intelligence of programmers, or maybe
because of it ... programmers are sucked into paradigm zealotry
to a degree that could be classified as cultish in human
behavior. Another explanation is that a paradigm is an investment,
once a developer "pays" for a paradigm they are reluctant to adopt
another.

Either way you cut the paradigm thing the only community in programming
that does not immediately trigger a full recall of Orwell's 1984 is the
perl community. Lisp does too, but by allowing you to create paradigms
with macros :)

so parrot is double-plus good. Truly adopting paradigm freedom requires
an intellectual transformation and commitement, no more training wheels,=20
no accepted practice to offer as an excuse for how things are written.=20
That and you have to use your own judgement case-by-case.
That will not come from places like Microsoft :)

Look at C#, java , they don't need to send mind-police , it's built=20
into the compiler.

This may sound elitish, but it is really not. It is easier , alot
easier to just apply the same old cookie cutters (patterns ?) to
every problem. Sometimes it makes good sense. But for the people
who are always feeling boxed-in by language paradigms I think=20
perl/parrot is where they will call home.

With perl 6 especially the quirky evolutionary flavor of perl 5
is replaced with a very clean language design. The only thing
left to turn people off will be the availability of choice.

In summary until microsoft/sun anoints Bruce Lee as their official
hero , with posters in every hall nothing like parrot will ever
come from those places. It's really hard to sell "having no way as
the way" as a industry band-wagon.

There is sympathy with that vision here.
