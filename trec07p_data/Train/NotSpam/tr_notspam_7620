Tom, Yes this works for my problem*your solution is quick and
eloquent*thanks*

I would be interested in a reference for PID monitoring for cases where
we have more that one *identical* spawned process to consider*

Thanks,

Steve

Can anyone

Do you really need to track the PID?

  while (1) {
    # restart the ksh script
    system $ksh_command;
  }

Does that do what you need? You could cook up a fancier solution with
fork, but I can't immediately see why you'd need to.

Cheers!
