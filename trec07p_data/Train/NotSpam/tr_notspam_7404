HEADLINES:
RICE URGES “WAIT AND SEE” WITH SYRIA AFTER MEETING WITH FOREIGN MINISTER
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said she delivered a "strong message" today to Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moualem about foreign fighters who are crossing Syria's borders into Iraq.  Rice met with her Syrian counterpart on the sidelines of a two-day conference on Iraq in the Egyptian resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh -- the first high-level meeting between the two countries in two and a half years.  Rice said she emphasized to the Syrian delegation "that everyone needs to do everything possible to stabilize this young democracy," referring to Iraq.  Asked if Syria agreed to halt the flow of foreign fighters into Iraq, Rice said she would take a "wait-and-see" approach. “I'm not convinced by words; I'm convinced by actions," Rice said.  At a U.S. military briefing in Baghdad, Major General William Caldwell said Syria has made some progress in halting the flow of foreign fighters into Iraq.  Rice said she had not seen Caldwell's statement, but cautioned against reading too !
 much into it.  "We don't want to assume this is a trend," she said.  "Let's wait and see if it continues."  A senior State Department official said Rice and Moualem also discussed Syria's role in Lebanon.

SECRET SERVICE: OBAMA PLACED UNDER PROTECTION AFTER THREAT
Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, a U.S senator from Illinois, has been placed under the protection of the Secret Service, the agency said today.  The government is not aware of any specific, credible threat against Obama, according to a law enforcement source familiar with the decision.  But the campaign has received hate mail and calls and other "threatening materials" in the past and during his campaign, the source said.  Three Obama campaign officials who discussed the issue on condition of anonymity also said there was no specific threat against the candidate. They said the request stemmed from what one called the "cumulative effect" of a heavier campaign schedule, larger crowds and "just the growing perception internally" it was time to take additional security precautions that are best suited for the Secret Service.  A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson also tells CNN there is no known specific or credible threat.  The Secret Service said in a !
 written statement that DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff, "after consultation with the congressional advisory committee, authorized the United States Secret Service to protect presidential candidate Senator Barack Obama.  "As a matter of procedure, we will not release any details of the deliberations of assessments that led to protection being initiated," the statement said.

“DEATH TRAP”: IRAQ SCHOOL, UNDER CONSTRUCTION, RIGGED WITH EXPLOSIVES
Today, the U.S. military said American soldiers a few days ago discovered that a girl's school under construction north of Baghdad was an explosives-rigged "death trap."  Soldiers were able to clear the scene, but Major General William Caldwell, U.S. military spokesman, said the “sophisticated" and "premeditated" effort to place munitions at the Huda Girls' School in Tarmiya was chilling.  The school is north of Baghdad in Salaheddin province. The building was found on Saturday.  If the explosives had been detonated, Caldwell tells CNN, it would have been "an incredibly ugly, dirty kind of vicious killing that would have gone on here by al Qaeda."  Soldiers saw wire snaking along a road into the building's wall, leading to an "explosive-filled propane tank" buried beneath the floor, the military said. There were artillery shells built into the ceiling and the floor, and another propane tank was found.  Inside the building, a military statement said, "The wire was very well c!
 oncealed with mortar and concrete. The propane tanks had been bricked over, and were completely underneath the floor."  The military refers to the set-up as an improvised explosive device. "Given the care and work put into emplacing this IED, it is likely it had been planned for a long time" and it is thought that "the IED was not intended to be set off until the building was occupied," the military said.  Authorities intend to question the Iraqis involved in the construction of the school.

WORK & ROMANCE CONTROVERSY: WOLFOWITZ DEFENDS ACTIONS REGARDING GIRLFRIEND
The war of words continues to swirl around World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz as he fights to hold on to his job.  Today, Wolfowitz released a letter sent to the special committee of World Bank directors that is investigating the controversy about the pay and promotion package Wolfowitz approved for his girlfriend, Shaha Riza.  Riza was transferred to a State Department foundation after Wolfowitz took over at the bank. She receives a salary of almost $194,000 a year, tax free.  In the new letter, Wolfowitz rebuts statements from former World Bank officials who claimed that he ignored Bank ethics committee directions on the Riza case and that he acted improperly.  Wolfowitz blames what he calls "ambiguous bank rules and unclear governance mechanisms."  And he says: "While I am prepared to acknowledge that we all acted in good faith at the time and there was perhaps some confusion and miscommunication among us, it is grossly unfair and wrong to suggest that I intended to misl!
 ead anyone and I urge the committee to reject the allegation that I lack credibility."  In Brussels yesterday, Wolfowitz brushed aside questions about his future at the bank, saying he and others should stay focused on the important work of the bank because there are millions of poor people around the world that depend on it.  Some of the criticism of Wolfowitz dates back to when he was No. 2 at the Pentagon and one of the chief architects of the Iraq war.  He also drew fire for his anti-corruption policy at the bank, which some long-time bank employees thought unfairly victimized the poor in certain countries. And there is some general resentment against the tradition at the bank that the president is always an American, named by the U.S. president.

DESPITE LACK OF DATA, FEDS ISSUE GUIDANCE ON FACE MASK USE IN FLU PANDEMIC
Today, the federal government issued "interim guidance" governing the use of face masks and respirators in the event of a flu pandemic, despite acknowledging that much is not known about whether they would help.  "We wish we had better science," Dr. Julie Gerberding, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters in a conference call. Although studies are under way, results may not be available for "a couple of years," she said.  As a result, she said, the disease agency has opted to base its guidance on "common sense...not the kind of scientific evidence CDC typically uses for its guidelines."  No mask or facial protection will suffice to eliminate the risk of a pandemic, Gerberding said. The best thing a person could do to avoid getting sick would be to avoid contact with people who are sick, she said.
