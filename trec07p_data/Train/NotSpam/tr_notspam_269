Licensing is a big issue in software. The way I prefer it is an easy 
license, a license which makes it possible that I can work on another 
PC, without paying a lot of money. R produces quite good results and is 
widely used. That makes it a statistical package that I want.
The other thing is that working with large datasets requires "some" 
effort by software makers to get it working. I doubt if R has the 
capability of working consistently with large datasets. That is an issue 
I think. I have done some comparisons between SPSS and R, and R seems to 
be performing allright, so I can do computations with it. Nonetheless: 
the data handling is not quite as good I think in comparison with SAS.

When I started doing statistics there were about three packages: SPSS, 
SAS and BMDP (at least: these were available). On a PC you were required 
to use SPSS.
Nowadays there are hundreds, some with excellent database facilities, or 
you can compute the newest statistical tests, or an exotic one. I 
haven't got a clue how to work with new database facilities. dBase was 
my only database education and everything has changed. So I cannot 
answer if R is capable of working with large datasets in relation to 
databases. I really don't know. The only thing I know that if I compute 
a ChiSq, it works on a relatively large dataset (not Fisher tests by the 
way). The same with a likelihood procedure, or tabulations including 
non-parametrics or factor analysis.   But databases are an issue I've 
been told by a guy who works with R. SAS was a better option he told me.

So what's the big deal about S using files instead of memory like R. I 
don't get the point. Isn't there enough swap space for S? (Who cares 
anyway: it works, isn't it?) Or are there any problems with S and large 
datasets? I don't get it. You use them, Greg. So you might discuss that 
issue.

The licences keep changing, some have in the past but don't now, some
you can get an additional licence for home at a discounted price. Some
it depends on the type of licence you have at work (currently our SAS
licence is such that the 3 people in my group can all have it installed,
but at most 1 can be using it at any 1 time, how does that affect
installing/using it at home).  I may be able to install some of the
software at home also, but for most of them I have given up trying to
figure out the legality of it and so I have not installed them at home
to be on the safe side.

Some of the doctors I work with who are also affiliated with the local
university have mentioned that they can get a discounted academic
version of SAS and could use that, but my interpretation of the academic
licence that one showed me (probably not the most recent) said (in my
interpretation, I am not a lawyer) that if they published the results
without paying a licence upgrade fee, they would be violating the
licence (the academic version was intended for teaching only).

The R licence on the other hand is pretty clear that I can install it
and use it pretty much anywhere I want.

You are right in correcting me, R is not the only package that can be
used on multiple computers.  I do think it is the most straight forward
of the good ones.
