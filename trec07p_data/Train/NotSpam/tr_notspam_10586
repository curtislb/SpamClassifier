Napster and Motorola Enter Unique Marketing Agreement for the US, UK and
German Markets

Award-Winning Napster To Go Service To Be Featured Across Extensive Line
of Motorola Music Handsets 


LOS ANGELES, May 15, 2007 /PRNewswire-FirstCall via COMTEX News Network/
-- Napster (Nasdaq: NAPS), the pioneer of digital music, and Motorola,
Inc. (NYSE: MOT), a global leader in wireless communications, today
announced a unique marketing agreement that will bring Napster's
industry-leading on demand music subscription service to mobile
consumers, offering free and easy access to a vast collection of music
and content across Motorola's entire line of portable
subscription-enabled devices. 

Napster and Motorola will develop promotional efforts for North America,
the UK and Germany designed to make it easy for consumers to experience
the unparalleled Napster music experience and load music content to a
full range of Motorola music-enabled and optimized handsets, including
the ROKR Z6 and Z6m unveiled today. The companies will also explore the
creation of unique and exciting new bundled music experiences at retail
for mobile music enthusiasts. 

The first phase of the multi-faceted marketing agreement provides mobile
music lovers with one free month of the award-winning Napster To Go
subscription service, enabling unlimited access to more than 3 million
songs, expert programming and exclusive content. The companies will
offer the service through in-box and aftermarket promotions, via retail
and carrier channels in the US and Europe, together with additional
promotional opportunities to be announced in the coming months. European
customers will also receive five free permanent downloads in addition to
their subscription. 

"Mobile music enthusiasts will enjoy the most popular music subscription
service to complement Motorola's sleek design and functionality that
delivers the ultimate mobile music experience," said Chris White, senior
director, Mobile Devices Multimedia Entertainment, Motorola. "Our
relationship with Napster further advances Motorola's global music
strategy and presents an incredible opportunity to expand the company's
strong music ecosystem." 

"Motorola's powerful global brand image, music-enabled handset portfolio
and exceptional market positions, present tremendous potential for
Napster to further deepen and broaden its global presence," said Chris
Gorog, chairman and CEO of Napster. "We are very pleased to announce
this new global relationship which supports our focus on driving
adoption of our subscription model by attaching to music enabled cell
phones which are expected to become the dominant device for portable
music over the next few years." 

Napster To Go is compatible across Motorola's extensive portfolio of
music-optimized and enabled phones which feature Window Media DRM. The
first retail music experiences are expected to launch across North
America and Europe in the second half of 2007.
