That packages collection gets enlarged by those that can make packages and 
submit them on http://www.linuxpackages.net and other slackware 
repositories.  Earlier I managed to get some sources built but didn't 
manage to figure out the steps to make those applications into packages. 
I'll take some time and read through that documentation again, maybe I'll 
figure it out this time.
