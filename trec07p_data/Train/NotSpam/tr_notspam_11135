Napster Hits Record Fourth Quarter Revenues of $29.1 Million and
Completes Fiscal 2007 Leading the Industry in On-Demand Music
Subscribers




LOS ANGELES, May 16, 2007 /PRNewswire-FirstCall via COMTEX News Network/
-- Napster (Nasdaq: NAPS) today reported financial results for its
fourth quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2007. 

Net revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 grew to $29.1 million,
up 9 percent from $26.8 million in the prior year quarter and up from
$28.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2007. Net loss for the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 was $8.5 million, or $0.20 per basic and
diluted share, compared to net loss of $9.5 million, or $0.22 per basic
and diluted share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2007. Net loss
narrowed $1.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 compared to
the same quarter of fiscal 2006 excluding the after-tax impact of a $5.4
million gain from the sale of the consumer software division as
recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. 

Net revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 was $111.1 million,
up 17% from $94.7 million in fiscal 2006. Net loss for fiscal 2007 was
$36.8 million, or $0.85 per basic and diluted share, compared to net
loss of $54.9 million, or $1.28 per basic and diluted share, in fiscal
2006. 

"Napster concludes fiscal 2007 as the most popular on-demand music
subscription service with healthy annual revenue growth and a
significant decline in cash burn," said Chris Gorog, chairman and CEO.
"Looking ahead to fiscal 2008, the company will remain deeply focused on
bottom-line improvement and will continue to capitalize on our strong
market share position as we enter the new era of music-enabled cell
phones. We expect this trend to be a substantial contributor to
Napster's future growth based on our partnerships with the leading
wireless carriers and handset manufacturers worldwide." 

At the end of March 31, 2007, Napster's total worldwide paid subscriber
base was 830,000, including university subscribers, Napster Mobile
subscribers, Napster Japan subscribers and the AOL Music Now subscribers
who transitioned in March 2007. The number of paid subscribers grew 47
percent from the third quarter of 2007 and 37 percent year over year. 

Napster ended fiscal 2007 with a total of $66.5 million of cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments. 

Business Outlook 

"We believe that Napster is very well positioned strategically in the
market, and with the successful integration of the former AOL music
subscribers into Napster we expect revenue will increase to
approximately $31 million in the June quarter. Our fourth quarter cash
burn from operations decreased to approximately $3.3 million, excluding
our one-time payment to AOL, and we expect that quarterly cash burn will
further decline in fiscal 2008, reflecting our focus on lowering
expenses while maintaining our revenue growth trajectory," said Nand
Gangwani, Napster's chief financial officer.
