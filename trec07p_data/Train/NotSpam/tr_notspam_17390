Hi, Shane:

I'm not myself competent to give you a really intelligent answer about all
these details. However, I can tell you that we're supported by multiple
speech drivers in open source, inclugind gnome-speech, py-ibmtts, and
our own speakup-connector. You can certainly look at the source of these
without spending money for the TTSynth product. I believe you'll find
multiple approaches.
