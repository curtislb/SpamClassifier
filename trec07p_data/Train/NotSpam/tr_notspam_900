Thanks Marc. 

I had seen a reference to that and lost it.  I'll get
a copy. However the major purpose of using sas.get
is/was to keep the value labels and variable labels.  

For the number of times in a year that I need SAS ,
the 5 minute walk to the nearest lab with SAS etc is
not a problem. 

At the moment I will probably have to resort to the 
SAS > SPSS > R route. A pain but not that bad. At the
moment I am finding it easier to import the SAS file
into SPSS than to load it in SAS.
