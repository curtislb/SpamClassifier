Yes. You did all that. I was extremely grateful for that input. And I took it 
(and many other's people's feedback) and created the current design...in such 
a way--I believe--that you *will* be able to easily and extensibly use the new 
Pod and Perl parsers to implement such integrated documentation strategies.

Agreed. And I made sure that Pod 6 could be easily extended with such markup. 
Moreover I added in the concept of "semantic blocks", which directly mirror 
many of your MARKOV language notations, often right down to the actual names 
chosen (albeit in capitalized form).

By all means. But not for my sake. I have already studied and understood your 
tool and the advantages it provides for certain types of documentation tasks. 
That's why I designed Pod 6 specifically to support such tools.

Understood. But you keep saying we're not giving you what you want, without 
showing us specific examples of what it is you want that we're not giving you. 
What else can we do but ask you to provide specifications for the pieces you 
think are missing?

And, no, I don't consider the pointers to your excellent module to be suitable 
specific examples of what we're not giving you...mainly because I believe that 
the Pod 6 documentation language I've designed (in conjunction with the 
ability for Perl 6 to parse Perl 6) *does* give you what you need to build 
such tools.

So it seems we're still at an impasse. I fully respect your decision not to 
attempt a full alternative design (if anything, your estimate of it only 
taking "weeks" is optimistic ;-), but unless someone is willing to step up and 
suggest some specific improvements to the current proposal, how can we move 
forward towards the best possible result?
