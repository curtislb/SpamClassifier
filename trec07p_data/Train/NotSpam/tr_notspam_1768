Hi,

Thanks for the reply, I think that I understand you point.
Now I am starting to fear cpan installations. 
Is there a chance that by doing a simple - naive cpan installation of a module I, potentially, can damage another installed module?


Best regards,

Yaron Kahanovitch

The problem is that there's no promise that package A and B from the CPAN
don't both install file C.  So any naive packager/installer will fail.
It takes *hand* tuning by the distro makers to get this to play well.
