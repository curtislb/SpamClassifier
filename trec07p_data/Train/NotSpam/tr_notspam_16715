Hit "o" to go to the options, go down to the check box that says "save 
options to disk" and check it.  Next, go down once and change "user mode" 
to advanced.  Next, go to "keypad mode" and set it to "links are 
numbered."  Then, work your way down to "show cursor" and turn that on as 
well.  Lastly, go all the way to the top and hit enter on "accept 
changes."  This will make life a lot easier.  I can't recall if you have 
to exit lynx or not to have the changes take effect.
