Hi,

Can you provide examples of data formats that are problematic to read and
clean with R ?

The only problematic cases I have encountered were cases with multiline
and/or  varying length records (optional information). Then, it is sometimes
a good idea to preprocess the data to present in a tabular format (one
record per line).

For this purpose, I use awk (e.g. http://www.vectorsite.net/tsawk.html),
which is very adept at processing ascii data files  (awk is much simpler to
learn than perl, spss, sas, ...).

I have never encountered a data file in ascii format that I could not
reformat with Awk.  With binary formats, it is another story...

But, again, this is my limited experience; I would like to know if there are
situations where using SAS/SPSS is really a better approach.
