ok, having looked through some of the source now...

I don't know yet what config.pir and config.fpmc are good for, they seem to
be just returning the same thing that's stored inside the Parrot executable
as getinterp[.IGLOBALS_CONFIG_HASH].

AFAICT, runtime_prefix checks the PARROT_RUNTIME env variable and then
defaults to whatever the config hash has under the 'prefix' key.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding the function of runtime_prefix (it is used in
library.c in Parrot_locate_runtime_file_str as a search path) but I think
that if I'm wrong, at the very least the installed Parrot's config hash
should contain another 'runtime_prefix' key which would have the values I
was expecting. (Assuming runtime/parrot really does get installed to a
single directory. If the directories inside runtime/parrot don't necessarily
have to be installed in the same place, then there'd be a key for each.)
