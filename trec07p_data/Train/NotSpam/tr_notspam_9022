I have tried everything I can think of tonight!

all of the proper kernel devel, and source packages
are all properly installed, as far as I can tell....

yet I get millions of errors and no module...

I tried using -I in the makefile for dtpc just to see
what effect using /usr/include has versus say
/usr/src/kernels/2.6.18-8.el5-i686/include
and anything else I could think of.

So if anyone out there is paying attention,
and has any ideas how this properly done, PLEASE
please please contact me.

We should create a modern version of this source code.
Apparently what is available now is not entirely
compatible; or more precise, more exacting
instructions
are needed.

If you accomplish creating a dectalk pc kernel module
for 
Linux centos 2.6.18-8.el5 #1 SMP Thu Mar 15 19:57:35
EDT 2007 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux

and share with me the secret it took to accomplish it.

thanks.
