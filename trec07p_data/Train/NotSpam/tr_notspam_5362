Tommi has told me in a private email he doesn't want people to modify
his music, which is reasonable although it means the music won't be
DFSG-Free.  I have cobbled together a possible license you could use.
The license text is pasted below.  (It is based mostly on parts of the
BSD and MIT/Expat licenses and snippets from the GPL, CC-BY-ND and
Open Font licenses and some of my own words.  I hereby release the
license text itself to the public domain.)

Tommi, Sami, Joonas, do you think Teosto might possibly be willing to
let you distribute the music under the terms below?  If so, could you
please ask Teosto's lawyer?  The music can't get into the Debian
non-free repository until we get permission to distribute it.

Tommi, the license lets people modify the music, but not rearrange it
or change the lyrics.  That ensures people will be able to convert it
from one audio format into another and such, and to be able to change
the speed and/or pitch in case some Frets On Fire "Turbo Mode" mod
comes out that allows that.  Are you comfortable if your music is
released under those terms?  Cheers, --Jason
