VIDEO SLAM Needs You!

Want to learn how to use Creative Commons licenses? OPEN CHANNEL is calling for registrations for participation in a new production initiative, Video Slam.

Video Slam is an Arts Law Week workshop from OPEN CHANNEL exploring the use of Creative Commons licenses for the creation of original digital content.

Over 48 hours filmmakers, writers, programmers, sound and video artists will slam out a 10-minute digital short from content found largely on the Web.

Individuals and teams will each create unique fragments towards a complete narrative, perhaps one editor to each scene, or five composers scoring two minutes a-piece, or three actors performing the same part directed by four directors!

The final piece will be simulcast from Horse Bazaar to Federation Square, OC Online and EngageMedia.

If you have skills or interests in any of the following areas, complete our registration form or write to us for more information. We’re looking for:

Directors, Camera and Sound operators, Editors, Musicians and/or Composers, Sound and Lighting Designers, Writers, Actors, Audio/Visual artists, Graphic Designers, Animators, 3D artists and most importantly, Production Assistants.

Registration form:
http://openchannel.org.au/artslaw/

Registration fee: $22 / $15 OC Members

More information:
<artslaw@openchannel.org.au>

All registrants will be reviewed by our esteemed Video Slam coordinators: filmmakers and audio visual artists Dale Nason, Tintin Wulia and Andrew Garton. Also participating in the Video Slam are Elliot Blesdoe (Creative Commons Clinic) and Shaun Miller (Marshall's & Dent). 

Thanks to Horse Bazaar, Creative Commons Clinic and Federation Square for their support.
