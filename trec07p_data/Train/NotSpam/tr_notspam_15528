   Tonight, on both Linux and Darwin, I configured with the '--test' option to
   Configure.pl that runs, among other things, the build tools tests once
   Configure.pl itself has completed.  These tests generally always pass -- and
   they did so tonight -- but tonight one test ran with warnings not previously
   seen . . .

   . . .

   I suspect the problem is to be found either in lib/Parrot/Pmc2c/Pmc2cMain.pm
   or in src/pmc/default.c.  Could whoever has been working on these files in the
   past few days please take a look at this?  The warnings are of very recent
   origin.

   Thank you very much.

This is from the "Small tweak to Pmc2c.pm" I posted on 19-May and
committed as r18646 on 26-May.  Note that lib/Parrot/Pmc2c.pm is not
actually doing anything different now, it's just telling you that none
of the code for these methods is being used in the generated C file.  So
they are certainly not being tested now, and possibly haven't been for a
while.
