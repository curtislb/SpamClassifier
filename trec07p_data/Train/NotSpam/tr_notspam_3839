<b>Coming up this Sunday on Reliable Sources:</b>

<b>Multimedia Manifesto</b>

Did NBC make a big mistake in airing the troubling, violent pictures and videos of Virginia Tech gunman Seung-Hui Cho?  Since the package landed at 30 Rock and led the Nightly News Wednesday, a vicious debate has erupted and an angry public has convinced many of the media outlets who followed suit to scrub the images from their broadcasts.  We'll go right to the decision-maker, NBC News President Steve Capus, and get reaction from talk radio hosts Hugh Hewitt and Bill Press, and the Philadelphia Inquirer's Gail Shister.

<b>A Safe Distance</b>

Where should we draw the line between aggressively covering a story and invading the privacy of a community?  As some students and families ask for room to grieve, have reporters allowed them enough space?   We'll talk to three reporters who covered the story on the ground in Blacksburg, Sharyn Alfonsi of CBS News, Gene Robinson of the Washington Post, and CNN's Soledad O'Brien.

<b>New Media, New Questions</b>

Jamal Albarghouti's dramatic video, captured with his cell phone, instantly provided an eyewitness account of the Virginia Tech incident to the world.  What are the promises and potential pitfalls of having so many people armed 24/7 with a video camera?

<b>Plus,</b> MySpace and Facebook helped drive the coverage, giving reporters and bloggers intimate portraits of some victims, and generating backlash from students who just want the press to back off.  We'll get a new media perspective from Townhall's Mary Katharine Ham and Jeff Jarvis of Buzzmachine.com.

Join us this Sunday and every Sunday at 10am ET / 7am PT for our critical look at the media!
