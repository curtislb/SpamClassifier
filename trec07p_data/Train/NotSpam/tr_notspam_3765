[0]Kelson writes "NPR's Marketplace is reporting on a [1]new
authentication scheme. BioPassword tracks the way you type your password:
how long each key is depressed, the time between keystrokes, and overall
speed. When someone tries to log into your account, it compares the
pattern to what it has on file. It only allows you in if both the
password and patterns match. The technique has been around a while. World
War II Morse code operators used it to determine whether a message was
sent by an ally or an impostor."

installed on a single aircraft, the system utilizes technology from
British company Aeromobile, providing a miniature GSM 'tower' within the
aircraft cabin. Since GSM phones dynamically adjust their transmit power,
being in such close proximity to the tower means that phones will emit
only minimal RF. The system operates as a separate 'country', meaning
phones must be enabled for international roaming and calls are charged at
international roaming rates. During the trial at least, only SMS, MMS,

numbers and discusses the role the Wii and DS have had in revitalizing a
company the WSJ refers to as an 'also-ran'. "To take better advantage of
the Wii's growth, EA moved quickly to ramp up game production for the
system, acquiring Headgate Studios, a developer in Utah focused entirely
on making titles for Nintendo hardware, and shifting resources in other
EA development groups to Nintendo projects. The company released four
titles for the Wii in March, including a version of its Tiger Woods golf
game in which players swing the Wii controller like a club. EA is also
working on a line of consumer guides for the Nintendo DS that will be
aimed at older players in Japan."

effective treatment for HIV in the future. 'Tweaks to its amino acid
components boosted its anti-HIV potency by two orders of magnitude. Tests
also showed that some derivatives of the molecule are highly stable in
human blood plasma, and non-toxic even at very high concentrations. A
synthetic version of VIRIP also proved effective at blocking HIV,
excluding the possibility that some other factor was responsible. VIRIP
targets a sugar molecule which HIV uses to infect a host cell. '"

capital, Caracas, have [1]bought three airship UAVs to keep tabs on the
local populace. From the article: 'The 15 metre (49 foot) long air ships
are emblazoned with government slogans. Written in bright red are the
words, We watch over you for your security.' They're not exactly black
helicopters, but how long do you think until we see similar measures in
high-crime American cities?"

I imagine it's been a hard week for a lot of people; gamers in particular
have been jumping to defend their hobby from the likes of [0]Dr. Phil and
[1]Jack Thompson, both of whom were quick to link gaming and the tragedy
in Virginia. Despite their vigor, it seems like game enthusiasts can
breathe easily this week. As far as most people can tell, [2]gaming was
in no way involved. Even the mainstream media is coming to realize that
[3]gaming isn't always the right place to turn when youth violence grabs
the headlines. Just the same, some activist gamers are still trying to
make sure their hobby comes out of this unscathed, and at least some
folks think [4]they may be overdoing things: "While I'm all for activism
for one's beliefs, I really think this may do more harm then good. As
gamers, we feel a need to defend our passion, but we run the risk of
ending up looking no better than those seeking to shift blame, while
further disrupting the already-mourning. I say that the thing to focus on
at this point is simply remembering those lost and cherishing what we
still have. Now's not the time for political vendettas, and gamers need
to step down and just humbly accept the fact that blame will always be
shifted to the popular youth activities: be it a KISS concert, a video
game, or something else."

msblack writes "The New York Times is reporting that an Office of
Management and Budget website [0]accidentally exposed at least 30,000
social security numbers publicly online. As many as 100,000 to 150,000
individuals may have been affected. The cost to taxpayers just for
notifications and credit monitoring is estimated to run $4 million.
'While there was no evidence to indicate whether anyone had in fact used
the information improperly, officials at the Agriculture Department and
the Census Bureau removed the Social Security numbers from the Census Web
site last week. Officials at the Agriculture Department said Social
Security numbers were included in the public database because doing so
was the common practice years ago when the database was first created,
before online identity theft was as well-known a threat as it is today.

An anonymous reader writes "[0]Using radio to eavesdrop on CRTs has been
around since the 80s, but Cambridge University researchers have now shown
that [1]laptops and flat-panel displays are vulnerable too. Using basic
radio equipment and an FPGA board totaling less than $2,000 it was
possible for researchers to read text from a laptop three offices away.
'Kuhn also mentioned that one laptop was vulnerable because it had metal
hinges that carried the signal of the display cable. I asked if you could
alter a device to make it easier to spy on. "There are a lot of innocuous
modifications you can make to maximize the chance of getting a good
signal," he told me. For example, adding small pieces of wire or cable to
a display could make a big difference.'"

Office. 'While the entry of the iPhone (with its cut-down version of Mac
OS X) into this market offers new options for consumers, Sorenson
believes user familiarity with the Windows Mobile interface -- and the
ease with which companies can buy and develop applications for the
platform -- will sustain its increasing popularity and help keep the
iPhone out of the lucrative corporate market.'"

slashdotmsiriv writes with a link to an International Business Times
article about Russia's plan to [0]build floating nuclear power plants (a
subject we discussed some time ago). [1]The project is getting a lot of
flack over possible safety problems from green groups. "The first
floating power plant will be named 'Academician Lomonosov.' Mikhail
Lomonosov was an 18th- century Russian scientist who achieved worldwide
acclaim for his work in chemistry and physics and was founder of Moscow's
state university. Customers could include Russian state-controlled gas
giant Gazprom, the northern region of Chukotka and countries from Namibia
to Indonesia, according to industry sources."
