Either my CD-Rom is scratched, or my new virtual machine is attempting to 
boot off of an non-existing hard-drive file or something, instead of the CD. 
Does anyone know how to varify that VMWare workation 5.X (at least) boots 
off a CD-Rom/? I'm trying to install Linux via  a virtual machine.
Also, does anyone else know how I'd be able to mount my card reader (wich is 
used by Windows) so that the VMWare box could use it?
Regards,
--Keith.
