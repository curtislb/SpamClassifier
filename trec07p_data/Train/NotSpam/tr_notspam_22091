     On the install DVD/CDs, you'll find a directory named "slackbook." 
  Not only does it teach you something about Slackware, but a little 
about Linux itself.  Use your web browser and load the index.html file. 
  It sounded like a pretty well written pamphlet on the system.  I'm 
used to books being a little larger. <grins>  I assume you'll have to 
visit Sourceforge for additional packages and install them into 
/usr/local.  How they missed dos2unix I don't know, but the 'tr' command 
should do for removing carriage returns.
