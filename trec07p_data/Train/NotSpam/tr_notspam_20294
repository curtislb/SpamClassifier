Hi all

I just spent the last two weeks building a LFS system then installing 
necessary packages from the BLFS book.  Now, I am to the point of installing 
software speech.  Speech-Dispatcher is installed, as is Speechd-Up.  Espeak 
is my synth of choice.  I also setup my kernel to compile sftsyn as a 
module.  In the default synth field in the kernel, though, I have ltlk as 
that is my primary synth.  I have verified that Speech-Dispatcher and 
Speechd-up are working because I performed the speechd-up probe test and it 
was spoken.  The problem happens when I do modprobe speakup_sftsyn.  The 
system simply freezes; no speech, no beeps, nothing.  In fact, I'm forced to 
restart forcefully with the ower button.  Where should I look to find 
whatever error may be occurring?  If I need to get sighted assistance, 
that's not a problem.

Thanks,
Robby
