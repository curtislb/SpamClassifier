I'm having trouble with my Samba PDC, the client machines wont download =
the default profile from the Samba PDC, I have read your article =
"[Samba] Roaming Profile & Folder Redirection Problems" and I'm not sure =
if the problem is on the client side, I suspect the server configuration =
but I'm new to Samba, and I'm using John Terpstra's book but I cant find =
the answer to my problem.

Here is my scenario
  I am a teacher in South Africa, I have a completely isolated (network =
wise) computer lab with 40 windows 2000 professional workstations, and 5 =
completely different groups of users, requiring completely different =
software, I would like to restrict each group from using the other =
groups software, I am trying to set-up this up using samba 3.0.24 =
running as a PDC, and with mandatory default profiles. In addition to =
this each user/student requires his/her own folder on the server to save =
files.

  I have read the Samba HOWTO and TOSHARG, I have successfully installed =
the PDC and I can connect to it from my client machines, I am also able =
to save files into different user directories, I am stuck on the profile =
default part.
Can you please help me, I have attached a copy of my smb.conf file?

Thanks in advance for your help

Kind regards
Pat Beyer
