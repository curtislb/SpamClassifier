Lou Dobbs Tonight
Friday, April 20, 2007

Tonight, An ongoing battle over the war in Iraq. Senate
Majority Leader Harry Reid says the war is lost – but the Bush
administration says it’s not.

The House Education and Labor Committee is holding a hearing on
a billion dollar reading program that the Education Department
is believed to have botched. The Reading First program was
created in 2002 under the No Child Left Behind Act to help
children to learn to read. But now it's being investigated over
allegations of conflict of interest and contracts that favor
vendors who provided a product that some say wasn’t the best on
the market. We’ll have a full report.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson is in New York City today
speaking before the Committee of 100 on the importance of the
United States’ economic relations with China. Meanwhile China
continues to sidestep U.S. demands to level the playing field
with regard to trade. Join Lou tonight for a full report.

The wife of an imprisoned Chinese dissident has filed suit
against Yahoo!, claiming the company voluntarily handed over
information to the Communist Chinese government that led to her

husband’s arrest and subsequent torture. China continues to
crackdown with more controls over internet use. What’s behind
the Great Firewall? We’ll bring you that story tonight.

Staff Sergeant David Fitzpatrick has a job most people would
run from. He handles explosive ordinance disposal for the U.S
Air Force, putting himself in direct contact with the bombs and
I.E.D’s that have killed or injured so many of our troops in
Iraq. The Bronze Star recipient is humble about his highly
dangerous job. We’ll have a special report.

Should Attorney General Alberto Gonzales be fired? Former White
House Political Director Ed Rollins, New York Daily News
Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Michael Goodwin, and
Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf join us.
