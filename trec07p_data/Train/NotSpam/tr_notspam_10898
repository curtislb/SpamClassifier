Dear all, 
the question was if lmer can estimate the variance components correctly, although my design is very UNbalanced.
Also, how do I find the percentage of the variance from every component? Do I have to add all the varianc components and then divide each one by the total?

Thanks

P.S. lmer is excellent. It can estimate large datasets where SPSS gives me error messages and says it cannot estimate them. Keep on good work friends!!!!!

It was my mistake.  I fixed the problem in the development sources
long ago but I haven't uploaded a new release since doing so.   I'll
upload a new release next week - this is finals week for us and they
seem to expect that we will do things like grade exams rather than
debugging code. :-)

Not really.  It is a benign cut-and-paste error.  If you want to fix
it now look for the function printMer in the source file lme4/R/lmer.R
and change the default for the symbolic.cor argument to FALSE.

So, I have three scores for English (one for every term), three scores for maths etc. However, not everybody was examined in maths, not everybody was examined in English etc, but everybody was in effect examined on four subjects. I also have information abouit the school. Would this model hive the right results for the variance components?
