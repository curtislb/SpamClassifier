11:38 AM, 6/18/07, Update: Critical orientation control test appears to go =
smoothly=20

Control of the international space station's orientation was turned over to=
 Russian computers and rocket thrusters today in a critical test to confirm=
 the attitude control system is working properly in the wake of crippling c=
omputer crashes last week. As of this writing, the test was still underway =
but NASA officials said it appeared the system was functioning smoothly, a =
requirement before the shuttle Atlantis undocks on Tuesday.

The test began after the shuttle's rocket thrusters were used to re-orient =
the station for a shuttle waste water dump. When the excess water had been =
dumped overboard, flight controllers maneuvered the station back to its ori=
ginal orientation, or "attitude," and switched control over to the revived =
Russian guidance, navigation and control computers. The computers then comm=
anded Russian thrusters to maintain the proper attitude for about an hour.

Control of the Russian thruster system then was switched to U.S. computers =
and again, the hardware and software worked together as required during the=
 latter stages of the test to keep the station stable and pointed in the ri=
ght direction. The results of the checkout operation will be reviewed by NA=
SA's Mission Management Team later today. Barring additional problems, the =
Atlantis astronauts are expected to be cleared to seal hatches between the =
spacecraft this evening to set the stage for undocking on Tuesday.
