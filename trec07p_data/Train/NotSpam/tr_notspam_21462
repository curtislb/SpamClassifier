Sadly, I must admit that I'm operating way outside of my knowledge 
domain on this one, but I'll try to give an answer.

Yes, be prepared for the fact that not all foreign languages will 
support the concept of spaces between words. I don't know anything about 
Japanese, but I do vaguely remember from high school that, for Chinese 
texts, there are often no spaces between words and the reader's 
knowledge of the language allows him or her to infer the word separations.

However, even without knowing Japanese, we might be able to help you 
find acceptable solutions. What is your program supposed to do?
