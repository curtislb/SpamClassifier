This message happens because some value was undef instead of a string.
>From the message, it seems likely that it's a variable being
interpolated into a string. Once you find out which variable, and why
it's undef, and that it doesn't matter whether it's undef or an empty
string, you could fix it something like this:

    # avoid messages about uninitialized $whatever
    $whatever = "" unless defined $whatever;

The first two are great. The third one is not intended for production
code; you should 'use diagnostics' only when you're developing code
and expecting error messages. I say this in part because 'diagnostics'
has a significant overhead of both time and memory. Be sure to disable
it when your code goes into production.

Don't we all?
