An anonymous reader writes "German researchers at the [0]Frauenhofer
Institute said Wednesday that they were launching an [1]attempt to
reassemble millions of shredded East German secret police files using
complicated computerized algorithms. The files were shredded as the
Berlin Wall fell in 1989 and it became clear that the East German regime
was finished. Panicking officials of the Stasi secret police attempted to
destroy the vast volumes of material they had kept on everyone from their
own citizens to foreign leaders."

Dieppe writes "A simple [0]chip added to a DVD disk could prevent retail
theft. According to the AP article at MSNBC, the chip would be activated
at the register to make a previously dark area of the DVD clear, and
therefore readable. Could this help to stem the tide of the approximate
$400 million dollars in losses from brick and mortar stores? Game console
DVDs could also be protected this way too. Could this help to bring the
prices down on DVD games and movies?"

[0]ramboando writes "In an effort to spur adoption of Solaris, Sun
Microsystems has [1]begun a project code-named Indiana to try to give its
operating system some of Linux's success. Sun has been trying for years
to restore the luster of Solaris, but that since has faced a strong
challenge chiefly from Linux. Sun wants to embrace some Linux elements so
"we make Solaris a better Linux than Linux," said Ian Murdock, Sun's
chief operating systems officer, quoting Netscape co-founder Marc
Andreessen, whose latest start-up, Ning, uses Solaris. But it's a tricky
balance to adopt elements of Linux while preserving Solaris technology
and advantages such as the promise of backward compatibility. "As we make
Solaris more familiar to Linux users, we don't [want to] lose what makes
it more compelling and competitive.""

Jessamine writes "A Harvard professor argues that [0]too much information
is being retained by computers, and the machines need to learn how to
forget things as humans always have. "If whatever we do can be held
against us years later, if all our impulsive comments are preserved, they
can easily be combined into a composite picture of ourselves," he writes
in the paper. "Afraid how our words and actions may be perceived years
later and taken out of context, the lack of forgetting may prompt us to
speak less freely and openly." Will such massive databases make us all
act like politicians? Is data retention creating a "panopticon"? These
are questions that the good doctor raises."

[0]tgbrittai asks: "According to Paul Boutin they are merely [1]an

[2]they are pimps. I've known my share of good and bad sysadmins,
programmers and every other professional role out there, and I have to
wonder: are sysadmins really THAT bad?" Most times sys-admins are
overworked and underpaid and have to deal with users who take advantage
of their local IT person, tasking them to fix systems that they callously
break. Others are truly worth the name "Bastard Operators from Hell". How
would you rate your sys-admin and what things did you have to do to make
things run smoothly (or not)?

pilsner.urquell points out a story in the Village Voice from a

giant is [0]now eager to data-mine visitors to its Web properties. Of
course anybody with a site who profits from advertising is likely to be
doing something of the sort. It's just a bit surprising that the Times
would use the words "data mining" out loud in public. From the article:
"Barely a year after their reporters won a Pulitzer prize for exposing
data mining of ordinary citizens by a government spy agency, New York
Times officials had some exciting news for stockholders last week: The
Times company plans to do its own data mining of ordinary citizens, in
the name of online profits... [T]he problem with reading papers
electronically is that they can also read you."

[0]theodp writes "Amazon will [1]pay an undisclosed amount to IBM to
settle a long-running patent feud, and the two companies have agreed to a
long-term patent cross-licensing agreement. Information Week [2]wonders
if an insurance dispute prompted Amazon's settlement, noting that
Atlantic Mutual sued Amazon back in March to escape any obligation to
reimburse the e-tailer should it lose the case brought by IBM. Amazon had
[3]relied on Atlantic Mutual's backing in an earlier legal battle it
[4]waged against tiny InTouch. 'Amazon, whose chief executive, Jeff
Bezos, is a vocal advocate of patent reform, has had numerous patent
issues in the past. In 2005, the technology used in its 1-Click checkout
system came under scrutiny as potentially infringing upon a similar
product made by a small Virginia-based company called IPXL Holdings.
Meanwhile, the US patent system itself is experiencing growing pains as
Congress continues to explore the possibility of updating it to better
serve the needs of the 21st-century business world.'"

surfingmarmot writes "An HBO executive has figured out [0]the problem
with DRM acceptance — it's the name. HBO's chief technology officer Bob
Zitter now wants to refer to the technology as Digital Consumer
Enablement. Because, you see, DRM actually helps consumers by getting
more content into their hands. The company already has HD movies on
demand ready to go, but is delaying them because of ownership concerns.
Says Zitter, 'Digital Consumer Enablement would more accurately describe
technology that allows consumers "to use content in ways they haven't
before," such as enjoying TV shows and movies on portable video players
like iPods. "I don't want to use the term DRM any longer," said Zitter,
who added that content-protection technology could enable various new
applications for cable operators.'"

[0]Romer!can writes "C|Net Editor Michael Kanellos offers a
[1]potentially contentious opinion piece about patents and copyright on
the CNet site. Highlights of the fairly biased piece include: a cheap
shot dismissing open source projects as existing only to act as a foil
for Microsoft, blatantly equating copyright infringement with stealing,
and an embarrassing failure to even casually mention the current term
lengths of patents and copyrights as a driving factor behind popular
dissatisfaction. Instead, he wades through obscure humor and emotional
appeals characterizing patent trolls as the guy next door. 'Nearly every
so-called [patent] troll turned out to have a somewhat persuasive story.
Intellectual Ventures, a patent firm started by former Microsoft chief
scientist Nathan Myhrvold, was staffed with fairly renowned scientists
who didn't fit the profile of people trying to make a quick buck in
court. Another man, criticized as one of the most litigious people in the
U.S., had a great explanation for his behavior. He had only sued people
who had signed--and then violated--nondisclosure agreements. '"

[0]Jenny writes "In the light of the recent QuickTime vulnerability,
revealed for $10,000 spot cash, the UK IT Security Journalist of the Year
asks [1]why business treats security research like a big money TV game
show. 'There can be no doubt that any kind of public vulnerability
research effort will have the opportunity to turn sour, both for the
company promoting it and the users of whatever software or service finds
itself exposed to attack without any chance to defend itself. Throw a
financial reward into the mix and the lure of the hunt, the scent of
blood, is going to be too much for all but the most responsible of
hackers. There really is no incentive to report their findings to the
vulnerable company, and plenty not to. Which is why, especially in the IT
security business, there needs to be a code of conduct with regard to
responsible disclosure.' Do you think there's any truth to this? Or is it
a better idea to find the vulnerabilities as fast as possible, damn the
consequences?"

found a way around the current patent issues they have been facing with
Verizon and others. They are applying technological solutions to a legal
problem, changing the way that Vonage's communications software operates
at a basic level to ensure that they no longer infringe on patent claims.
'Vonage's new technology can be installed through software downloads and

appeal the court decision that requires it to pay Verizon damages for
infringing patents on technology that translates Internet-based calls to
standard lines.'"

An anonymous reader writes "Purdue researchers say they have made [0]a
major advance in the design of the internal combustion engine, one that
could seriously boost fuel efficiency and cut emissions. A key portion
involves building intake and exhaust valves that are no longer driven by
mechanisms connected to the pistons, a departure from the way car engines
have worked since they were commercialized more than a century ago. 'The
concept, known as variable valve actuation, would enable significant
improvements in conventional gasoline and diesel engines used in cars and
trucks and for applications such as generators, he said. The technique
also enables the introduction of an advanced method called homogeneous
charge compression ignition, or HCCI, which would allow the United States
to drastically reduce its dependence on foreign oil and the production of
harmful exhaust emissions. The homogeneous charge compression ignition
technique would make it possible to improve the efficiency of gasoline
engines by 15 percent to 20 percent, making them as efficient as diesel
engines while nearly eliminating smog-generating nitrogen oxides, Shaver
said.'"

[0]they may have finally found dark matter using the Hubble telescope.
We've [1]discussed the stuff a few times in the last year, with the
Hubble actually [2]mapping out the dark matter in the universe in
January. This, though, may be our first 'sighting' of the elusive
substance. "NASA will hold a media teleconference at 1 p.m. EDT on May 15
to discuss the strongest evidence to date that dark matter exists. This
evidence was found in a ghostly ring of dark matter in the cluster
CL0024+17, discovered using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. The ring is
the first detection of dark matter with a unique structure different from
the distribution of both the galaxies and the hot gas in the cluster. The
discovery will be featured in the June 20 issue of the Astrophysical
Journal."
