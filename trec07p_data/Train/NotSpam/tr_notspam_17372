Well, most of the other files are FSF copyrighted, and FSFE told me that FSF 
always sticks to the letter of the license (logical) so I haven't tried to 
contact the other users.

I could have gone on with the current situation because no one has filed a 
formal complaint.  However, I *much* prefer to be in compliance and not to 
violate anyone's copyright.

This is apparently possible because GNUTLS seems to have an OpenSSL 
compatiblity layer.  However, this is not something that I can personally 
look at in the very near future.

In addition, over time, I will remove *all* code that is not copyrighted with 
the "Bacula" license, but that will probably take even longer to fix.

I don't know.  One possibility is that I misunderstood them. My understanding 
is that it all has to do with distribution. If one does not distribute GPLed 
binaries mixed with non-GPLed code and one's distributed binaries use only 
shared objects that are on the user's system, there is no problem. This is in 
fact what happens with glibc and many other libraries, which are not 
*required* to run a system, but are on the system. That is my understanding. 

In any case, that is how I am going to interprete it until someone threatens 
me, and if that happens, which I doubt, the project will simply stop 
releasing binaries that can run with OpenSSL, and hopefully by then everyone 
will have switchted to GPL v3 where this stupid problem does not exist.  I 
don't imagine that is a solution for Debian though.
