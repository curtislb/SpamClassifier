McCain suggests immigration deal will help fight war on terror

ATLANTA (CNN) -- On the campaign trail Thursday in New York City, Sen. John McCain cited the alleged Fort Dix terror
plot in defending the immigration deal worked out earlier in the day.

"The Fort Dix situation indicated when you have people who have been here a long time illegally and try to kill
Americans, indicates we've got to account for these people who are in the country illegally," the Arizona senator, who
is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, said outside a fundraiser.

McCain has come under fire from some conservatives for his stance on immigration -- which is in line with President
Bush's goal.

Political Hot Topics
(Today's top political stories from news organizations across the country)

"DELICATE COMPROMISE" REACHED ON IMMIGRATION: The Bush administration and a bipartisan group of senators reached
agreement yesterday on a sprawling overhaul of the nation's immigration laws that would bring an estimated 12 million
illegal immigrants out of society's shadows while stiffening border protections and cracking down on employers of
undocumented workers. The delicate compromise, 380 pages long and three months in the making, represents perhaps the
last opportunity for President Bush to win a major legislative accomplishment for his second term, and it could become
the most significant revision of the nation's immigration system in 41 years. Bush hailed the agreement as "one that
will help enforce our borders, but equally importantly, it will treat people with respect." Washington Post: Deal on
Immigration Reached http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/17/AR2007051700253.html

NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE PLANNED ON GONZALES: Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales's standing in Congress weakened further on
Thursday as Senate Democrats arranged to hold a no-confidence vote and the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary
Committee predicted that the furor over Mr. Gonzales's stewardship would end with his resignation. Mr. Gonzales's
already shaky position eroded after reports this week about an episode in 2004 when as White House counsel he was
involved in an apparent effort to circumvent Justice Department officials who had refused to renew authority for a
secret domestic eavesdropping program. And Thursday, The Washington Post identified several United States attorneys who
appeared on various Justice Department lists in 2005 and 2006 as potential candidates for dismissal. New York Times:
Senate Democrats Plan a Resolution on Gonzales http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/18/washington/18gonzales.html

WOLFOWITZ TO RESIGN: Paul Wolfowitz, a prominent conservative and an architect of the Iraq war, resigned as president
of the World Bank on Thursday as the result of a scandal in which he had arranged a huge pay increase for his
girlfriend. Wolfowitz, 63, said he will step down at the end of June. His resignation will touch off a search for a new
president by the board's executive directors. Established in 1944, the World Bank has traditionally been headed by an
American. But that could change. Even the name of British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who is leaving office next month,
has been floated in some quarters. Chicago Tribune: Wolfowitz out as World Bank chief

STANDING WITH BUSH, BLAIR SAYS ALLIANCE ON IRAQ WAS THE "RIGHT DECISION": President Bush yesterday said the fight
against radical Islam demands "courage," as Tony Blair, standing in the White House Rose Garden for his final time as
British prime minister, said he has "never doubted" tying his fate to the vagaries of the U.S.-led war in Iraq. In an
occasionally nostalgic press conference that featured each leader praising the other for his steadfast resolve, Mr.
Blair said that even though his term in office is being cut short by the unpopular war, he still would choose to commit
British forces to the worldwide fight against terrorism. "You can debate about the mistakes and the issues and you can
debate about Iraq, whether we should have done this or we should have done that," said the normally cool Mr. Blair,
bristling at a question from a British reporter. "I would take the same position of alliance with America again... I
thought then, and I think now, it was the right decision," he said. Washington Times: Bush, Blair take one last stand

McCAIN MISSED IRAQ VOTES "NOT SITTING WELL" WITH REID: Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) is the only presidential candidate in
Congress to have missed a major vote on the Iraq war this year, and his absences are not sitting well with Senate
Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.). Liz Oxhorn, a spokeswoman for Reid, told The Hill, "Sen. McCain has spent
considerable time defending the president on Iraq and catering to the Republican base on immigration, but has only
managed to show up for four of the last 14 Iraq votes and parachute into [yesterday's] immigration press conference at
the last minute. Who is the real John McCain?" McCain's campaign quickly counterattacked. The Hill: McCain's missed
votes on Iraq trigger Reid rebuke

ROVE-CHENEY-LIBBY LAWYERS SAY PLAME SUIT SHOULD BE DISMISSED: Attorneys for Vice President Cheney and top White House
officials told a federal judge yesterday that they cannot be held liable for anything they disclosed to reporters about
covert CIA officer Valerie Plame or her husband, former ambassador Joseph C. Wilson IV. The officials, who include
senior White House adviser Karl Rove and Cheney's former chief of staff, I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby, argued that the
judge should dismiss a lawsuit filed by the couple that stemmed from the disclosure of Plame's identity to the media.
The suit claims that Cheney, Libby, Rove and former deputy secretary of state Richard L. Armitage violated the couple's
privacy and constitutional rights by publicly revealing Plame's identity in an effort to retaliate against Wilson.

MEMBERS SPEND MILLIONS TO DEFEND THEMSELVES IN CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS: Two dozen current and former members of
Congress caught up in criminal investigations or ethics inquiries spent more than $5 million in campaign funds on legal
fees during the last 27 months covered by campaign-finance records. The spending reflects a spate of scandals that were
a factor in the Democratic takeover of Congress last year and, for some lawmakers, remain a problem. Eight current
members have been publicly identified as being under investigation. While campaign donations may not be spent for
personal use, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) has ruled that fighting to stay out of jail is a legitimate
political activity as long as the allegations of wrongdoing relate to conduct in office. USA Today: Campaign funds
going to legal fees http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20070518/1a_bottomstrip18.art.htm

SOME OF THE TOUGHEST LOBBYING REFORMS "LEFT ON THE CUTTING ROOM FLOOR": House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pledged last fall
that a new Democratic majority would "drain the swamp" in Congress by breaking the link between lawmakers and
lobbyists. But as she now tries to pass lobbying reforms, she's facing strong resistance from a surprising corner --
her veteran Democratic colleagues. The House Judiciary Committee passed new ethics legislation Thursday, but only after
several days of backroom deal-making where some of the toughest proposed reforms were left on the cutting-room floor.
At a Democratic caucus meeting Tuesday, several longtime lawmakers objected to the effort to force lobbyists to
disclose when they "bundled" campaign checks, which they argued would make it harder to raise money. San Francisco
Chronicle: House panel OKs ethics bill weakened by veteran Democrats

REP. ROGERS WILL SEEK REPRIMAND OF REP. MURTHA: Rep. John P. Murtha (D-Pa.) threatened to deny any further spending
projects to a Republican who challenged him over an earmark, his antagonist has charged -- a potential violation of
House rules. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) had challenged money that Murtha inserted into an intelligence bill last week.
Rogers turned the tables later that night by saying he would propose a reprimand of Murtha for violating House rules.
The Republican is planning to insert a transcript of their exchange in the Congressional Record to document the
potential violation. The privileged resolution will also require a House vote to reprimand Murtha for his comments,
according to a copy received by Politico. The Politico: Murtha accused of rules violation

TOUGH CANDIDATE CHOICE FOR BLACK LEADERS: The large number of well-known Democratic candidates has further complicated
the quadrennial choice faced by elected officials [in South Carolina] as they size up the presidential field. The
dilemma is particularly pointed for black elected officials such as [State Rep. Robert] Ford, who are faced with a
field that includes three candidates -- Edwards, Clinton and Obama -- with strong claims on African American voters.
The black vote is projected to account for half of the Democratic electorate in South Carolina's January primary,
raising the stakes for candidates trying to win support from black leaders. In Florida, which has moved its primary up
to Jan. 29, black voters are nearly a quarter of the Democratic electorate. Washington Post: Can Old Loyalties Trump
Racial Solidarity? http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/17/AR2007051702594.html

OBAMA RIPS HILLARY ON IRAQ: Barack Obama flashed his fangs yesterday as he tore into rival Hillary Rodham Clinton over
her pinwheeling position on the Iraq war - the first time the Illinois senator has shredded the Democratic
front-runner. Obama, who has hyped his 2002 opposition to the Iraq invasion, ripped the former first lady after being
asked on MSNBC about her husband, Bill Clinton's, recent remark that Obama's "voting record and Hillary's are almost
identical, I think, on all the relevant issues." "I suppose that's true if you leave out the fact that she authorized
it and supported it, and I said it was a bad idea," Obama shot back. "That's a fairly major difference." He stayed on
the attack by accusing Bill and Hillary Clinton of trying to blur her transition from an Iraq hawk to one of the war's
most vocal critics. New York Post: OBAMA OPENS FIRE ON HILL'S WAR VOTE http://www.nypost.com/

MICHELLE OBAMA'S "STARRING ROLE": It was a triumphant moment for Barack Obama: He was walking through the Capitol for
the very first time as a United States senator in January 2005, trailed by photographers, hangers-on, and finally, his
amused wife. Rolling her eyes as she pulled a reporter aside, Michelle Obama said, "Maybe one day, he will do something
to warrant all this attention." Two years and one presidential announcement later, the sarcasm is gone, and a woman who
has said she dislikes politics is assuming a starring role in her husband's campaign for the White House. New York
Times: Michelle Obama Adds New Role to Balancing Act http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/18/us/politics/18michelle.html

DOBSON WOULD RATHER NOT VOTE AT ALL THAN VOTE FOR RUDY GIULIANI: A prominent Christian leader said Thursday that "my
conscience and my moral convictions" prevent him from voting for Rudy Giuliani should he win the Republican nomination.
In a blistering online column, Focus on the Family founder James Dobson wrote that, should the former New York mayor
become the nominee, "I will either cast my ballot for an also-ran - or if worse comes to worst - not vote in a
presidential election for the first time in my adult life." "Many liberal Americans will agree with the social
positions espoused by Giuliani. However, I don't believe conservative voters whose support he seeks will be impressed,"
Dobson said on WorldNetDaily, a conservative news Web site. AP via Yahoo! News: Dobson says he won't vote for Giuliani
http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070518/ap_on_el_pr/giuliani_dobson

GIULIANI, EDWARDS UNAWARE OF SUDAN CONNECTIONS IN PORTFOLIOS: Presidential candidates Rudy Giuliani and John Edwards,
who have spoken out about genocide in Darfur, did not know their financial holdings included investments in companies
that do business in Sudan, aides said Thursday. An Edwards campaign spokesman said the former Democratic senator from
North Carolina would sell thousands of dollars of Sudan-related funds. "He did not know about it and will divest," Eric
Schultz said following inquiries about Edwards' portfolio. Giuliani, the Republican former mayor of New York, has at
least one investment of between $500,000 and $1 million in a fund that holds stock in a company that is active in
Sudan. "The mayor was unaware of this connection, but is taking it very seriously," spokeswoman Maria Comella said. AP
via Yahoo! News: Giuliani, Edwards have Sudan holdings http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070518/ap_on_el_pr/candidates_sudan


JUDI GETS A "TIDY SUM" FOR SPEECHWRITING: Being Mrs. Rudy Giuliani can't be easy, but at least it pays well - about
$10,000 a month. A day after the former mayor disclosed in federal filings that he considers his third wife, Judith, a
salaried employee, sources said he has paid her about $125,000 a year for speechwriting help - since before they were
married. The tidy sums, which the couple have always reported as income on their joint tax returns, was for
speech-writing help and the many days Judith spent traveling with her husband to paid engagements around the globe.
"Mrs. Giuliani made a professional contribution and the mayor recognizes and respects her efforts," one aide said. "He
is merely acknowledging both her time commitment and her professional value." New York Post: In Rudy's heart & on
payroll http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2007/05/18/2007-05-18_in_rudys_heart__on_payroll-2.html

CANDIDATES TALK UP THEIR UNION CREDENTIALS: Democrats looking to boost their 2008 presidential hopes wooed thousands of
union members on the National Mall Thursday, promising to reverse what they called a long-standing anti-labor stance by
President Bush. "I'm ready to be the person who puts labor's flag right on the White House's lawn," said Rep. Dennis
Kucinich, D-Ohio, one of several Democratic candidates who took the stage at the International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers-sponsored rally. Kucinich, along with Sens. Joe Biden of Delaware and Hillary Clinton
of New York, talked up their union credentials to the blue-shirted activists who gathered a couple of blocks away from
the Capitol. "Are you ready for a president who is actively pro-labor and is going to appoint people who actually care
about workers rights?" Clinton asked the crowd. AP via Yahoo! News: Dem candidates woo union members on Mall
