Most of the time the policy is enacted by lower-case-l lazy sysadmins
who can't be bothered to type

perl -MCPAN -e install Foo::Bar

My normal route around them is to install the module into the home
directory of the user who is going to run the script, but I have had
difficulty with this before when it comes time to move to production:
"Where is the code review for that code?".  My answer of "where is the
code review for that (often open source) database install you just
did?" doesn't tend to hold the weight I wish it did.  For some reason
binary blobs make some types of sysadmins feel all fuzzy and warm
inside.

As to whether a bare bones Perl distribution would help or hinder the
process of getting people to accept modules, well, all I can say is
that it is hard enough to get Perl into some companies.  If I had to
tell them "Oh, and we have to install all of these modules before we
can start coding." their response would likely be "Java already can do
that.  Use it instead.".  Yes, I have been told that before (related
to some XML stuff).
