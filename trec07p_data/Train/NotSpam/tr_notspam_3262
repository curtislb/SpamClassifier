The i686 kernels are optimized for the newer processors, but the 386
kernels will work, too. I think for now you should not worry about this.
Once everything else is fixed you can change to an i686 kernel.

So here is your problem: You did an incomplete upgrade from Sarge to
Etch. This is also obvious from the /etc/apt/sources.list which you
posted in your other recent message. The most important thing is to
upgrade your kernel to version 2.6.18. Somebody else had a similar issue
very recently; please see here for details:

http://lists.debian.org/debian-laptop/2007/04/msg00089.html

Also note that the upgrade instructions are available in a number of
languages (including Italian):

http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/releasenotes

(Make sure that you use one from the "Intel x86" row.)

Completing the upgrade procedure should get your system running again.
Report back if anything should go wrong.
