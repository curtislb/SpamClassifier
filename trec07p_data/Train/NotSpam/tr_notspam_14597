						Two Shags' replacement? Well whoop-de-doo. Deprived of a leadership c=
ontest...the TV news people lined up a load of people we've never heard of =
and couldn't care less about...presumably to see who'd be best placed for a=
 role that has no actual, er, role. <a href=3D"http://captainblue.livejourn=

That was one view on the blogs this morning of Newsnight's Labour deputy le=
adership debate, but I must say it was very much in the minority. We'd deba=
ted among ourselves how much interest there'd be in a deputy leadership deb=
ate. Would an unmanageably large line-up of six contenders simply agree to =
agree on the key issues, the loser being the viewer?
<br>

<br>
But then we invited you to let us know questions you'd like Jeremy to ask, =
and hundreds of you obliged which you can <a href=3D"http://www.bbc.co.uk/b=
logs/newsnight/2007/05/deputy_leadership_hopefuls_on_newsnight.html"><b>rea=
d here</b></a>. Thousands have already taken part in the post-match vote <a=
 href=3D"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/default.stm"><b>(c=
lick here to vote)</b></a> and a healthy audience of more than a million wa=
tched the late-night debate from beginning to end <a href=3D"http://news.bb=

Could it be that the slightly unglamorous Labour deputy leadership debate i=
s re-engaging the public's interest in politics?
