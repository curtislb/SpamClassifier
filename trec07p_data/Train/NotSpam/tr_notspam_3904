When you're booting up, I think you can use the rate keys.  When installing FC6 or booting up with the GRML CD, I often changed the rate, volume, and two punctuation levels right after I heard "LiteTalk found."  When the system's installed, I put my settings in /etc/rc.local.  I hope this helps, and apologize if I miss what the problem is you're trying to solve.

> Hi, One thing I have found is it is not possible to type for example at
