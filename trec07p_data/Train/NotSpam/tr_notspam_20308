Whoops, I forgot the intro on this.

This is my progress thus far with extracting licenses from various
formats.    Jamie, I'm curious on your thoughts on adding new extractors
(besides the ones mentioned below, GIF is another I have in mind.  I'm
not sure whether or not it's worthwhile, however).  I don't want to be
adding bloat...

Cheers,
Jason
