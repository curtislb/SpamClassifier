HEADLINES
IRAQ FUNDING TALKS HIT STALEMATE
Hopes for reaching a compromise bill to keep funding the Iraq war collapsed today when Democratic leaders emerged from a meeting with Republican and White House officials -- and each side blamed the other for the breakdown in negotiations. "To say I was dsappointed in the meeting is an understatement," Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid told reporters after the session. "I expected the president would accept some accountability for what we're trying to accomplish." House Minority Leader John Boehner, meanwhile, told reporters he was also disappointed.  "Our colleagues across the aisle continue to insist on having surrender dates in the supplemental spending bill.  We continue to believe that the generals on the ground ought to be making decisions about how best to wage the war in Iraq, not Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid." Pelosi, the House speaker, said Democrats will return to a conference committee of both Houses to seek another compromise proposal. The supplemental funding wo!
 uld include more than $90 billion for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan -- mostly Iraq.  The amount of money is not the source of dispute.  Democrats are pushing for the bill to contain concrete goals for the Iraqi government to meet. Democrats have also pressed for a scheduled pullout of American troops, an idea the White House rejects.

BIPARTISAN IMMIGRATION DEAL FACES BIPARTISAN BATTLE
Less than a day after a bipartisan group of senators announced a compromise bill aimed at tackling one of the most controversial issues on the docket, it became increasingly clear the immigration proposal will face tough opposition from both sides of the aisle. The bill would offer the estimated 12 million undocumented immigrants a path to United States citizenship. Some conservatives oppose what they call "amnesty" for illegal behavior, while some liberals call it unfair for limiting opportunities for unskilled workers.  Lawmakers and interest groups alike quickly issued statements laying out their positions. "Basically, when you give somebody benefits, when you give them a pathway to citizenship, when you allow them, starting January 1st, to stay here illegally, when you allow them to work here, that is amnesty. It's nothing but amnesty," Rep. Ed Royce (R-Calif.) told CNN. Senators who helped draft the agreement pressed for support, arguing that the issue has long ended in!
  a congressional stalemate. Republican Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona said the agreement isn't perfect, "but it represents the best opportunity that we have, in a bipartisan way, to do something about this problem." President Bush described the agreement as "one that will help enforce our borders but, equally importantly, it will treat people with respect."  He said people covered by the legislation would "be treated without amnesty but without animosity." The 380-page bill, which follows almost three months of negotiations, would give immediate work authorization to undocumented workers who arrived in the United States before January 1, 2007. Heads of households would have to return to their home countries within eight years, and they would be guaranteed the right to return. Applicants would also have to pay a $5,000 penalty. The number of Border Patrol agents would be increased, 370 miles of border fencing would be built and the rest would be strengthened, and employers who hire!
  undocumented workers would face fines. After the provisions a!
 re in pl
ace, a guest-worker program would be initiated, under which 400,000 temporary workers per year would be granted two-year "Y" visas which would require them to return home for a year, then allow them to re-enter for another two years.  That process could be repeated twice.

NEW AIRSTRIKES, NEW DEATHS IN GAZA
Israel launched more airstrikes against Hamas targets in Gaza today -- one day after the Israeli military began targeting the militant group in retaliation for dozens of Qassam rockets fired from Gaza into Israel over the last several days, Israel Defense Forces said. Three Palestinian militants were killed and four injured today in an airstrike on a car in the Sheikh Radwan area of Gaza City, Palestinian security sources said. The IDF confirmed the airstrike, saying it was targeting a car carrying Hamas militants and weaponry. That brings to 14 the number of Palestinians killed in Israeli military airstrikes yesterday and today, according to Palestinian security and medical sources. The Israelis said Qassam rockets launched from Gaza hit a school and a synagogue in Sderot, near Israel's border with Gaza. Two other rockets hit a home and nearly hit a gas station, the military said. Officials said more than 90 rockets from Gaza have landed in Israel since Tuesday. Internal Pa!
 lestinian violence between Hamas and Fatah flared again today when witnesses reported seeing the Fatah-affiliated Presidential Guard firing rockets at Islamic University -- considered a Hamas stronghold. The Islamic militant group Hamas defeated Abbas' Fatah party in the January election. Despite this, the factional fighting was quieter today than two days ago. Residents of the Jabiliya refugee camp marched in the streets to show their opposition to the sectarian fighting.

ARRESTS MADE IN GRUESOME IRAQI “HONOR” KILLING
Authorities in northern Iraq arrested four people in connection with the so-called "honor killing" last month of a Kurdish teen -- a startling, morbid pummeling caught on a mobile phone video camera and aired on TV across on the world. Two of the four arrested are members of the victim's family, police in Nineveh province said. Four others, including a cousin thought to have instigated the killing, are being sought. The case portrays the tragedy and brutality of "honor killings" in the Muslim world. That's where family members kill relatives, almost always female, because their actions shame a family. Dozens of honor killings are reported in Iraq every year. The practice has been condemned around the world by governments and human rights groups. A yearly vigil protesting honor killings is held in London. In this case, Dua Khalil, a 17-year-old Kurdish girl whose religion is Yazidi, was dragged into a crowd with police looking on and kicked, beaten and stoned to death last mo!
 nth. Authorities believe she was killed for being seen with a Sunni Muslim man. The Yazidis, who observe an ancient Middle Eastern religion, looks down on mixing with people of another faith. CNN played images from the video. The killing is said to have spurred the killings of about two dozen Yazidi men by Sunni Muslims in the Mosul area two weeks later. The violence ratcheted up tensions between Yazidis and Muslims in Bashiqa, the largely Yazidi city in Nineveh province where the victim is from. Provincial officials don't think much could have been done to stop the killing, but at least three officers are being investigated and could be fired.

RISING GAS PRICES HIT CONSUMERS
A new survey by the National Retail Federation said rising gasoline prices are a growing worry for both consumers and retailers as the daily reading on gas prices from AAA shows gasoline prices hitting a record high for the sixth straight day today. The motorist group says the average price for a gallon of self-serve unleaded gasoline was $3.129 in its latest reading, which is based on a daily survey of purchases at up to 85,000 gas stations. That's up from yesterday’s record of $3.114. The group warned in congressional testimony this week it believes that more record-high prices could be on the way. It is forecasting prices are likely to approach $3.25 a gallon during the next 60 days. The run-up in prices is a big concern for retailers, according to their trade group. Its survey of consumers released today found average consumer believes that the price of gas will reach $3.32 per gallon by Father's Day. As a result, 40.2% of consumers are taking fewer shopping trips, while!
  37.9% told the survey they plan to shop closer to home. In addition, 30.7 % said they are shopping for sales more often and 23.5% are using more coupons. Perhaps of greatest concern to the retailers, 24.1% said they are  spending less on clothing, while only one in five have delayed major purchases, such as a car, television or furniture and 31.1% are dining out less.
