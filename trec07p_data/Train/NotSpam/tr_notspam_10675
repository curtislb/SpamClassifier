I tried the ubuntu live cd, and was considering putting it on a system
to really play with, but this announcement has changed my mind. I
first tried gnome with gnopernicus back in 2002, and was very, very
impressed with what I saw when using the livecd with orca recently. Even though
great progress was made, I found that the gui access as it
stands now, still leaves much to be desired.

As for rolling my own kernel, I would usually do that on a system I
decided to keep installed, but not on a system I am just playing with.
