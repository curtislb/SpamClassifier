3:50 PM, 6/10/07, Update: Atlantis docks with space station=20

Commander Rick Sturckow guided the shuttle Atlantis to a picture-perfect do=
cking with the international space station today after a dramatic end-over-=
end flip across the heart of South America to let the station crew photogra=
ph the shuttle's fragile heat shield.

Using a joystick on the shuttle's aft flight deck, Sturckow deftly closed o=
ut a trouble-free two-day rendezvous with a gentle docking at 3:36 p.m. as =
the two spacecraft sailed high above the east coast of Australia northeast =
of Sydney.

"ISS and Houston, from Atlantis. Capture confirmed," a shuttle astronaut ra=
dioed as the docking systems engaged. A few minutes later, hooks and latche=
s were activated to firmly pull the two spacecraft together. After leak che=
cks to make sure the interface is airtight, hatches will be opened and the =
station crew will welcome their shuttle colleagues aboard.

Running three months late because of hail damage to the shuttle's external =
fuel tank, Atlantis brought two welcome additions to the international lab =
complex: A $367 million set of solar panels and a fresh crew member - Clay =
Anderson - to replace outgoing station flier Sunita Williams.

Launched to the outpost last December aboard shuttle Discovery, Williams wi=
ll set a new space endurance record for female astronauts and cosmonauts wh=
en she lands aboard Atlantis June 19 after 192 days off planet.

"Great job today, Atlantis, on the rendezvous," astronaut Terry Virts radio=
ed from mission control. "Very nice approach. And welcome to your new home,=
 Clay."

"Thanks a lot, Houston," Sturckow replied.

Today's rendezvous and docking included a now-routine but nonetheless spect=
acular rotational pitch maneuver, or RPM, a key element in NASA's post-Colu=
mbia focus on assessing the health of the orbiter's heat shield before a cr=
ew commits to re-entry.

Spectacular video beamed down from the space station showed Atlantis perfor=
ming a graceful pirouette 600 feet directly below the laboratory, a slow-mo=
tion back flip against the backdrop of the Brazilian rain forest racing pas=
t 220 miles below.

There were no obvious signs of anything unusual, but engineers will have to=
 wait for station commander Fyodor Yurchikhin and flight engineer Oleg Koto=
v to downlink zoomed-in digital photographs to get the clarity needed for a=
 thorough assessment.

After completing the pitch maneuver, Sturckow piloted Atlantis in a slow lo=
op up to a point about 300 feet directly in front of the station with the s=
huttle's nose pointing toward deep space and its open payload bay toward a =
docking port on the front of the Destiny laboratory module.

=46rom there, he flew the shuttle straight in for docking.

On most flights, rendezvous and docking would be the highlight of a busy da=
y in space. But for Atlantis' crew, docking kicked off an equally busy afte=
rnoon of work to pull the 36,000-pound S3/S4 solar array truss segment from=
 the shuttle's cargo bay so it can be handed off to the station's robot arm=
 and safely "parked" overnight.

The massive segment will be attached to the right side of the station's mai=
n power truss on Monday just before the start of a spacewalk by Jim Reilly =
and Danny Olivas to make critical electrical connections and prepare the ne=
w arrays for deployment Tuesday. Once extended, the panels will stretch 240=
 feet from tip to tip.

An identical set of arrays was attached to the left side of the main power =
truss last September. The new arrays, and the relocation of a third set of =
solar panels later this year, are required to generate the power needed to =
support the long-awaited delivery of European and Japanese research modules=
 late this year and early next.

Atlantis' crew plans spacewalks Monday, Wednesday and Friday to complete th=
e outfitting and activation of the new S3/S4 solar array segment and to per=
form a variety of other assembly tasks. They also will assist, if necessary=
, work to retract the P6-2B solar panel so the arrays can be moved to the l=
eft end of the power truss later this year.

One wild card in the crew's flight plan is what, if anything, NASA managers=
 might decide to do about a pulled-up insulation blanket on the upper secti=
on of Atlantis' left-side Orbital Maneuvering System rocket pod. Engineers =
have not yet completed their assessment of the blanket or what techniques s=
pacewalking astronauts might employ to address the problem.
