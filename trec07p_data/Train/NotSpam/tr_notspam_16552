10:30 AM, 6/5/07, Update: Start of countdown on tap; launch forecast 70 per=
cent 'go'=20

Shuttle engineers are gearing up today for the start of the shuttle Atlanti=
s' countdown to blastoff Friday on a mission to deliver a new set of solar =
arrays to the international space station. With forecasters predicting a 70=
 percent chance of good weather, the countdown is scheduled to start at 9 p=
.m. this evening, targeting a launch attempt at 7:38:02 p.m. Friday.

"All our systems right now are in great shape, we're tracking no constraint=
s that are show stoppers," said NASA Test Director Steve Payne. "The teams =
are ready and everybody's eager to launch. We're looking forward to a safe =
and successful assembly mission."

Shuttle weather officer Kathy Winters said today she expects a 70 percent c=
hance of acceptable weather Friday, Saturday and Sunday, with the only conc=
ern being possible showers or thunderstorms in the area. The weather at eme=
rgency runways in California, Spain and France also is expected to be good.

"We do expect to see some afternoon thunderstorms in the area on launch day=
 but by launch time, all that weather should move inland with the sea breez=
e," Winters said. "So for the coast here, the weather looks reasonably prom=
ising for launch."

Atlantis originally was scheduled for liftoff on mission STS-117 on March 1=
5, but the flight was put on hold after a freak hail storm Feb. 26 that cau=
sed extensive damage to the protective insulation on the shuttle's external=
 fuel tank. Repairing the tank was a major technical challenge, but NASA ma=
nagers say they are satisfied the repairs will stand up to the thermal and =
aerodynamic rigors of launch.

"We are relieved that we're finally there," Payne said. "It's been a long w=
aiting period and as you probably know, whenever you're ready to go and you=
 have to stop and wait for a few months, it's a disappointment. But once yo=
u spool back up and everything's ready, and it looks like everything's fall=
ing into place nicely, the team's really excited and we're ready to get off=
 the ground."

A detailed countdown timeline is posted on the CBS News STS-117 Quick-Look =
