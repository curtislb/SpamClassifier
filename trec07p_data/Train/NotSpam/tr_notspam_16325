Which drivers are you using?  Are they the ones that came with the 
archive, or those that came with the Dectalk PC?  The ones that came with 
the archive are for the Dectalk PC 1.  If you have the Dectalk PC 2, they 
won't work.  If in doubt, use the drivers that originally came with the 
card.  They should be on a 3.5-inch disk.  The Dectalk PC 2 is smaller 
than the Dectalk PC 1.
