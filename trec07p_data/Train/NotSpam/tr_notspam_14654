>Hello list,
>My main problem has been solved.
>As some of you know, when I tried to make a firewall rule, I would get locked 
out of my system, and I'd have to iptables -F from the console.
>I had to allow for 139 and 445 to come through.
>just thought I'd share the information. :)
>HTH,
>BTW, I'm using nmap, but it's only getting TCP ports. I'd like to block all po
tential udp threats as well as any other ports running that I don't know about 
that iptables is showing. Anyone have any suggestions?
