Would you be more specific about how you have observed this and what you
mean by Usenet?

I have been using a newsreader to read and post to this group ever since
it was created, because like all the mailing lists hosted on perl.org, it
is bidirectionally gatewayed with the NNTP server at news.perl.org.  But
that server does not, AFAICT, exchange articles with the global network
known as Usenet.  I just added news.perl.org to my pan server list.

A few years ago, Google started picking up the perl.org mailing
lists/newsgroups in Google Groups under the perl.* hierarchy.  I imagine
at that time it became possible to post to them from Google Groups as
well, although I've never tried and have no evidence of it.

I don't see anything 'recent' there.
