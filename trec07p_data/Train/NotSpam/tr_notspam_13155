Hi list,

I own a Toshiba Satellite Pro 2100 with an ALPS Touchpad installed. This
one works almost perfect now, except the seperate wheel between the
buttons does not work anymore. I can choose to use the synaptics driver
to use all touchpad specific features (including scrolling on the right
or bottom edges for vertical and horizontal movement) without the
seperate wheel working, or to use the normal mouse driver, without
tochpad specific features but the wheel works. Somehow annoying.

I played around a bit with the xorg.conf, several device sections,
several orders of them, several options, several devices used
(from /dev/psaux to udev style /dev/input/*, different button statements
(from 5 up to 11), with and without ZAxisMapping, and nothing seems to
work. So either the wheel with driver mouse or with driver "synaptics"
with emulated wheel on the pads edges... not both at the same time. If I
start xev with driver synaptics loaded I even don't get any events for
the wheel.

Any ideas? Any help is appreciated! As a starting point I paste my
touchpad section underneath.

greetings
Michael

P.S.: as a side note, I use sometimes an USB mouse, this mouse works
too, I just neeed to add another device section with /dev/input/mice as
device.
