I'm always open to learning more about this fiddly problem.
FSFE's reasoning for this seems to be:

[Kern's mail]
> I've been in conversation with FSFE, and from what they tell me, the GPL

This seems to contradict oft-repeated views such as:
http://www.openssl.org/support/faq.html#LEGAL2
http://www.gnome.org/~markmc/openssl-and-the-gpl.html

Further, if Bacula uses openssl-specific calls, isn't it a derived work
of openssl?

Finally, does licensing@FSF agree with the FSFE opinion?  Having the
licence author on board would probably strengthen the argument for
including a whole range of plain-GPL+OpenSSL software.

No.  At least we haven't in the past AIUI because OpenSSL is not a
required part of debian installations.  See end of Anthony Towns's
Message-id: <20010616160333.A21471@azure.humbug.org.au>
http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2001/06/msg00043.html

Should we ask bap to add this link to the FAQ?

Can Bacula build against GNUTLS or Mozilla NSS?

Will the copyright holders of other code grant the exception?
Who are they?

(+1 to the 'pain in the neck' comment, by the way.)

Hope that helps,
