Dear Cabot Wealth Advisory Reader,

Today I want to write a bit about objectivity.

Objectivity, ideally, is the ability to perceive the truth through the
examination of observable phenomena while avoiding the influence of
personal emotions and prejudices.

In investing, that means giving all stocks an equal hearing, regardless of
the industry they're in or the location of the company.

For most of us, this is impossible.  Several readers, for example, have
written to me saying they'll never invest in Chinese stocks because they
don't trust the Communist party.

Other investors restrict their investing to industries they know well. 
One of my long-time readers, in fact, has always loved Caterpillar stock,
because the company was one of his biggest customers.

And many investors hang on to the stock of their old employer forever,
perpetuating the dependent role long after the rationale for it is gone. 
Here in Salem, for example, you can find many people who will hold General
Electric stock until the day they die.

Now, sometimes this works out fine.  Over the past forty years, G.E. has
done alright by investors, and today it pays a 3% dividend, which is
appropriate for a lot of those folks.

But in the long run, you can do much better by opening your eyes, and
broadening your horizons.  And the way to do this is to use a totally
objective system.

For us, that's the OptiMo system used by Cabot Top Ten Report.

Here's how it works.  Every Monday morning we arrive in the office to find
a list of ten stocks selected by OptiMo . . . selected solely on the basis
of their performance.

And then we spend the morning researching and writing.  It's no use
saying, "I don't like steel stocks," or "I don't like Brazilian stocks.
Give me another one."  That would defeat the system.

So we research what OptiMo gives us, and as a result, we're on top of all
the market's winners.

A month ago, for example, we wrote up Potash Corp. (POT) when it was
trading at 68.  Now, it's safe to say that there's very little love for
potash in this world, but our research showed us the strong link between
potash and ethanol.  We recommended it, and today it's 78.

Another one that most investors would ignore is Cooper Tire and Rubber
(CTB), which first appeared in Cabot Top Ten on March 5 when it was
trading at 19.  The tire business is old and competitive, and you wouldn't
think there's much to get excited about there.  But after doing the
research, we liked the story so much we named the stock Editor's Choice
for the week.  Today Cooper is at 27, hitting new highs!

And then there's MasterCard.  We all know the company, but not many
investors know the stock, and that's because it just came public in May
2006.  But it popped up in Cabot Top Ten last September, when it was
trading at 65.  We recommended it.  And today it's trading over 150!

Bottom line: Without an objective system that steers you to all the
market's top performers, you're never going to find all these winners. 
And I do want you to be a winner.

So today, I'm offering a special deal to new subscribers who've never
tried Cabot Top Ten Report before.  It's very affordable; in fact, the
profits from just one good investment will likely pay your modest
subscription fee.
