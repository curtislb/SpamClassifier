The DAISY consortium has defined a digital audio book standard, and 
there is an effort to make an open source ODF to DAISY converter, 
complete with text-to-speech generation.  A DAISY book (see 
http://daisy.org) is an XML file containing book structure, and maybe 
audio and maybe full text (and sometimes both).  DAISY books would be an 
excellent way to deliver content, with either human or very high quality 
synthetic speech.  A DAISY book reader that had the full text could 
highlight words as they are spoken in audio, aiding reading 
comprehension.  By the way, NIMAS is a derivative of DAISY, and is the 
emerging digital textbook standard.
