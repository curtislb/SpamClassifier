As in "too much unnecessary typing and commas and such, which don't really

Yes yes. I was making the point that file operations should be tested and 
throw errors when they barf. Which the OP wasn't doing.

another process. Still not sure of your point. I didn't think the OP wanted 
a lecture about file locking.
