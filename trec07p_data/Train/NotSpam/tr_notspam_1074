Hi

Mails which are send by the perl script are usually found in the SPAM or 
JUNK as a result most of the mails are not seen by the recipient. Is 
there any way in the perl script we can set some Magical Header :) by 
which the mail goes to INBOX only. First of all can we do in the perl 
script or is it something I need to do in my Mail server. Please help...

Thanks
Anish
