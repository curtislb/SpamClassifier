This driver is not a stock driver from the kernel.  One needs to get 
it separately and install it (either from the rt2500-source package 
or directly from upstream).  

I played around with using rt2500 with aircrack in the past.  It worked 
fine in monitor mode but I don't remember if I tried injection.

The rt2500 driver is no longer being actively developed and it may lack 
certain features.  (Though it's fine unless you're looking for really 
specific things.  I still use it.)

Nowadays efforts are directed towards a more general driver called 
rt2x00 and this supports certain things the rt2500 doesn't.  (I think it
might have injection.  There's a package rt2x00-source which you can try 
out but make sure to check out
http://rt2x00.serialmonkey.com/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page
because there is a lot of development going on and the debian packages 
will not be the very latest.
