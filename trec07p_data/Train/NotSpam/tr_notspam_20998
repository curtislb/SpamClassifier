Posted: 3:37 PM, 6/20/07

By William Harwood
CBS News Space Analyst

Changes and additions:

   SR-77 (06/19/07): Atlantis undocks from space station
   SR-78 (06/19/07): Heat shield scan; analysts study debris
   SR-79 (06/20/07): Astronauts pack up for Thursday landing
   SR-80 (06/20/07): Deorbit timeline; updated backup landing times

3:37 PM, 6/20/07, Update: Entry timeline; updated backup landing opportunit=
ies=20

NASA flight controllers are assessing the weather and planning the shuttle =
Atlantis' trajectory for re-entry and landing Thursday at the Kennedy Space=
 Center. The astronauts, meanwhile, have tested the ship's re-entry systems=
 and are in the final stages of packing up for the return to Earth.

"I can't wait to get back and feel the air on my face and the sea breeze," =
space station astronaut Sunita Williams, wrapping up a record six-month sta=
y in orbit, told a reporter today. "I'm looking forward to hopefully going =
to the beach and taking a walk with my husband and my dog. That's the first=
 thing. And secondly, I just can't wait for a good piece of pizza."

Williams and her shuttle crewmates - commander Rick Sturckow, pilot Lee Arc=
hambault, flight engineer Steve Swanson, Patrick Forrester, Danny Olivas an=
d Jim Reilly - will have two opportunities on successive orbits to land at =
the Kennedy Space Center on Thursday.

Here is an updated timeline of key events (in EDT):
