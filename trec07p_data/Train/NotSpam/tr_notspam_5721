Bill aims to close 'terror' gap in gun laws

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department and a Northeastern Democrat have formed a rare alliance intended to restrict gun sales to terror suspects.

In some instances, the attorney general could let a sale go through -- for example, when stopping the sale would hinder a terrorism investigation.
