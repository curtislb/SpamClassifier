						On Newsnight my phone rarely rings at 6.14 am. But it did this mornin=
g. It was our deputy editor Robbie Gibb who was looking after <a href=3D"ht=
tp://news.bbc.co.uk/player/nol/newsid_6230000/newsid_6230500/6230572.stm?bw=
=3Dbb&mp=3Drm"><b>Zombie Brown: Prime Minister's Questions</b></a>, a speci=
al programme for News 24 and Newsnight in which the soon-to-be-PM was to fa=
ce questions from a panel of the BBC's sharpest minds.=20
<br>

<br>
Robbie was involved in a last minute flurry with Mr Brown's people over the=
 exact seating arrangements for the programme, which - because of the EU su=
mmit - could only be recorded at eight in the morning. It was symptomatic o=
f a process of negotiation to get Mr Brown onto the programme which was at =
times tortuous and always subject to change.=20
<br>

<br>
But when Mr Brown swept into the studio - at roughly twenty past eight - he=
 was a vision of relaxedness. The make-up lady remarked how warm and chatty=
 he was - more so in fact than Blair - his warm-up small talk was easy, his=
 jokes surprisingly good. And when the intense and wide-ranging grilling fr=
om Martha Kearney, Evan Davis, Nick Robinson, and John Simpson began, the o=
ld Brown, sticking rigidly to his sound bites, seemed to have disappeared. =
No prudence, no steering a steady course, not even much listening and learn=
ing. Could it be that Mr Brown - famously uptight and brooding as Chancello=
r - will, like Nicolas Sarkozy, find the top job strangely relaxing?
