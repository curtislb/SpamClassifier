Really... I'm very happy for this release! :D

This is easy. Could be implemented in desktop-base package?
We use it in Debian-BR-CDD project. One script detect these partitions and
mount in installation.

I can help you with it...

I agree...

I'm happy in help... :D
I created (waiting approval) the Debian Artwork project in Alioth. The idea
is use the CCHost (used by OpenClipart Project) for this contest and artwork
submission.
Debian Artwork would be a place for high quality artwork and themes for the
Debian Desktop.
The idea is use for contest, creating an archive of user contributed artwork
that can be freely used.
All themes and artwork are tested and moderated to ensure a high standard of
quality and to make certain they work.
These works will be used for the Debian Desktop team in his packages.

How about this ?
