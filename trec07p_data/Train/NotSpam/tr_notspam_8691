I have not been able to reproduce the failing test.  Having done a  
fresh 'svn update' of trunk, I then ran the test pre-configuration:

t/postconfigure/03-revision....1..7
ok 1 - use Cwd;
ok 2 - use File::Copy;
ok 3 - use File::Temp;
ok 4 # skip Either file DEVELOPING does not exist or configuration  
has not completed (as evidenced by non-existence of  
Parrot::Config::Generated
ok 5 # skip Either file DEVELOPING does not exist or configuration  
has not completed (as evidenced by non-existence of  
Parrot::Config::Generated
ok 6 # skip Either file DEVELOPING does not exist or configuration  
has not completed (as evidenced by non-existence of  
Parrot::Config::Generated
ok 7 - Completed all tests in t/postconfigure/03-revision.t
ok
         3/7 skipped: various reasons
All tests successful, 3 subtests skipped.
Files=1, Tests=7,  2 wallclock secs ( 0.18 cusr +  0.12 csys =  0.30  
CPU)

I then ran Configure.pl and re-tested before running 'make':

[parrot] 510 $ prove -v t/postconfigure/03-revision.t
t/postconfigure/03-revision....1..7
ok 1 - use Cwd;
ok 2 - use File::Copy;
ok 3 - use File::Temp;
ok 4 - current revision is all numeric
ok 5 - current revision is all numeric
ok 6 - current and config are identical
ok 7 - Completed all tests in t/postconfigure/03-revision.t
ok
All tests successful.
Files=1, Tests=7,  1 wallclock secs ( 0.17 cusr +  0.07 csys =  0.24  
CPU)

These are the results I would have expected.
