No, not at all. It's been years since I've followed -legal, and I
certainly don't keep track of who thinks what. I fundamentally don't
think it *matters* what individual subscribers to -legal think.

What I care about is having a reasonable, widely understood definition
of free software that meshes with the rest of the free software and open
source community, that Debian can use to work out what software we'll
distribute in main.

I don't think it's remotely obvious that the DFSG rules out all patent
non-enforcement clauses, I'm pretty sure it's not remotely obvious that
the DFSG rules out choice of venue clauses, and so far I haven't seen any
real reason why Debian needs to rule out those clauses. I can _certainly_
see why those sort of things might be more of a drawback than a benefit
and we might want to discourage their use, but we can say "bad" in ways
other than "non-free".

Cheers,
aj, who suspects he's against patent non-enforcement clauses in the past
