I think it is a bad, bad advice. And its wrong :-) You should tell your
system its not running UTC. Set UTC=no in /etc/default/rcS and your
system will run with local time, like Windows does.

You should never use hwclock. Let your system work for you, don't work
against your system :-)

other Problem:

No, not as far as I know. AFAIK this is the new?? but preferred way to
set the hardware clock. On some systems it isn't working, like yours. So
you should try to insert the option "--directisa" to the HWCLOCKPARS
variable in every /etc/init.d/hwclock*.sh

This should go away with --directisa
