Those devices use an ARM core.
ARM little endian if my memory serves.
x86 stuff isn't power efficient even in terms of things such as the centrino 
or pentium m, you end up running a laptop on 80 watts of juce give or take 
some. Now if we could get some of those olpc.org machines and put speakup in 
that kernel that would be nice indeed.

Regards, Kerry.
