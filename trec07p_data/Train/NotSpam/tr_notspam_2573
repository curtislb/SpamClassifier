Bob Orr will tell you more about Cho Seung-Hui, the 23-year-old English maj=
or responsible for killing 32 people before turning a gun on himself. Offic=
ials haven't yet put together a full picture of Cho, saying only that "he w=
as a loner." But there are some clues that might shed light on his motivati=
on, and we'll share those with you.=20

The identities of the victims are still being released, but it is already c=
lear that Cho's bullets cut across a wide swatch of the campus population. =
The dead range from bright college freshmen to a 76-year-old internationall=
y renowned engineering professor. Cynthia Bowers will bring you portraits o=
f those murdered.=20

Also, Sharyn Alfonsi will report on what happened in the critical two hours=
 when Cho eluded police.=20
