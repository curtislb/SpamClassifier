<B>TONIGHT ON SHOWBIZ TONIGHT - CNN HEADLINE PRIME 11pm
ET/PT</B>

<B>THE PARIS BLAME GAME!</B>
Why is Paris Hilton refusing to take responsibility for what
she did and just serve her 45-days in jail? The heated debate
on TV's most provocative entertainment news show.

<b>HOW LOW CAN LINDSAY LOHAN GO?</b>
Lindsay takes pot-shots at the rehab center that treated her,
saying they just didn't “get” her. Huh? But wait, there's more!
Tonight, Showbiz Tonight with the Outrageous Lohan comments
that made us say: What in the world is she thinking?!?!

<b>THE NASTY DAVID HASSELHOFF DIVORCE BATTLE</B>
Debra Opri, the attorney for the "Baywatch" star's wife, is
right here - and she's fired up! She's answering the tough
questions: Was her client, Pamela Bach, the one who released
that shocking tape, showing Hasselhoff drunk and shirtless?
What about startling accusations of abuse towards their
children?

<b>STARS HURT -- BY THEIR OWN WORDS!</b>
>From Mel Gibson to Isaiah Washington to Don Imus to Alec
Baldwin --- We're taking a look at how sometimes what the stars
say -- can really hurt their careers.

<b>SHOWBIZ TONIGHT QUESTION OF THE DAY:</b>
