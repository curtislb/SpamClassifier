   The problem here isn't the content of this specific bill (which isn't 
really bad), but the process by which it came forward.  The same 
lobbying tactics may be successful in getting extremely harmful bills 
brought forward and fast-tracked without consultation or debate.

   The Senate has its hands full with other bills (including the budget 
bill), and it is highly unlikely they will debate it at all.

   The Government wants to prorogue rather than recess for the summer as 
they want to Kill Bill C-30 (the by-committee revised Clean air and 
Climate Change act).  If they prorogue then this causes all unpassed 
bills die on the order paper, meaning all government and private members 
bills would have to be re-introduces and the Conservatives don't want 
there to be a climate change act.

   Some Liberal members of the senate have said they will delay the 
budget bill to force the Conservatives to recess, allowing them to pass 
the budget without this immediately killing C-30.

   This is all typical procedural trickery that the Conservatives are 
into.  I've seen them pull some pretty nasty fast ones, including last 
Friday when they tried to pass the budget through a loophole that 
involved a motion changing the order of business after most 
parliamentarians were already heading back to constituencies. 
Fortunately this one was caught (people running back into the house who 
were otherwise heading for a plane).  Pretty dishonest stuff, but not 
stuff the general public would understand -- and thus stuff they can get 
away with without voters getting upset.

   I wonder how much of this was in their controversial Handbook they 
created to describe how to manipulate parliament and committees.

BTW: I'm not wanting to pick on the Conservatives.  At least old-school 
Liberal members are generally honest about their hatred for the Internet 
and new media/new economy.   The Conservatives seem to rather avoid 
answering controversial questions and prefer to use procedural trickery.

   Hard to stick to being non-partisan with some of what I observe every 
day with the federal parliament.
