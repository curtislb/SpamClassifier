[0]hormiga writes "Some scholarly journals are [1]rejecting submissions
made using new Office 2007 formats. Science and Nature are among
publishers unwilling to deal with incompatibilities in the new formats,
and recommend using older versions of Office or converting to older
formats before submission. The new equation editor is cited as a specific
problem. [2]Rob Wier recommends that those publishers consider using
[3]ODF instead."

An anonymous reader sends us to a blog posting (with the YouTube video
embedded) about Linus Torvalds' talk at Google a few weeks back. [0]Linus
talked about developing GIT, the source control system used by the Linux
kernel developers, and exhibited his characteristic strong opinions on
subjects around SCM, by which he means "Source Code Management." SCM is a
subject that coders are either passionate about or bored by. Linus
appears to be in the former camp. Here is his take on Subversion:
"Subversion has been the most pointless project ever started...
Subversion used to say, 'CVS done right.' With that slogan there is
nowhere you can go. There is no way to do CVS right."

Preedit writes to tell us that those busy folks over at InformationWeek
have been scrutinizing yet more SEC filings, and [0]Novell and Microsoft
aren't the only ones concerned about certain provisions in the final
draft of GPLv3. [1]TiVo worries too. The problem is that TiVo boxes are
Linux-based. They're also designed to shut down if the software is hacked
by users trying to circumvent DRM features. But GPLv3 would prohibit
TiVo's no-tamper setup. "If the currently proposed version of GPLv3 is
widely adopted, we may be unable to incorporate future enhancements to
the GNU/Linux operating system into our software, which could adversely
affect our business," TiVo warns in a regulatory filing cited by
InformationWeek."

WBUR radio in Boston hosts [0]a talk with two physicists, Alan Guth and
Neil Turok, who represent, respectively, the consensus theory of the
inflationary Big Bang and an upstart theory of the initiation of the
universe in the collision of two three-dimensional "branes." [1]Turok and
[2]Paul Steinhardt developed their "Ekpyrotic proposal" out of the
mathematics behind string theory. In the audio the two physicists are
perhaps more respectful of one another's views than the host wishes them
to be. If you ignore the "let's you and him fight" framing of the debate,
you will hear some interesting physics elucidated.

[0]nbauman writes "New York Times interview with Amit Singhal, who is
[1]in charge of Google's ranking algorithm. They use 200 "signals" and
"classifiers," of which PageRank is only one. "Freshness" defines how
many recently changed pages appear in a result. They assumed old pages
were better, but when they first introduced Google Finance, the algorithm
couldn't find it because it was too new. Some topics are "hot". "When
there is a blackout in New York, the first articles appear in 15 minutes;
we get queries in two seconds," said Singhal. Classifiers infer
information about the type of search, whether it is a product to buy, a
place, company or person. One classifier identifies people who aren't
famous. Another identifies brand names. A final check encourages
"diversity" in the results, for example, a manufacturer's page, a blog
review, and a comparison shopping site."

[0]Daniel Dvorkin writes "In the latest example of over-the-top

production of AK-47s. According to first deputy prime minister Sergei
Ivanov, the unlicensed production of Kalashnikovs (which have been around
in very nearly their current form for 60 years) in ex-Soviet Bloc
countries is 'intellectual piracy.' A giant but declining power starts
demanding royalties on commonly used methods and materials that are
widely understood, well known, and by any reasonable standard have long
been in the public domain — does this sound familiar?" Wikipedia notes
that the Izhevsk Machine Tool Factory in Russia [2]obtained a patent on
the manufacture of the AK-47 in 1999.

The 700 MHz spectrum could give birth to the much-anticipated third pipe,
but phone and cable lobbyists are currently pressuring the FCC to sell
companies like AT&T and Verizon our airwaves — in a [0]flawed auction
process — so they can hoard this valuable spectrum and stifle competitive
alternatives to their networks. Google and other would-be providers
[1]are not taking it lying down. They want the FCC to mandate that
whoever wins the auction be required to sell access to those airwaves, at
wholesale prices, to anyone wanting to provide broadband Internet
service. They also want anonymous auctions to prevent the giant
incumbents from manipulating the results against small players (as they
have done in the past).
