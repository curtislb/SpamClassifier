Well my extra box I use to play with linux is now dead and I can not afford
at this time to replace it.  So I thought I would run a distro as a
vm.before I did all the work of getting it on a vm though I thought I would
ask here if any one has maid a vmware package with speakup and gnome with
orca working.
I here ubumpto is nice also but never played with that. any help would be
greatly apresheated.
