process for creating an inexpensive, nearly transparent, [0]electrically
conductive alumina cement. The conductivity is comparable to metal, and
the transparency should be adequate for use in display panels. The
process relies upon commonplace and inexpensive metals compared to the
rare metals such as iridium currently used in display panels."

perturbed1 writes "A Fermilab press release announced that [0]MiniBooNE's
latest results have [1]salvaged the Standard Model of particle physics.
The experiment ruled out the simple neutrino oscillation interpretation
of the 1990s LSND experiment. Neutrinos have a tiny amount of mass,
required by their oscillations, as observed in solar, atmospheric, and
reactor neutrino experiments. Combining this mass with the LSND
experiment's results required the presence of a fourth but 'sterile'
neutrino, breaking the 3-fold symmetry of particle families in the
standard model." Nice to see some good news out of Fermilab after [2]the

At least twenty-two readers took the trouble to make sure we knew that
[0]Kurt Vonnegut has died at 84. From the Times obituary: "Kurt Vonnegut,
whose dark comic talent and urgent moral vision in novels like
'Slaughterhouse-Five,' 'Cat's Cradle' and 'God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater'
caught the temper of his times and the imagination of a generation, died
last night in Manhattan... Mr. Vonnegut suffered irreversible brain
injuries as a result of a fall several weeks ago, according to his wife,
Jill Krementz." Reader [1]SPK adds: "He will be remembered not only as a
great writer, but also as a staunch civil libertarian (long-term member
of the ACLU) and as a 'mainstream/literary' author who integrated science
fiction concepts into his writing. So it goes."

[0]David Kesmodel from WSJ writes to let us know about an IBM
breakthrough: a practical [1]three-dimensional semiconductor chip that
can be stacked on top of another electronic device in a vertical
configuration. Chip makers have worked for years to develop ways to
connect one type of chip to another vertically to reduce size and power
use. The IBM technique of "through-silicon vias" offers a thousand-fold
reduction in connector length and a hundred-fold increase in connector
density. The new chips may appear in cellphones and other communication
devices as soon as next year. PhysOrg has [2]more details.

EmTeedee sends us to a blog post for a summary of the latest results in
[0]cracking AACS, from the Doom9 forums (as the earlier cracks have been)
— after the [1]DVD Security Group said it had patched the previous flaws.
>From the [2]DLTV blog: "This time the target was the Xbox 360 HD DVD add
on. Geremia on Doom9 forums has started a thread on how he has obtained
the Volume ID without AACS authentication. With the aid of others like
Arnezami they have managed to patch the Xbox 360 HD DVD add on... It
appears that XT5 has released [an] application that allows the Volume ID
to be read without the need to rewrite the firmware. This would mean that
anyone could simply plug in the HD DVD drive and obtain the Volume ID
from any HD DVD without the hassle of flashing it."

McConnell is seeking mostly affect a cloak-and-dagger category of
warrants used to investigate suspected spies, terrorists and other
national security threats. The court-approved surveillance could include
planting listening devices and hidden cameras, searching luggage and
breaking into homes to make copies of computer hard drives.' One of their
specific goals is prosecution immunity for communications companies who
comply with the program, a sheild for groups that violate privacy laws in
turning over information to the NSA. The article notes that 'Critics
question whether the changes are needed and worry about what the Bush
administration has in store, given a rash of allegations about domestic

Defense plans to launch in the first quarter of 2009 a [1]satellite-based
router to deliver military communications. Satellite operator Intelsat
will manage the three-year Internet Routing In Space (IRIS) project,
while Cisco will provide IP networking software for the on-board router.
After testing, the satellite will be available for commercial use. From
the article: 'Potential nonmilitary benefits of the IRIS program include
the ability to route IP (Internet Protocol) traffic between satellites in
space in much the same way packets are moved on the ground, reducing
delays, saving on capacity and offering greater networking flexibility,
Lloyd Wood, space initiatives manager in the Global Defense, Space &
Security division of Cisco, said Thursday.'"

[0]Lucas123 writes "There's a really good, detailed review at the
Computerworld site on [1]the top four external hard drives with more than
500GB of capacity. The story reveals some big flaws in the external
drives, like malfunctioning one-touch backup buttons, USB 2.0 ports that
don't recognize the drives, and drives coming out of the boxes
unformatted. It's also an eye opener with regard to actual backup speeds.
'Broadband connections, peer-to-peer networks and larger media files
coupled with new regulations that require diligence in backing up files
have clearly affected the external hard drive market as drive capacities
expand to 1TB and beyond. Meanwhile, the prices of those drives continue
to drop, making them ever more attractive, particularly with the ease of
deployment -- literally a two-minute installation, and you're ready to
go. We put four of the leading external hard drives to the test. Our
criteria were simple: The drives had to have multiple connection
technologies (USB 2.0 plus FireWire 400 or FireWire 800 or both), include
backup software and have a capacity of at least 500GB.'"

investigation by the U.S. Congress into the firing of eight U.S.
Attorneys by the Department of Justice, [0]numerous White House e-mails
have been lost. Among them are communications from presidential adviser
Karl Rove. Parallels are being drawn with the infamous '18 minutes'
missing from the Nixon Watergate tapes. Also at issue is the use of
Republican National Committee e-mail domains (such as gwb43.com and
georgewbush.com) rather than the official White House domain. This is a
violation of the Presidential Records Act."

BoredStiff writes "NYMag has up an article that explores Boss Science and
the minds of American corporate leaders. In the real world, bosses are
known to suffer from a long list of social pathologies: naked aggression,
credit hogging, micromanaging, bullying, you name it. Leadership research
shows that subtle nasty moves like glaring and condescending comments,
explicit moves like insults or put-downs, and even physical intimidation
can be effective paths to power. Research also shows that [0]employees
tend to see the jerk as boss material. The article goes on to discuss
some of the science bosses apply to making an operation run smoothly: 'A
researcher reported that one law firm deconstructs its HR needs by
personality traits. It insists on extremely bright employees who are also
extremely insecure. 'They want them to think that working really hard
matters,' he explains. Through this prism, personality types can even be
mixed and matched to make a team function more efficiently.'"

LanMan04 writes "For the first time, [0]researchers have read the
biological signature of a Tyrannosaur — a signature that confirms the
increasingly accepted view that modern birds are the descendants of
dinosaurs. Analyzing the organic material ([1]collagen protein) found
inside the unique fossil linked the collagen to several extant species.
The bottom line is that the T. rex's biological signature was most like a
bird's, at least based on the first fragmentary data. "It looks like
chicken may be the closest among all species that are present in today's
databases for proteins and genomes," one of the scientists interviewed
said."

release from Apple can be found on the 'Hot News' part of their site,
though Apple did not provide a permanent link to the story. 'While
Leopard's features will be complete by June, the Cupertino-based company
said it cannot deliver the quality release expected by its customers
within that time. Apple now plans to show its developers a near final
version of Leopard at the conference, give them a beta copy to take home
so they can do their final testing, and ship the software in October.'"

'Dallas police officer in a marked squad car who is captured on the
city's cameras running a red light [1]will have to pay the $75 fine if
the incident doesn't comply with state law ... Many police officers are
angry about the proposed policy. The prevailing belief among officers has
been that they can run red lights as they see fit.' Is this a case for or
against governments relying on un-biased automated systems? Or, should
anyone be able to control who is recorded on camera and who is held
accountable?"
