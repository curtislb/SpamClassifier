Hm, but with which would you explain a "hash" in plain english?
What would be the closest equivalents in the real world?

I'm not a native english speaker, but I've never heard or read the word
"hash" outside CS.

I guess this ones are close:
- collection (contra: doesn't imply the access to an item)
- dictionary (contra: might be assumed ordered)
- directory (contra: might be assumed ordered, clashes with a file
directory)
- index (contra: might be assumed ordered, might be too technical)

The problem with the implication of an order in the real world concepts
is that you probably won't find one that isn't ordered.
Those things allow us to find something easily by a word. But as we
first have to find that word, we have an ordered list of the words...

So there is no perfect candidate in the above list.
But in my opinion they are still more "english" than "hash".
Additionally I believe it would be easier to learn that it's (e.g.) a
dictionary that just is not ordered than learning a whole new word like
a "hash" (which it was for me as a non-native english speaker).
