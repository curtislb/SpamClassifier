Hello sm1lies,

There's less than one week left to get your submissions in for the 2007 TopCoder Open blog contest!

Through the blog contest -- now open at TopCoder Studio -- two lucky members will win a trip to Las Vegas to report on the onsite finals of the 2007 TopCoder Open, sponsored by AOL(R).  If your entry is chosen as the winner, you will win airfare, hotel accommodations and meals from June 26 through June 30, 2007!

For this contest, we're opening the floodgates to all manner of creative expression. Since this is a blogging competition, your entry must include at least some written text (up to a maximum of 500 words), but you can also include photos, hyperlinks, video, audio - the sky's the limit!  We've even given you guidelines for the theme of your submission.  Read all of the details and rules here: http://studio.topcoder.com/?module=ViewActiveContests

We'll be expecting something in return, naturally.  The winning members will be required to submit blog entries for the TopCoder website throughout the onsite finals.  Your perspective, your words - for everyone to read!

The deadline for entry into the contest is May 2. This could be your last chance to make it to Vegas -- don't miss out!   

Good luck!

- The TopCoder Competitions Team
