</table><font class="storytext">

<strong>Katie Couric</strong>'s barrage of bad publicity is coming not from the outside, but from the inside of CBS, sources tell me. 

</font></p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Indeed, one of Couric's frequently mentioned enemies is <strong>Bob Schieffer</strong>, the lovable, durable veteran journalist who filled in as anchor of the "CBS Evening News" between <strong>Dan Rather</strong>'s departure and Couric's arrival.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">But sources say that Schieffer has been unhappy lately, mainly because his airtime, which was prominent when Couric first started, has dwindled in recent weeks.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">It's been suggested that a hit piece on Couric written by <strong>Gail Shister</strong> in yesterday's Philadelphia Inquirer was inspired by Schieffer as its main source.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">"He has a direct line to her," one insider said.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Shister, strangely enough, was not supposed to be writing about TV anymore at the Inquirer. She was in a well-publicized battle with the paper after losing her 25-year-old column. But suddenly she resurfaced just to eviscerate Couric.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Shister, I see from a reading of her columns in the paper's archive, has been on Couric's case since before she started as anchor of the evening news.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">So, too, has the New York Times' most disliked media writer, <strong>Alessandra Stanley</strong>. As a woman, you would think Stanley would be more sympathetic to Couric, but she notes that Katie anchored a report wearing "white slacks and very little makeup."</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">What color were the suits worn by NBC's <strong>Brian Williams</strong> and ABC's <strong>Charlie Gibson</strong>? Were they wearing makeup, powder or lip gloss? Stanley didn't mention that.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">One Stanley column almost could have been called "A Valentine's Day Massacre." The Times writer went on and on about Couric's appearance and concluded that it was inconsistent. Stanley was more concerned about Couric wearing pearls one day and not on another than whether the show was any good.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">The fact is, the "CBS Evening News With Katie Couric" is pretty good.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">After accepting criticism that there was too much soft news and too many features, the show's producers have changed. So has the producer; <strong>Rick Kaplan</strong> replaced <strong>Rome Hartman</strong> a few weeks ago. Kaplan has since made the show harder.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">On Monday night, Couric's broadcast led with an FDA investigation and some real reporting about food poisoning. The two other newscasts started where they left off on Friday: with more of the same stuff from Virginia Tech.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">"We thought the public was turned off by more from there," a CBS insider told me Monday. "We thought it was starting to look unseemly."</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Couric's show last night also ran good features on rap music and on exonerated death row inmates after dealing with Virginia Tech, the death of <strong>Boris Yeltsin</strong> and a few other headlines of the day in the first 14 minutes.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">If Couric's enemies are within CBS — and every bit of evidence suggests they are — then it's time for CBS CEO <strong>Les Moonves</strong> to step up and do something.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">The CBS newscast is every bit as good as the ones on NBC and ABC, and it's not necessarily true that Americans only want their news from old white guys. But it's the old white guys who would be resistant more than anyone else to the changes at CBS.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Coincidentally, back in 1988 I commissioned an article for the now-defunct Fame Magazine on how much CBS News had already changed for the worse. What was known as the "Tiffany" network had already lost a lot of its luster.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">The author of the piece was <strong>David Halberstam</strong>, who died in a car crash Monday in Menlo Park, Calif. He was 73. It was an honor for me work with Halberstam, who was a fascinating guy and a gifted journalist. It kind of took my breath away when I heard how he died.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Halberstam already knew back in 1988 that the Rather-Schieffer era at CBS News was over. Those two were the last remnants of the <strong>Edward R. Murrow</strong>-<strong>Charles Collingwood</strong> news approach.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">The dynasty had been so watered down that Rather refused to let <strong>Walter Cronkite</strong> on the air after his ouster, and even then, the reporting on the "CBS Evening News" had become desperately out of date.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">There is a reason that Cronkite donated his voice-over introduction to Couric's broadcast: He likes and respects her. "60 Minutes" creator <strong>Don Hewitt</strong> is also a Couric fan. You may recall he said so in this space and told me he had once tried to get her away from the "Today" show for "60 Minutes" years ago.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Of course, both Cronkite and Hewitt are ex-officio at CBS News. But believe me, if they're Couric fans, there are others.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Katie, dear friends, is going to be the anchor of the "CBS Evening News" for a good long time to come — and that's a good thing.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext"><a id="2" name="2"><font class="fox411hed">'Law & Disorder,' Part 2: No More Noth?</font></a></p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">I told you yesterday about the turmoil at <strong>Dick Wolf</strong>'s "Law & Order" shows on NBC. Here's a little more.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Wolf, sources say, is in a huge-cost cutting move at the moment to keep classic "L&O" and "Criminal Intent" on the air.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">For the former show, he has already fired a producer and is thinking of axing the actors who play the cops. He would replace them with younger, cheaper people.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">For "Criminal Intent," it's a different story. There is talk that Wolf has suggested eliminating long time "L&O" player <strong>Chris Noth</strong> from "CI." Noth came on in 2006 to alternate episodes with <strong>Vincent D'Onofrio</strong>. The latter actor had become very difficult and the company required a soothing change.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">But D'Onofrio, they say, has calmed down. He is also less expensive than Noth, who is such a bona-fide star that he could easily carry his own show.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">On top of that, Noth has already gone through one co-star, <strong>Annabella Sciorra</strong>. Now I'm told that <strong>Julianne Nicholson</strong>, who replaced Sciorra, is already not coming back, thanks to her pregnancy.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Here's an interesting theory about why "CI" might survive while classic "L&O" might not. Apparently, "CI" is a hit in France, where the scripts are refilmed with French actors. The French production company pays a high fee for this.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">"They don't like the original 'Law & Order' because their judicial system doesn't allow for the way the show is divided between the cops and lawyers," an observer said. "'CI' is much easier for them to replicate."</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Stay tuned. ...</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext"><a id="3" name="3"><font class="fox411hed">Paul Simon Accepts Award, Asks for Presenter</font></a></p> 
		
			<p class="storytext"><strong>Paul Simon</strong>, in rare form, accepted an award last night from the We Are Family Foundation. Then he asked if the blond presenter came with it, too.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">The answer was no. But Simon's unscripted comment did get laughs at the Hammerstein Ballroom, where he was honored along with <strong>Dionne Warwick</strong> and Mercantile Exchange's <strong>Richard Schaeffer</strong>.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Among the other guests and presenters were <strong>Tony Bennett</strong>, <strong>Katie Couric</strong>, <strong>Clive Davis</strong> and <strong>Micky Dolenz</strong> of the <strong>Monkees</strong>. Couric told the crowd that she was so excited about Dolenz being there she had downloaded the Monkees' hit "Daydream Believer" the night before.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">We Are Family Foundation was started in September 2001 by <strong>Nile Rodgers</strong>, the famous music producer and leader of <strong>Chic</strong>, and <strong>Nancy Hunt</strong>.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Since then, they have raised millions of dollars and built schools in South Africa and South America. It's pretty impressive stuff. Last night, they raised more than $1 million.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Of course, the annual fundraiser is all about music. Dionne Warwick was in fine voice. She sang "I'll Never Love This Way Again" and "What the World Needs Now" with such gusto that her lasso-like tremolo easily overcame the hall's shaky acoustics.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">She also performed "That's What Friends Are For" with her ever-talented 12-year-old granddaughter, <strong>Cheyenne Elliott</strong>.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">That girl, whom I have written about before, just gets better and better. Warwick also brought along her sister, the great R&B singer <strong>Dee Dee Warwick</strong>, who scored many hits in the 1960s.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Paul Simon, though, stole the show with renditions of "50 Ways to Leave Your Lover," "Late in the Evening" and "You Can Call Me Al." He was backed by his own band plus Rodgers and Chic. Not bad.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Afterward, Chic turned the night into a dance party with "Le Freak," "Good Times" and "We Are Family."</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Through it all, <strong>Clive Davis</strong> — who came to present Warwick with her award, but also worked with Simon 40 years ago — stayed and enjoyed the music.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">This is kind of amazing, since I have been to shows lately where the execs from labels don't come at all to support their talent. Davis really is the last of his kind.</p>
