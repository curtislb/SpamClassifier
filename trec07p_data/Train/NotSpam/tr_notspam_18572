Not a good start, as the MPL does *not* meet the DFSG, in my opinion, as
well as in the opinion of other debian-legal regulars.
Discussions about the MPL can be found at
http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/06/msg00221.html

These additional restrictions are definitely non-free, IMO,
since they heavily limit the freedom to modify the interface (DFSG#3).

Moreover, there's the possible contradiction issue pointed out by
Michael Below in his reply, which could make the software
undistributable (without a separate additional license for the logo)...

Far worse than the obnoxious advertising clause, I would say...

My advice is try and persuade upstream to switch back to the GNU GPL v2,
since fixing each MPL issue would be a too long and error-prone process.

You're welcome.
