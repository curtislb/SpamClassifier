Are you referring to more than the primary group id thing?
That is the only one I know about.

I think this particular one is missing DNS on the DCs, I
myself have not seen that. This is the cluster that Tridge
is testing on. I myself have several applications where I
want winbind to authenticate for squid in a DMZ, and I only
want it to do the NTLM auth proxy. Nothing else. And for
security reasons the connection between the DMZ and any DC
should be shut down as much as possible. I know, 445 is
pretty bad, but it's better than everything necessary for
AD.
