This is exactly how I worked out the Artic Technologies serial disk  
transfer mode.  They sold a software pack you could buy for their  
notetakers that would give you some additional capabilities.
The problem was, they wanted several hundred dollars for the floppy  
drive their system used.
(although you could turn your pc into a floppy for the note taker if  
so desired) This is the program I wrote my own driver for (though I  
never finished it, so it's not really distributable)
But, it's easy enough to pretend to be the drive, and watch what the  
device sends back.
Lots of drivers are written using this approach.
And, I see no reason why usb devices should be any different.
