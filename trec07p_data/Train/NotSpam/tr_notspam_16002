Dear Prof.Baker
    Last week, we organised a seminar on CL at
National Legistration Assembly and invited Dr.Mongkol
Na Songkla, the Minister of MOPH to present what he
have done during the US and Geneva trips.
    He states clearly that even MERCK is quite a good
company, comparing with Abbott, always lower the EFV
price for Thailand, he told MERCK that if the price is
not more than 5% without anycondition, MOPH will buy
the brand name. However MOPH will contuinue buy some
amont from generic company because it prevents the
blackmail of big pharmas. He also reaffirms that  MOPH
will not revoke the CLs.
    So this position is still confirmed. Report of
media are not really well covered and not give any
detail.
     Thanks for your recommend.
     Kannikar
