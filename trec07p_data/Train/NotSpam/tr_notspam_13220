If I had meant only the ftpmasters, I would have said so. That said, I
did point to a message written by Joerg (an ftpmaster) about this
particular license.

The DFSG is a set of guidelines; there are many things that licenses
can do which would be anathema to Free Software but are not
specifically excluded by the DFSG. That said, the typical argument is
that giving up your right to have cases tried in your local venue is a
fee or royalty, and as such violates DFSG =A71. If you put your mind
to it, I'm sure you can come up with others.
