Sounds good, except for one aspect that concerns me: we are trying to
write a good *trademark* license; I would not complicate things further
by trying to write a trademark *and copyright* license.
I would rather avoid mixing those two areas of law.

What concerns me most is making the copyright grant of permission
conditional on the no-confusion condition.
Suppose I derive a new image from the Debian swirl logo, and assume that
my derivative work is sufficiently different that it's not confusingly
similar to the original logo.  It is my understanding that I would not
need any trademark license to use my heavily modified image (not even
for commercial use).  Is this correct?  I would instead need a copyright
license to create and distribute my derivative work.
With a copyright license that incorporates the no-confusion condition, I
would still be subject to this restriction, which on the other hand
would not make much sense at this point...
In summary, I think that enforcing trademark-like restrictions through
copyright would be possibly harmful...


I would rather adopt a well-established license (chosen among the ones
that meet the DFSG, obviously) for the copyright side of the licensing.
The Expat license would be fine, IMO.

Of course.

Thanks for your non-advice!  ;-)

Don't worry...
