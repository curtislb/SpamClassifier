A Lesson From The Earl Of Cardigan

What Next For Solar Stocks?

Google vs. Amazon

==

The first order of business today is apologizing to all veterans of the
Korean War for the omission of that event in my table listing the numbers
of Americans killed in wars.  To those of you who wrote, thank you.  Below
you'll find a corrected table, along with the numbers of casualties from a
few other wars as well.

Revolutionary War                  25,324
Indian Wars                                6,125
War of 1812                               2,260
Mexican War                           13,283
Civil War - North                  363,020
Civil War - South                 199,110
Spanish American War           2,893
Philippines War                        4,273
World War I                           116,708
World War II                          408,306
Korean War                             54,246
Vietnam War                           58,219
Iraq War                                      3,461 and counting

Those are the big ones.  Unlisted are dozens of smaller conflicts,
including the Barbary Wars of 1801-1815, the China Boxer Rebellion of
1900, Haiti in 1915-1920, Grenada in 1983 and Desert Shield/Storm in 1990
and 1991.

Many of these wars helped make the U.S. a better and safer place, and for
that I am grateful. Some campaigns are of questionable value in hindsight,
but that fact in no way demeans the contributions of those servicemen who
paid with their lives.

A little reflection on that subject, in fact, brings to mind Alfred, Lord
Tennyson's "Their's not to reason why, Their's but to do and die." The
quote is from "The Charge of the Light Brigade," by Tennyson, who wrote
the poem to honor the British who died or were wounded during the Battle
of Balaclava in 1854 in the Crimean War.

In the century and a half since then, the poem has come to symbolize both
the courage and tragedy of warfare, in part because the odds were so
heavily against the British.  Their 673 cavalrymen were grossly outmatched
by 20 battalions (5240 cavalry, thousands more infantry and 50 pieces of
artillery) of Russians.

But their "courage" was partly the result of poor communications!
The commanding officer, the Earl of Cardigan, had received written orders
to take the cavalry rapidly to the front and there prevent the enemy from
carrying away their guns.  But those orders were interpreted (by either
Cardigan, his subordinates or both) to mean the guns that could be seen a
mile down the valley, when in fact the orders referred to guns much closer
. . .that Cardigan couldn't see!

And so he charged, taking his troops all the way to the guns and back,
while taking fire from front, back and flank along the way.

And the tragedy?  Well, it wasn't the massacre that's popularly
remembered.  Of the 673 cavalrymen, 118 were killed and 127 were wounded.
Heavy casualties were inflicted on the Russian side, too, but exact
numbers are unknown.

So why does the incident remain in our consciousness in the 21st century? 
Because of Tennnyson.  Back then, poetry was a major media form, and the
dissemination of his poem, published less than seven weeks after the
battle, inflamed and legitimatized the sentiments about the incident that
persist to this day.

In the 21st century, of course, poetry has far less influence; in its
place we have television, radio and YouTube.  But the power of the media,
in the hands of both institutions and individuals, remains undiminished. 
And that, in general, is a good thing.  (Thoughts creep in here about the
restraints on freedom of speech in China, but I'll hold them for another
time.)

Interestingly, the official investigations that followed the battle at
Balaclava hastened the end of the British practice of buying commissions,
which until then had been the surest way for a wealthy man to become an
officer.  The Earl of Cardigan, for example, had paid 40,000 pounds for
his commission.  Rational minds concluded the military was better served
by men who had gained valuable experience by rising through the ranks.

Of such details is history made.

Back in the present day, the bull market continues, with the Dow, the S&P
500 and the NYSE advance-decline line all hitting new highs yesterday.

Overall, most stocks on our radar screen are acting very well, and it's a
great time to be aggressively invested.  In fact some day, we will look
back on this time with longing.

But solar power stocks are at a Moment of Truth (MOT) here.  They've
corrected over the past few weeks so that most are sitting at support.  If
that support fails from here, the recovery is likely to be long.  But if
support holds here - and so far it's holding - this could prove to be a
great entry point.

My guess is that the stocks will hold, and the reason is simple.
It's that the global push to clean energy is so big, and so early in its
development, that's it's nearly impossible for this trend to be over yet.

Part of the story here is the change in consciousness among American
consumers, and that's big.

Consider bottled water, for instance.  In most cases, this water is no
safer or better tasting than tap water.  Yet today, everyone's got a
bottle, from the ministers around the table at the G8 conference to the
kids in Little League. It's a triumph of marketing; Americans spent $11
billion last year buying some 83 billion gallons of bottled water.  But
where do all those plastic bottles end up?  Recycled (which takes energy)
or in landfills (which pollutes).

So now fine dining establishments in New York City and elsewhere are
tuning in to the sensibilities of their customers and offering . . . tap
water.  And I'm betting that's just the beginning of a retreat from the
bottled water craze.

In a similar vein, the city of Las Vegas, trying hard to "do the right
thing," offered tax credits for businesses that built energy-efficient
buildings.  Trouble is, the administration woefully underestimated demand
and wound up retroactively modifying it to shrink those advantages.

Back on the consumer side, individuals continue to line up for
hybrid-powered cars, not necessarily because they will save any money
doing so but because it's good for the earth.  At the extreme, there's the
new Lexus LS 600h, a luxury sedan that will get about 18 miles per gallon
in real-life driving and cost over $100,000 when it goes on sale this
summer.

And then there's the price of oil, which remains high.  In fact, some
analysts claim the long-term uptrend is still intact and predict that oil
will hit $100 per barrel in the years ahead!

For all these fundamental reasons, I don't think the solar stocks are done
yet.

And there's one more reason.  Triple-digit revenue growth in a company
(100% or better) is one of the most reliable indicators that a stock will
become a winner for us.  When we see a company growing revenues at that
rate, we know something big is happening fast, and we know that the stock
often rewards early and patient investors.

 But what about the current situation, when almost every company in the
whole industry boasts that rapid growth?

Well, we've never been in that boat before.  The early days of the
Internet boom saw something similar, but many of those companies weren't
making money, and many of them never did!  Most solar power companies are
making great profits right here, and I believe their future is bright for
both them and their stocks.

I've mentioned individual names before, and no doubt I will again in the
future.  For details, you should be reading either Cabot Market Letter of

Finally, a little face-off between Google (GOOG) and Amazon (AMZN).
Which stock would you rather own?

Google is one of America's favorite companies today.  You can't help but
love the service, which is a dream come true to knowledge junkies like me,
and increasingly valuable to companies large and small all over the globe.
 Also, Google owns YouTube, which is a cultural home run with a bright
future.  And everyone knows that Google hires the brightest people in the
country.

In fact, today's Boston Globe had a puff piece on Google office in
Cambridge (right outside Boston), where employees play video games, have
lava lamps and maybe do some work.

And how are the numbers?  On the revenue side, Google shows decelerating
growth over the past two years, with the revenue growth rate decreasing
from 98% to 63%.  On the earnings side, the deceleration has not been as
linear, but there as well, the latest quarter shows the lowest growth rate
in the past two years.  Profit margins, however, have always been very
impressive, and they just hit an all-time high of 31.6%.  If these trends
continue, Google will continue to grow, at an ever-slower rate
(notwithstanding the occasional huge acquisition), and continue to make
ever more money, a fact that eventually should lead to higher stock
prices.

But what does the stock's chart say?

First, that GOOG has underperformed the broad market since the end of
2005, when it hit 475. Today it's up just 5% since then, while the S&P 500
is up 22% and the Nasdaq is up 18%.

Second, that the stock hit an all-time high of 513 in the third week of
January of this year, and now, at 500, is working to break out above that
level.  If it can, great; such a breakout might spark the stock's next
uptrend.  On the other hand, every day waiting for that breakout is a day
that you could be making money in a growth stock that's actually going
up.

Yet every month, more and more institutions own Google!  There are now
more than 800 mutual funds on board.  In our office we have an unofficial
red line at 1000, meaning that when the number of institutions that own a
stock tops 1000, it's so well-respected that its best days as an
investment are likely past.

Conclusion:  Google is one of the greatest companies on earth, but because
a majority of investors hold the same opinion, it's no longer a great
stock, and you should always be careful not to confuse the company with
the stock.

Which brings us to Amazon.

Amazon (AMZN) was one of our greatest investments.  The Cabot Market
Letter held it from January 1998 to January 2000, racking up a 1290%
profit in the process.  After that, it crashed, like all Internet stocks,
and we were very happy to be out of it.

In November 2002, when it was trading at 22, Amazon earned a spot in Cabot
Top Ten Report and it ran all the way to 61, eleven months later. That was
followed by three years of sub-par performance that only a mother could
love.

But just five weeks ago, on May 1, Amazon again earned a spot in Cabot Top
Ten Report.  It was trading at 61 at the time, having just vaulted 28% -
in one day, and on massive volume! - on the strength of its quarterly
earnings report.  But was that too late to buy?  No way!  Editor Mike
Cintolo told Cabot Top Ten Report readers to buy there and today, AMZN is
15% higher.

Now, when I first reported this on May 3, I told you I didn't like Amazon
as an investment.  My main reservation was that the company was too well
known and respected.  But I've considered some more facts since then,
including the stock's trading over the past month, and I've changed my
mind.

Looking at the fundamentals, I see something quite different at Amazon
than I do at Google.  I see accelerating growth of revenues over the past
five quarters, the result of investments that Amazon has made in recent
years.  I see earnings growth of 117% in the latest quarter, as those
investments pay off on the bottom line.  I see profit margins of 3.7%,
minuscule compared to Google's (and not comparable because the companies
are in different industries), but a real improvement from the margins of
the past year.  And I see only 268 mutual funds on board . . . and no puff
pieces in newspapers.

And what of the chart?  Well, it's strong, which is how it earned a spot
in Cabot Top Ten Report. In breaking out above 61, it exceeded its old
2003 high, which left it free to head for the old high of 2000 at 113. 
And in the month since then it's climbed to 70, and held there very
tightly, drawing no pressure from sellers.

Conclusion: Amazon, out of the spotlight for so long, is now under
accumulation by institutions who recognize the new trend of accelerating
growth, and buying on normal corrections is recommended.
