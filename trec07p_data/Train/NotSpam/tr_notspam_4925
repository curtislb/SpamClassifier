Do you have any ideas on how to achieve this?

I guess that the most obvious current thing that ties Parrot to the Perl
community is that Parrot requires a copy of Perl to bootstrap, and all the
build tools are written in Perl 5.

I know that Perl 5's build system attempts to get a minimal Perl 5 binary
bootstrapped as early as possible, and then does the rest of the build using
Perl 5 programs running on it. I've just tried out Ruby, Python and Lua.
Akin to Perl, Ruby builds a miniruby, and then uses that to build the
extensions. Python doesn't build a minipython, but does use the Python binary
as part of the extension build process. Lua is the odd one out - it doesn't
ship with a Configure script, just a Makefile, and doesn't appear to build
anything outside the main source directory.

So Parrot is the odd one out here, for relying on an external language for
its extended build process. I'm not sure if this is significant.
