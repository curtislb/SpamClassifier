In speechd-up are any know problems now. Regarding speech dispatcher I
use latest announced cvs version dayly on dual core machine and works.
There was probably problem with glib libraries so Hynek Hanke rewrite
part of libspeechd which don't use this library now.

I think that is much stable then stable version :-)
