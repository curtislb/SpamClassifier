Yes indeed, thanks for our fearless backporters.

"It all worked" -- I don't run Java much myself, but I think starting with
the previous Ubuntu release and the actual Sun packages directly acessible
via apt-get, it worked.

However, with the current packages in my Kubuntu setup at work, I do get a
segfault once JGR is up and loaded.   I suspect, as Stefan said here, that
this is due to the Java 6 packages in Ubuntu.  As I said, sun-java5-jdk seems
to have work along with 'sudo R CMD javareconf', Simon's powerful Java
parameter setter for R.

In any event, we should carry this over to r-sig-debian.
