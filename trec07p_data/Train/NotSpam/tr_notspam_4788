[0]Hypertwist writes "Despite all the anti-malware roadblocks built into
Windows Vista, Microsoft technical fellow [1]Mark Russinovich is lowering
the security expectations, warning that viruses, password-stealing
Trojans, and rootkits will continue to thrive as malware authors adapt to
the new operating system. Even in a standard user world, he stressed that
malware can still read all the user's data; can still hide with user-mode
rootkits; and can still control which applications (anti-virus scanners)
the user can access. From the article: '"We'll see malware developing its
own elevation techniques," Russinovich said. He demonstrated a social
engineering attack scenario where a fake elevation prompt can be used to
trick users into clicking "allow" to give elevated rights to a malicious
file.'

aeoneal sends us to PhysicsWeb for news guaranteed to induce headache in
those wedded to the reality of, well, reality. Researchers from the
University of Vienna have shown the violation of a stronger form of
Bell's inequality known as Leggett's inequality. The result means that we
must not only give up Einstein's hope of "no spooky action at a
distance," [0]we must also give up (some of) the idea that the world
exists when we are not looking. From the article: "[Studies] have ruled
out all hidden-variables theories based on joint assumptions of realism,
meaning that reality exists when we are not observing it; and locality,
meaning that separated events cannot influence one another
instantaneously. But a violation of Bell's inequality does not tell
specifically which assumption — realism, locality, or both — is
discordant with quantum mechanics." From the [1]Nature abstract: "Our
result suggests that giving up the concept of locality is not sufficient
to be consistent with quantum experiments, unless certain intuitive
features of realism are abandoned." Only subscribers to Nature, alas, can
know what features those are, as PhysicsWeb doesn't tell us.

Leading the [1]resistance to this change is high-end chocolate maker
Guittard, with significant grass-roots support from the [2]Candyblog. The
FDA is [3]taking consumer comments until April 25. Here is the [4]FDA
page on the proposed change, which oddly enough does not say what the

article reports, 'Researchers at Paul Verlaine University in Metz said

people out of every seven aged over 65 could not get their votes

efficiency, but surprisingly mentions little (aside from user trust

produce voting machines. The manufacturer of these particular machines is

Fictional literature. Dr. Chris Stanley, from the BBC article: 'Towards

service that Time Warner Cable is offering to its customers. Flying in
the face of most business decisions about Wi-Fi availability, Time Cable
customers will soon be able to [0]turn their connections into public
wireless hotspots. This privilege comes as Time Warner inks a deal with
the Spanish startup Fon, which is already operating a similar deal with
ISPs in Europe. "For Time Warner Cable, which has 6.6 million broadband
subscribers, the move could help protect the company from an exodus as
free or cheap municipal wireless becomes more readily available. Fon was
founded in Spain in 2005 on the premise that people shouldn't have to pay
twice -- once at home, then again in a coffee shop -- for Internet
access. At first, the company offered software that let members, called
Foneros, turn Wi-Fi routers into shared access points, but it took hours
to get up and running."

criticism within the U.S. and that few countries are actually listening
since most ignore the recommendations. 'While the report will generate
media headlines and cries for immediate action from Industry Minister
Maxime Bernier and Canadian Heritage Minister Bev Oda, the reality is
that Canada's record on intellectual property protection meets
international standards. Moreover, differences between the U.S. and
Canadian economies - the U.S. is a major exporter of cultural products
and has therefore unsurprisingly made stronger copyright protection a
core element of its trade strategy while Canada is a net importer of
cultural products with a billion dollar annual culture deficit - means
that U.S.-backed reforms may do more harm than good.'"

involve exciting electrons to the point of jumping to a higher state
which leaves 'holes.' Unfortunately, these electrons and holes remain in
the same regions and therefore tend to recombine. The new nanotubes hope
to route these excited electrons off in the same way a coaxial cable
allows a return route for electrons. End result is fewer electrons
settling back into their holes once they are elevated out of them
yielding a higher return in energy."

Electronics Association (now known as AeA) that they think [0]mitigates
the effect of outsourcing on IT employment. US demand for tech workers is
through the roof, the highest it has been since the boom of the late 90s.
The tech sector added some 150,000 new jobs 2006, and there are no signs
that interest will flag in the near future. 'There is so much global
demand for employees proficient in programming languages, engineering,
and other skills demanding higher level technology knowledge that
outsourcing can't meet all U.S. needs. "There would have been a lot more
than 147,000 jobs created here, but our companies are having difficulty
finding Americans with the background," says William Archey, president
and chief executive of the AeA. One culprit is the dearth of U.S.
engineering and computer science college graduates. Second, immigration
caps have made it difficult for highly skilled foreign-born employees to
obtain work visas. Congress has been debating whether to increase the
numbers of foreign skilled workers allowed into the country under the
H-1B visa program.' "

iPhone to business users and is scurrying to ensure that its backend
enterprise billing and support systems will accommodate the device when
it ships. Analysts are baffled by the move. In addition to running an OS
X-based operating system, which enterprises may be reluctant to adopt,
the iPhone is also expected to have a number of shortcomings for business
users, including not having a removable battery and not having buttons,
which would make it difficult to dial while driving says Gartner's Ken
Dulaney. Avi Greengart, principal analyst for mobile devices at Current
Analysis, also thinks the iPhone won't be a good option for enterprise
customers because enterprises won't be able to write applications for the
phone."

goombah99 writes "[0]Netcraft is showing that an event happened in the
Ohio 2004 election that is difficult to explain. The [1]Secretary of
State's website, which handles election reporting, normally is directed
to an Ohio-based IP address hosted by the Ohio Supercomputer Center. On
Nov. 3 2004, Netcraft shows the website pointing out of state to a server
owned by Smartech Corp. According to the American Registry on Internet
Numbers, Smartech's [2]block of IP addresses 64.203.96.0 – 64.203.111.255
encompasses the entire [3]range of addresses owned by the Republican

Presidential Records Act, from which [5]thousands of White House emails
vanished." Update: 04/25 01:24 GMT by [6]KD : ePluribus Media published a
piece called [7] Ken Blackwell Outsources Ohio Election Results to GOP
Internet Operatives, Again on election eve 2006, when a similar DNS
switch to Smartech occurred. They have been investigating the larger

An anonymous reader writes "Yesterday [0]India successfully launched an
Italian astronomical satellite. A BBC article ([1]view video clip) notes
that the launch grants India membership in the exclusive group of
[2]nations that can sustain commercial satellite launches. India's launch
vehicle has less overall capacity than the competition — up to 1,500 kg
to orbit — but the country plans to sweep the low end of the market by
offering the lowest cost per launched kilogram for smaller payloads."

A bunch of readers sent us word on the prototype for a [0]new
general-purpose processor with the potential of reaching trillions of
calculations per second. TRIPS (obligatory back-formation given in the
article) was designed and built by a team at the University of Texas at
Austin. The TRIPS chip is a demonstration of a new class of processing
architectures called Explicit Data Graph Execution. Each TRIPS contains
two processing cores, each of which can issue 16 operations per cycle
with up to 1,024 instructions in flight simultaneously. The article
claims that current high-performance processors typically are designed to
sustain a maximum execution rate of four operations per cycle.

released Tuesday. The statement was released by Anderson's lawyer, Jerome
Roth, after Anderson settled with the Securities and Exchange Commission
related to Apple's stock option plan without admitting or denying any
wrongdoing.' This is serious business. It is quite possible that the SEC
could someday require Jobs to resign from Apple."

the CAN SPAM Act had to the prevention of spam. It allows [0]exceptions
for companies to utilize spyware for any number of reasons; if this bill
had been law when Sony distributed their rootkit, they would have had
perfect cover. Most troubling is that the bill would preempt all state
laws, including those more focused on the privacy of people's data, and
disallow individuals from bringing suit. It is expected to pass soon with
'strong bipartisan support.'"
