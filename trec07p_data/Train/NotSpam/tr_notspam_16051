I think your eSpeak settings are correct. Please, what is the
DefaultVolume setting in your speechd.conf? I´d expect it is 100 (max),
which explains your situation (100 gets mapped to 200).

It is not unreasonable to have maximum volume set by default in
speechd.conf. Since we miss a proper audio system on GNU/Linux,
with the simple audio output through ALSA in Speech Dispatcher, setting
DefaultVolume to 0 would mean that for most speech synthesizers
the default volume will be very quiet by default comparing to the rest
of your system :( So there is this setting to 100 so that users
don´t have a problem right from the start. You can allways change it
to what you like.

I´ll change the default espeak-generic.conf parameters for the new
eSpeak range in the next version of speechd.

With regards,
Hynek Hanke
