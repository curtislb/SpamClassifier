   Please, take a moment of your time to write a letter to your member 
of parliament to let them know about the DVD that Darryl sent out.  I am 
including a sample letter below.

   Finding your MP's contact information is as easy as going to 
http://www.digital-copyright.ca/edid/postal or 
http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Parlinfo/Compilations/HouseOfCommons/MemberByPostalCode.aspx?Menu=HOC 
and typing in your postal code.

   Thank you..

Dear Mr. McGuinty,


   Recently you received a DVD in the mail from Darryl Moore.  I would
like to recommend you take a look at the DVD, and to let other members
of parliament know about it as well.

   Jack Kapica of the Globe and Mail wrote about it on his BLOG.

   More information can be found on the http://www.deathbycopyright.ca/
  Website.


Thank you.
