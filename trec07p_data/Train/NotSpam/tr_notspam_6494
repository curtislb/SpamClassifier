Why not?

Are you asking a question? Perhaps you want to know whether a
subroutine needs to be declared before using it. No, not in Perl. But
you may do so, as you found. Your code should work the same with or
without that declaration, I believe.

Are you complaining that Perl is similar to C? Are you rejoicing that
Perl is similar to C?

Are you having trouble expressing your question in English? Feel free
to ask in another language if you think that might help.

Cheers!
