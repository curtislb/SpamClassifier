The problem with the current offerings is that the manufacturers
are unwilling to give out programming docs.  Hence, no speakup
support.  I won't do business with those kind of people, even though
the Triple Talk is well within my budget.  I would suggest that others
do the same.

I wonder about the possibility of reverse-engineering one
of these synths using a Windows system.  For example, usbsnoop is a
win32 program that can monitor traffic to and from USB devices
(see http://benoit.papillault.free.fr/usbsnoop/).
