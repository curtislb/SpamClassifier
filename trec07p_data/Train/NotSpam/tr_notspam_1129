Just to elaborate a bit further on what I did: There's a macro called 
PARROT_API (see F<include/parrot/config.h>) which is used to tag all 
symbols to be exported.  On Win32 it expands to C<__declspec(dllexport)> 
to export the symbol (see F<config/init/hints/mswin32.pm>), for others 
to nothing.  For my test I defined it as C<__attribute__ ((visibility 
("default")))>.
