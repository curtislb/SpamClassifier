OK. Replying to two different list (which I'm not subscribed to).

You're right. I used to be very opposed to Perl 6. Now understand that it has 
some nice improvements over Perl 5, but still find looking at its code to be 
quite a bit of a future shock. "Perl 6 is a nice language. Too bad it's not 
Perl." ;-)

Yes, that's right.

Hmmm... are you sure?

Well hopefully you would be able to call Rindolf code from Perl 6 code and 
vice versa. Also see:

http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/ideas/#tucan

For a different approach for creating a cross-language interaction layer. I 
admit that I haven't started working on it yet.

Well, I prefer a "Do and let do" and (less preferably) a "Complain and let 
complain" approach than a hurt calcalution. Some people found value in Perl 
6, and Audreyt actually created an implementation that sort-of-works. People 
are also having fun working on Parrot and other related projects. As you 
know, perl5 (the C-based implementation) has also not been completely 
neglected, and its hackers are doing fine.

This reminds me of the standard "isn't there a better way to spend the time 
working on Porting to MS Windows" myth. If there are people who are willing 
to do something FOSSy, then it is worth doing.

Thanks!

Like I said - no promises. Maybe I'll get to hacking on punie - maybe I won't. 
The day is short, and I have a lot of work to do.

Hmmm.... I haven't been closely following Parrot.

As I said, I'm sending it to p6-language and p6-internals instead.
