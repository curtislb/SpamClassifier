Not ignoring that will nullify your argument.
Regexps/rules are great, and I never said anything differing. If the
syntax gets more readable without any cost (in which I belive) its even
better.
Now do s/Regexps\/rules are/Perl is/ on the last sentence.

My suggestions won't have an impact on the expressiveness of Perl.
So in many cases you might have even less characters on your screen.
Of course some special character sequences would be replaced by word
character sequences, but that won't fill your screen by a magnitude.
