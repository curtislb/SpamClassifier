Global Warming is not about pollution. It's about carbon 
dioxide...supposedly.

I will never agree that carbon dioxide is pollution. In fact, without 
carbon dioxide, there's no photosynthesis and we all die.

Not a single scientist has been able to answer these simple questions:

1. What is the optimum temperature of the Earth?

2. What is the optimum percentage of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

3. Why did we have global cooling through the 1950s, 1960s and half of 
the 1970s?
