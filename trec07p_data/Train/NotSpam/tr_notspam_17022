Lou Dobbs Tonight
Wednesday, June 6, 2007

Tonight, the U.S. Senate continues to vote on the nearly 100
amendments to the so-called comprehensive immigration reform
bill. The so-called grand compromise narrowly survived a
potentially fatal challenge today when Sen. John Cornyn’s
amendment that would limit the number of illegal aliens who’d
receive amnesty. But is the deal on the brink of collapse?

A hot topic at the GOP debate was immigration, and the
candidates’ responses showed the rift in the Republican Party.
Senator John McCain said the bill before the Senate is
something he would not have written but will defend it to the
end. Rudy Giuliani called Washington efforts a mess and said
the bill will only make things worse. Mitt Romney suggested
immigration reform is not a choice between mass deportations
and this bill, saying we should enforce the laws we already
have. We’ll report on the 10 Republican candidates’ stance on
the Senate’s bill.

Big Business is gearing up to weaken the tough employer
sanctions included in the Senate’s amnesty legislation.
Included in the bill are provisions that would require
employers to check the legal status of the people they are
employing.  A provision business groups say is too burdensome.
We’ll have a full report tonight.

Border Betrayal: We’ll also update viewers on the fight to free
former Border Patrol agents, Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean.
Both agents were sentenced to 11 and 12 years in prison
respectively for shooting a Mexican drug dealer on the U.S. –
Mexican border.

Tonight we'll be joined by Sen. Tom Coburn, who says President
Bush hurts himself every time he says the Senate immigration
plan is not amnesty. The Senator sits down with Lou to tell us
why.

latest commentary on why it’s a crying shame that our leaders
in Washington are dividing us instead of uniting us.

Business, and Special Interest Groups Are Waging War on the
