While not being aware about this particular one, there are
probably quite a few of those. For example "netbios name" in
domain mode will certainly not be picked up correctly, it
would require a change of our workstation name in the DC.

But when you think about the security=3Duser -> security=3Dshare
one, there is exactly nothing we can do about that. If that
is caught between negprot (where we tell the client to do
sec=3Duser) and the session setup (where we don't want it
anymore), then the only right thing is to panic or cleanly
exit. The only other option would be to ignore security=3D
changes in a child smbd.
