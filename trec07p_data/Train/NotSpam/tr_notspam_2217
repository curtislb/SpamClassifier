John:

Not sure if this will help, but I have the exact type of laptop you 
mentioned (t22, S3 video).

I had one video problem, that was solved. YOu can find the HOW-TO at this 
address.

Hope this helps.

I ran Synaptic upgrade from Sarge to Etch without bothering to read the 
upgrade
docs first:-(
Synaptic completed ok, just the usual questions about
what to keep and what to replace. Noted that menu fonts in firefox were 
changed.
I rebooted and now have just a command line. GUI tries to start, but fails.

Any help would be much appreciated.
