In that case, you are 100% sure that the intercept *should* be zero,
but you aren't 100% sure that the measurements have a best fit with
intercept zero.  There could have been some systematic error that is
throwing things off.  It seems safer to leave the intercept in and let
the data show that the intercept is insignificantly small.  However, I
don't really know enough to know whether that is always the best
approach.  (And given that R provides a facility for excluding the
intercept, I suspect there must be some good reason for doing so in
some circumstances.)
