[0]godzillopiteco sends timely word that Art. Lebedev Studio is finally
going to accept pre-orders for the Optimus Maximus Keyboard — in just
under 11 hours at the time this story posts, according to the
[1]countdown timer on the site. (Late last year we were primed to
[2]pre-order in December 2006.) Read [3]the project's blog for some
recent developments.

[0]em8chel writes "[1]LinuxTag, Germany's major fair for Linux and Free
Software, is facing a massive boycott from open source enthusiasts in the
country this year. Although the event doesn't open for a week, the
community is voicing their anger and disappointment on various forums
about this year's LinuxTag running under the auspices of [2]Wolfgang
Schaeuble, the conservative Minister of Interior, whose positions on
issues of interest to the community are controversial to say the very
least. Due to online protests and calls for a boycott, the organizer of
LinuxTag has released a statement ([3]German version, [4]serviceable
Google translation), holding that the politician's policies and political
views have nothing to do with supporting free software, adding that if
the community boycotts LinuxTag, it's the open source software that will
be hit the hardest, and that Schaeuble probably won't even notice."

a plan to change the way kids learn chemistry. Yesterday he [0]stole the
show at TiECON 2007, the big entrepreneur conference held in Santa Clara,
CA. VentureBeat has the story and a video interview. The company's VP of
sales is the CEO's sister. She's 11. They're looking for $100K to ramp up
production and distribution.

mrchubbs writes "Sponsors and subscribers to XM Radio are protesting the
[0]decision by XM management to suspend the Opie and Anthony show for
comments made on an uncensored channel. [1]Subscribers are canceling
subscriptions — some estimate that between 20,000 and 40,000 have
cancelled. Some are even smashing their radios in protest. [2]Sponsors
are pulling ads. Also, there is some evidence of [3]XM not honoring
cancellation requests, forcing multiple calls to finally get accounts
canceled." Of course this dispute isn't a free-speech issue. "Free
speech" refers to a prohibition on censorship by the government; XM is
free to do as it wishes with the content it broadcasts, within the law.

vendors can [0]learn a great deal from how video games are designed. This
makes a lot of sense — how many professionals like working with their
software in the office as much as gaming after hours? Developers can deal
with looking at tables and grids full of data to make decisions and get
things done, but other types of workers (executives, salespeople, etc.)
have little to no attention span and need a picture to be worth a
thousand words, i.e. their software designed completely differently."

Several readers sent in a link to an op-ed in the NYTimes by novelist
Mark Halprin, who lays out the [0]argument for what amounts to perpetual
copyright. He says that anything less is essentially an unfair public
taking of property: "No good case exists for the inequality of real and
intellectual property, because no good case can exist for treating with
special disfavor the work of the spirit and the mind." This community can
surely supply a plethora of arguments for the public domain, words which
don't appear in the op-ed. In a similar vein, reader [1]benesch sends us
to the BBC for a tale of aging pop performers (virtually) serenading
Parliament in favor of [2]extending copyright for recording artists in
the UK. Some performers are likely to outlive the current protections,
now fixed at a mere 50 years.
Update: 05/20 22:50 GMT by [3]KD : Podcaster writes to let us know that
the copyright reform community is [4]crafting a reply over at Lawrence
Lessig's wiki.

hydrogen from water by oxidizing aluminum in an alloy with gallium. In
the presence of water the aluminum oxidizes, leaving aluminum oxide,
gallium, and hydrogen gas. The Purdue scientists who discovered the
effect think this could help to overcome difficulties with hydrogen
storage. Quoting: 'On its own, aluminum will not react with water because
it forms a protective skin [of aluminum oxide] when exposed to oxygen.
Adding gallium keeps the film from forming, allowing the aluminum to
react with oxygen in the water.'"
