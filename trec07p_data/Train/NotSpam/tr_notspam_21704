   I would even separate counterfeiting from other trademark issues. 
Trying to pretend to be someone else, or pretend to be approved/etc by 
an organization, is different than simple confusion in the marketplace 
around brands.


   One issue that is important is the unauthorized use of standards 
logos when the product/service has not been approved.   An example would 
be putting the CSA approved logo on a product that had not been CSA 
approved.

   This is one of the problems with the IPR language in that it mixes 
entirely unrelated things together as if they are related.   While I 
believe that stronger enforcement of things like labeling is necessary 
(And lets include controversial products and techniques such as GMO's 
-- something parliament has consistently voted against), but that the 
expansion of exclusive rights in the form of copyrights and patents are 
entirely different.

   In my letter to Industry committee members I am trying to make clear 
(and in as small a letter I can) that the issue is the 1996 WIPO 
treaties which have nothing to do with "counterfeiting" or "piracy" in a 
more reasonable definition of those terms.

   Since you can have your own opinions for this forum, why not in 
letters to your MP?   This really is an issue where the primary problem 
is that they are only hearing from one side of the debate.  While there 
is some blame on parliamentarians and the government, we also have some 
blame for not spending adequate time making ourselves known to MPs.

   All I hope is that people try to speak to their own MP, and if they 
have availability MPs in ridings near them.


   Anyone live in or near any of the members of Industry committee?  The 
ridings are listed at the bottom of the message:
