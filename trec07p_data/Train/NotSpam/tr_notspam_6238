[0]Roland Piquepaille writes "As you probably know, carbon nanotubes have
very interesting mechanical, electrical and optical properties. The
problem, currently, is that they're too small (relatively speaking) to be
of much use. Now, researchers at the University of Cincinnati (UC) have
developed a process to build [1]extremely long aligned carbon nanotube
arrays. They've been able to produce 18-mm-long carbon nanotubes which
might be spun into nanofibers. Such electrically conductive fibers could
one day replace copper wires. The researchers say their nanofibers could
be used for applications such as nanomedicine, aerospace and
electronics."

Freaky_Friday wrote with a link to an InfoWorld article about a
[0]teenage kid accessing customer information at AOL. The alleged
criminal trespass began late last year, and extended up through early
April. According to the article, the guy used some 'off-the-shelf'
hacking software he downloaded online to gain access to, and then
transmit information from, AOL's systems. "The complaint states that
Nieves admitted to investigators that he committed the alleged acts
because AOL took away his accounts. 'I accessed their internal accounts
and their network and used it to try to get my accounts back,' the
defendant is quoted as saying in the complaint. He also admitted to
posting photos of his exploits in a photo Web site, according to the
complaint ... If the defendant was honest about his motivation in his
reported confession, it's safe to assume that he wasn't interested in
stealing data for financial gain, [Managing director of technology at FTI
Consulting Mark] Rasch said. Still, it'll be interesting to find out what
steps AOL is taking if customer data was in fact compromised, he said."

ISurfTooMuch writes "With the furor over the impending rate hike for
Internet radio stations, wouldn't a good solution be for streaming
internet stations to simply not play RIAA-affiliated labels' music and
focus on independent artists? Sounds good, except that the RIAA's
affiliate organization SoundExchange [0]claims it has the right to
collect royalties for any artist, no matter if they have signed with an
RIAA label or not. 'SoundExchange (the RIAA) considers any digital
performance of a song as falling under their compulsory license. If any
artist records a song, SoundExchange has the right to collect royalties
for its performance on Internet radio. Artists can offer to download
their music for free, but they cannot offer their songs to Internet radio
for free ... So how it works is that SoundExchange collects money through
compulsory royalties from Webcasters and holds onto the money. If a label
or artist wants their share of the money, they must become a member of
SoundExchange and pay a fee to collect their royalties.'"

IceDiver writes "According to an article in the Toronto Star, an Ontario
company has been [0]given approval to build a 40MW solar power plant near
Sarnia in Southwestern Ontario. This is enough power for about 10,000
homes. The plant will cover 365 hectares (1.4 sq. miles) and is to be
operational by 2010. OptiSolar, the company building the plant, claims to
have developed a way to mass produce the solar panels at a dramatically
reduced cost, making the plant competitive with other forms of power
generation. 'Compared to coal, nuclear power, even wind, solar's
squeaky-clean image comes at a high price. OptiSolar is selling the
electricity to the province under its new standard offer program, which
pays a premium for electricity that comes from small-scale renewable
projects. In the case of wind, it's 11 cents per kilowatt-hour. Solar
fetches 42 cents per kilowatt hour, nearly four times as much.'"

twilight30 wrote us with a link to an article in the Globe and Mail. If
further study bears out the findings, new research into the causative
agents behind disease and cancer may have a drastic impact on the health
of citizens in Canada and the US. According to a four-year clinical
trial, there's [0]a direct link between cancer and Vitamin D deficiency.
"[The] trial involving 1,200 women, and found those taking the vitamin
had about a 60-per-cent reduction in cancer incidence, compared with
those who didn't take it, a drop so large — twice the impact on cancer
attributed to smoking — it almost looks like a typographical error. And
in an era of pricey medical advances, the reduction seems even more
remarkable because it was achieved with an over-the-counter supplement
costing pennies a day. One of the researchers who made the discovery,
professor of medicine Robert Heaney of Creighton University in Nebraska,
says vitamin D deficiency is showing up in so many illnesses besides
cancer that nearly all disease figures in Canada and the U.S. will need
to be re-evaluated. 'We don't really know what the status of chronic
disease is in the North American population,' he said, 'until we
normalize vitamin D status.'"

[0]prostoalex writes "The New York Times is running a story on a Silicon
Valley company that is playing to revolutionize the movie business. It's
no secret that the movie-going experience has been deteriorating, while
[1]the number of HDTVs sold has been rising steadily. A company called
Vudu, run by a guy who started TiVo, [2]is now building a box for
peer-to-peer download of movies straight from the studios. That could
enables the movie studios to make movies securely available to viewers on
the day of release, and improves on the download experience offered by
other shops, like Amazon Unbox, MovieLink and others: 'DVD sales began to
stagnate because studios had finally plowed through their entire backlog
of movies that could be released on the shiny discs. The success of
iTunes was also proving that the digital transition was inevitable and
that one powerful player, Apple, could control the market if Hollywood
did not find other viable partners. And outlaw services like the pirate
Web sites that use BitTorrent technology demonstrated that digital
piracy, which had consumed the music business first, now posed a real
problem for Hollywood.'"

the system are shaky. CAcert provides a web of trust. Unfortunately,
CAcert's root certificate is not in mainstream browsers. Don't you think

problems, like antitrust allegations and privacy concerns, are bad

within DoubleClick was essentially created to game the very systems the
Google search engine is founded on. '"Google is treading in dangerous
waters right now," writes Ross Dunn of WebProNews.com. Google's search
results "are supposed to be unbiased and highly relevant," but with
Performics, "Google is put into the conflicted position of trying to
generate profits by providing result-oriented organic ranking services
for its own unbiased organic search results." The worry, in other words,
is that Google's search results could be compromised by operating a
division with an interest in skewing those results in favor of clients.'
The article goes on to say how this Performics division is likely to be
sold off to make sure everything stays above board."

offer Internet voting in their [2]2008 Presidential Caucus. There were
some notable differences in generational interest: 'The YouGov poll of
almost 2,300 people, carried out on behalf of NTL:Telewest's business
unit, found that younger voters were even more positive about the idea of
alternatives to the trusty ballot box. 57 per cent of 18-34 year olds
liked the idea of evoting, but only a third of the over 55s were as
keen.' Given security and privacy concerns in the states, how likely is
this to appeal to US voters? "

Dell has always sold directly to consumers via their web site and phone
operations; it's a basic element of their business. Chairman and chief
executive Michael Dell is now conceding that the company may need to
rethink basic practices by [0]considering alternative methods of selling
their products. While initially no specifics are given, the thought seems
to be than eventually the company will begin working with a retail chain.
"Dell's direct model came under pressure as the market for PCs shifted to
notebooks from desktops last year. It is harder to custom configure
notebook computers, so they had to be manufactured in advance, which lost
Dell some of its cost advantage. In addition, consumers were showing a
preference for touching and feeling a notebook PC before buying it."
