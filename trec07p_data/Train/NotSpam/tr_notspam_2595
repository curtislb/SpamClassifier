Perhaps there is a different approach to this...  can I run a local http
server on the xo that can function as a cgi and kids can interact with the
html it produces through the browser activity?  What would the path to that
server be?  It is possible that the local library activity might benefit
from such a server to augment/complement the static html.

Regardless of how this might be implemented, for the custom rendering of
certain components (that lie outside of the HIG (e.g., a videogame)), using
javascript & canvas & html might reduce many developers' time.  Also, for
applications that are going to run on both the xo locally and the school
server, being able to use the same rendering engine might be helpful
(maintaining a consistent look and feel across all platforms).
