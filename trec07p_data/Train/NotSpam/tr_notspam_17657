I may have overstated  things a bit.

See section VIII
http://www.fda.gov/CDER/GUIDANCE/2396dft.htm

If you are analyzing data your statistical package does not necessarely
have to be validated. You may have to show that the statistical methods
are adequate/appropriate or that the results are reproduced with
different softwares if you are using non-standard packages. By all
tests, S-plus appears acceptable, do not know about R.

However, If your statistical method is an intricate part of a test, then
you do have to validate the system.
This is becoming increasingly relevant for theragnostics.

.. Which is why I said
"Should they need to use those results in a report [where] that will
matter to the FDA.."
(I added the where .. It makes more sense)

There is no such requirement.

That doesn't follow.  What matters is good statistical analysis practice

no matter which environment you use.  Note that more errors are made in 
the data preparation / derived variables stage than are made by 
statistical software.
