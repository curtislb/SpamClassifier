Well, it's not too big a block for me personally.  But for
many other people who are now starting to work on testing
the perl6 compiler or building the compiler itself, it's
hugely frustrating (and I can understand that).

For example, consider something like:

    $ cat foo.p6
    use OtherModule;   # imports some functions

    my $x = 1;
    bar($x);
    baz($x);

Someone who runs this program gets the very cryptic:

    $ ../../parrot perl6.pbc foo.p6
    Null PMC access in invoke()
    current instr.: 'parrot;Perl6::Compiler;main' pc 138 (perl6.pir:98)
    $

This doesn't give many clues about where the program is failing
(perl6.pir:98 is the location of the rethrown exception).

So, it's important (to others) but not currently a block (to me).
I'll probably come up with a workaround in PAST.pm of some sort
in the meantime.

Personally, unless fixing this is very easy/straightforward I'd
_much_ prefer to see some of the pdd15 items completed first.

Thanks!

Pm
