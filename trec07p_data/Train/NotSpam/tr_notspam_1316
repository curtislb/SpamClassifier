No, no winbindd access will produce such a tdb file.

I know - I did work on this code remember :-).

The issue some (real) customers are seeing is with laptops
(mainly I believe) going down hard - no shutdown. In that
case without the equivalent of an msync it's easy to get
a corrupted tdb state. Probably the real solution is to go
to a transactional tdb for this cache file, but I started
this code before transactional tdb existed and Volker
did ask me to finish it. I'd imagine the speed isn't
an issue but we should check.

Jeremy.
