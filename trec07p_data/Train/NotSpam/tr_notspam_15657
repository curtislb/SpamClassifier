Kai,
keep in mind not all machines in the build farm behaves perfectly.
Sometimes they just fail for reasons not related to your change.

Just examine the logs (and build history in that host) and if you are
reasonably sure it is not related to a change you made, just wait some
time (a day or so) and check later to see if anything changed.

Also some hosts are so slow that they may take several svn revisions
between tests, so make sure the fault is not due to others code.

Simo.
