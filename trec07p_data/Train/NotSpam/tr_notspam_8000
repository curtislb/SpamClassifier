Matt,

This patch actually broke stuff and was reverted shortly before Parrot 
0.4.10.  It needs to be reapplied, and then checked that it doesn't 
break anything (IIRC there were problems on Win32), hence why the 
ticket is still open.  I've only just returned from 3 weeks overseas 
and haven't had time over the past couple of months to attack the 
ticket.  If you have the tuits, go for it!  other than that, I'll have 
a go at it hopefully sometime soon (famous last words...)

Paul
