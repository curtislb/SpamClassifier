Bert,
I just want to make sure what I said is not overstated to offend
statistician who use SAS. actually, i am using SAS daily and able to
use it pretty well. ^_^
What I meant are:
1) I don't understand the mentality
2) using SAS instead of R might be related to job-security.
which is very different from "their mentality is related to job security".
