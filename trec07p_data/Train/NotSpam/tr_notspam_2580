     -  NEW BOOK ON THE UCAL BERKELEY / NOVARTIS DEAL

Some years ago in 1998, UCal Berkeley and Novartis entered into a
controversial funding deal, where Novartis gave a lot of money to UCal
Berkeley, in return for access to discoveries.  The deal had some
unusual provisions, such as giving Novartis right of first-refusal to
licensable discoveries, even some not funded with Novartis monies.
The deal has since expired, and last I looked (despite the presence of
torture-lover John Yoo), UCal Berkeley is still functioning.

Temple University Press has just released a book on the deal titled
"Universities in the Age of Corporate Science: the UC Berkeley-Novartis
Controversy", by Alan Rudy et al.  The book received a good review in
the
12 April 2007 issue of Nature.
