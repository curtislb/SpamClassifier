First, you're not going to get speech support without a program.
The screen reader puts hooks in the kernel, or catches the video in the case 
of jaws, and translates.
Next, I'd recommend USB, because, if you start using newer systems, most 
don't have a serial port.
Third, the accessibility of slackware is fine, unless you insist on running 
under gnome, x, or something else, then you're really not getting the 
benafit of linux.
HTH,
