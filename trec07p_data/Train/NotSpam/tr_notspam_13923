BSDetector writes "Apple has [0]released fixes for 17 OSX vulnerabilities,
ranging from system takeover to denial-of-service attacks. It was the
fifth security update released this year. It also marked the first time
this year that an operating system security update from Apple did not
patch a vulnerability disclosed by the January Month of Apple Bugs
project. Today's update pushed Apple's year-to-date patch total to over
100. More than one of the affected flaws were called 'critical' or
'dangerous'."

Vicissidude writes "With the expiration of a key patent, major gas-grill
manufacturers have scrambled to [0]bring infrared cooking to the masses.
The grills are still powered by propane and have traditional gas burners
that heat mostly by convection — or hot air. But they also can cook foods
with radiant heat generated by one or more infrared burners. Char-Broil
says its advanced burners operate at 450 to 900 degrees, hotter than the
450 to 750 degrees of standard gas burners. And unlike charcoal, which
can require 20 to 30 minutes to reach its 700-degree cooking temperature,
heat from the infrared burners can be adjusted quickly. Bill Best,
founder of Thermal Electric of Columbia, S.C., developed the technology
in the 1960s, primarily to give automakers a faster way to dry the paint
on cars."

[0]Roland Piquepaille writes "Using sugar contained in corn or potatoes
to build hydrogen-powered fuel cells has already been done. But now, a
team of U.S. researchers has developed [1]a new sugar-to-hydrogen
technology. Why not put the starch inside the tank of your car? With the
help of 13 specific enzymes, 'a car with an approximately 12-gallon tank
could hold 27 kilograms (kg) of starch, which is the equivalent of 4 kg
of hydrogen. The range would be more than 300 miles, estimates one of the
researchers. One kg of starch will produce the same energy output as 1.12
kg (0.38 gallons) of gasoline.' The beauty behind this idea is that no
special infrastructure would be needed. Starch could be distributed by
your local grocery store."

[0]Parallax Blue writes "The Independent is reporting new findings that
indicate a common additive called sodium benzoate, found in soft drinks
such as Fanta and Pepsi Max among others, has the ability to [1]switch
off vital parts of DNA in a cell's mitochondria. From the article: 'The
mitochondria consumes the oxygen to give you energy and if you damage it
— as happens in a number of diseased states — then the cell starts to
malfunction very seriously. And there is a whole array of diseases that
are now being tied to damage to this DNA — Parkinson's and quite a lot of
neuro-degenerative diseases, but above all the whole process of aging.'
European Union MPs are now calling for an urgent investigation in the
wake of these alarming new findings."

An anonymous reader writes "Companies are finding that this 'Web 2.0'
user participation thing sometimes isn't all its cracked up to be. The
New York Times reports on the efforts of big companies to [0]harness
consumer enthusiasm for assistance with advertising. Heinz, for example,
is running a campaign asking users to submit videos using their product
in inventive ways. The problem, of course, is that most of the
submissions are utterly terrible. The result is a headache in terms of
quality control and making use of the turned in submissions. 'Heinz hopes
to show more than five of them, if there are enough that convey a
positive, appealing message about Heinz ketchup, he said. But advertising
executives who have seen some of the entries say that Heinz may be hard
pressed to find any that it is proud to run on television in September.
"These are just so bad," said Linda Kaplan Thaler, chief executive of the
Kaplan Thaler Group, an advertising agency in New York that is not
involved with Heinz's contest. One of the most viewed Heinz videos --
seen, at last count, more than 12,800 times -- ends with a close-up of a
mouth with crooked, yellowed teeth. When Ms. Kaplan Thaler saw it, she
wondered, "Were his teeth the result of, maybe, too much Heinz?"'"

Linux applications to run — without requiring recompilation — under
Windows, Mac, or Linux, with a look and feel native to each. 'As with
Java, Lina users will first install a VM specific to their platform,
after which they can run binaries compiled not for their particular OS,

[0]Atario wrote us with a link to a New Scientist article about an
innovative new way of encrypting communications. An engineer at Texas A&M
may have a way to exploit the thermal properties of a wire to create a
secure channel. The result could be [1]an effectively impenetrable way of
securing communications, possibly outperforming quantum cryptography
keys. "In their device, both the sender Alice and the receiver Bob have
an identical pair of resistors, one producing high resistance, the other
low resistance. The higher the total resistance on the line, the greater
the thermal noise. Both Alice and Bob randomly choose which resistor to
use ... Half the time ... they will choose different [resistances],
producing an intermediate level of thermal noise, and it is now that a
message can be sent. If Bob turns on his high resistor, and records an
intermediate level of noise, he instantly knows that Alice has chosen her
low resistor, in essence sending a bit of information such as 1 or 0.
Kish's cipher does this many times, sending a random series of 1s and 0s
that can form the basis of an encryption key, the researchers say."

ISRO, Indian Space Research Organisation, is planning [0]to send a robot
for its mission to moon.. It is probably going to be made by students and
profs of IIT-Kanpur(For those who dont know, its Indian equivalent for
MIT). The two-legged robot, fitted with sophisticated sensors and
high-resolution cameras, is capable of recording information and images
using laser beams. It can also detect the distance of a hindrance, enter
a small crater, bring surface samples and return high resolution images
to the lunar vehicle. So it seems is pretty good. Although it needs some
more sophisitication the cost of it is less than $50,000. Now that a
penny infront of the obscene amounts of money NASA spends every day.
Probably that can be saved to make this world a whole lot better. Way to
go ISRO.

[0]CryogenicKeen writes with the news that a University of Michigan study
indicates the perfect place to monitor Earth's climate system [1]would be
the surface of the moon. The side facing us is a perfect location to
monitor temperatures and weather patterns here on our planet, and a UM
paper proposes an international effort to deploy monitoring stations on
Earth's natural satellite. "On the near side of the airless moon, where
Apollo 15 landed, surface temperature is controlled by solar radiation
during daytime and energy radiated from Earth at night. Huang showed that
due to an amplifying effect, even weak radiation from Earth produces
measurable temperature changes in the regolith. Further, his revisit of
the data revealed distinctly different characteristics in daytime and
nighttime lunar surface temperature variations. This allowed him to
uncover a lunar night-time warming trend from mid-1972 to late 1975,
which was consistent with a global dimming of Earth that occurred over
the same period and was due to a general decrease of sunlight over land
surfaces."
