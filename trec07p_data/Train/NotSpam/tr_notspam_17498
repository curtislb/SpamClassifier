Hi Muthiah

What is the the agreement with your institution? Do you cede the copyright to them, or do you simply archive with them, and then they license it out.

If you do not explicitly cede copyright to them then it does not matter what license they use because you can self archive elsewhere as Andres suggested IN ADDITION to archiving with them and then choose whatever license you like for this second archiving.

In other words it does not matter what license they use as long as you retain the right to the work in which case you can re-license the work in as many different ways as you desire.

I wouldn't recommend asking the archive whether you cede to them, but simply reading the agreement to see if it specifically says that you cede all rights to them, or simply what license they use.


Regards

Andrew

Subject: Re: [cc-community] Creative-Commons Copyright for Thesis

In my experience, archiving offices tend to be rather inflexible when it
comes to licensing.

I have two questions:

1. Do you have to archive with your institution? If this is a
requirement for your graduation, then do whatever you need to do and
forget about it, but choose the less restrictive option, and then
self-archive somewhere online (SSRN or with other self-archiving method).
2. If you don't need to archive with them, then self-archive under a CC
licence.

Regards,

Andres
