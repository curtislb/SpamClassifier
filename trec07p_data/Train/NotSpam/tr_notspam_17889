10:55 AM, 6/9/07, Update: Crew gears up for heat shield inspection, spacesu=
it checkout=20

The Atlantis astronauts were awakened a few minutes past 10 a.m. for their =
first full day in space by a recording of "Big Boy Toys" beamed up from mis=
sion control in Houston.

"Good morning, Houston, thanks to my wife, Michelle, and my kids for playin=
g that song," commander Rick Sturckow radioed.

The astronauts plan to spend the day testing spacesuits that will be used d=
uring three spacewalks at the international space station next week; checki=
ng out the tools they will use during rendezvous with the station Sunday; a=
nd carrying out a detailed inspection of the shuttle's nose cap and wing le=
ading edge panels.

The heat shield inspection, using Atlantis' robot arm and a 50-foot extensi=
on known as the orbiter boom sensor system, or OBSS, is a now-standard part=
 of every shuttle flight to look for any signs of impact damage that might =
have occurred during launch.

While engineers are still reviewing launch imagery, no major debris could b=
e seen in video from a camera mounted on the side of the shuttle's external=
 tank that was aimed at the ship's belly. The only damage seen so far is a =
pulled-up corner, a few inches across, of an insulation blanket on Atlantis=
' left-side orbital maneuvering system rocket pod.

"It doesn't look too bad, but we knew everybody would want to look at it do=
wn there," Sturckow radioed before the crew went to bed last night.

The re-entry environment on the upper part of the shuttle is relatively ben=
ign and the protruding blanket did not appear to be a serious issue. But en=
gineers have not completed their assessment and it's too soon to say what i=
mpact, if any, it might have. Mission managers likely will address the issu=
e at a daily news briefing scheduled for 7 p.m. to review the day's activit=
ies and the results of initial inspections.

For today's OBSS inspections, a laser sensor on the end of the boom will be=
 used to look for any wing leading edge damage that could pose a threat to =
the shuttle. The reinforced carbon carbon - RCC- nose cap and leading edge =
panels experience the most extreme heat during re-entry - more than 3,000 d=
egrees Fahrenheit - and even minor damage can have serious consequences.

The astronauts will start with the starboard, or right-side, wing leading e=
dge, making multiple passes up and down the wing to cover all the angles. A=
fter scanning the nose cap, they will move on to the port wing and repeat t=
he procedure.

For Atlantis' flight, the inspection procedures have been modified based on=
 lessons learned during the previous three post-Columbia missions. The scan=
s will take less time, cover a larger area and incorporate the use of a cam=
era on the end of the OBSS to take close-up photographs at the same time th=
e laser scanner is collecting data. With high-resolution photos in hand, fl=
ight controllers hope to avoid the need for potential "focused inspections"=
 later, if analysis of the laser data indicates any areas of concern.

The astronauts will need 75 to 90 minutes to complete the starboard leading=
 edge scan, 50 minutes for the nosecap and another 90 minutes for the left =
wing. The new scanning procedure covers most of the crew cabin as well, eli=
minating the need for separate photo scans of the cabin. All in all, the fl=
ight day two thermal protection system inspections will only take about fou=
r hours instead of six.

Here is an updated timeline of today's activities (include revision B of th=
e NASA TV schedule; in EDT and mission elapsed time):
