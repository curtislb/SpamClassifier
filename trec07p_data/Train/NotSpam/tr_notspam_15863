I am feeling a bit hounded now. I wanted to merge my net_conf
and registry globals stuff into (3_0 and) 3_0_26. I have not
managed to begin with that earlier than yesterday evening.

I don't know if these are considered major changes at all, :-)
but anyways I hope that you don't object me finishing these 
merges probably not tomorrow but in the next few days.

Good to know. Do you have plans yet as to how (from where)
3_0_27 will be branched? 3_0 or 3_0_27?

Cheers, Michael
