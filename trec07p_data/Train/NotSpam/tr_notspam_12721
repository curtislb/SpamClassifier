Thankyou both, this is a nice patch. I have some comments below ...

This looks OK. I would prefer that you pad out the dirent structures  
to guarantee a safe alignment, 8 or 16 bytes.

This looks fine too, though I think we should sort by default.

In shadow_copy_opendir(), you are still using shadow_copy_match_name  
to filter out shadow directories. It looks like this won't work  
correctly with if you specify the format parameter.

You should be able to cache the prefix created in  
shadow_copy_file_to_snapshot_path since it's quite expensive to  
create. Attaching this to handle->data should be sufficient.

Hmmm. We already use %$FOO to expand environment variables. Is it  
possible for this to get unexpected results?

Can you elaborate on the need for both a "path" and a "subpath"  
parameter? Why are they both necessary?

Could you add a comment noting this. A future enhancement might be to  
check that the share is the root of a mounted filesystem when the  
module loads.

As per the limitations noted above, these configs won't work  
correctly, no?
