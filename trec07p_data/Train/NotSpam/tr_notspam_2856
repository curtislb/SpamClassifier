HEADLINES:
PRES. BUSH MEETS WITH TOP LAWMAKERS ON IRAQ	
President Bush meets with top lawmakers today in hopes of breaking the stalemate over funding for the war in Iraq. The president vows to veto any bill that contains a timeline for the pullout of U.S. troops. And right now, that veto would be sustained. Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell says Republicans will back up Mr. Bush. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says the message he will deliver to the president is that Americans want an end to the war, not an escalation. According to Reid, “Unless he plugs his ears, he's going to have to listen.”  President Bush has said today's session won't be a negotiating session. House and Senate bargainers are working this week to reconcilediffering Iraq funding measures.

HIGH COURT UPHOLDS LAW LIMITING CERTAIN ABORTION PROCEDURE
The Supreme Court today upheld a controversial law banning a specific abortion procedure critics call “partial birth,” a ruling that could portend enormous social, legal and political implications for the divisive issue. The sharply divided 5-4 ruling could prove historic, and offer a possible signal of the new Roberts court's willingness to someday revisit the basic right to abortion guaranteed in the 1973 Roe v. Wade case. President Bush, who signed the law in 2003 and appointed two of the justices who upheld it, said the prohibition “represents a commitment to building a culture of life in America.”      But leading Democrats blasted the ruling as a rollback of reproductive freedoms. At issue in this case was the constitutionality of a federal law banning a type of abortion typically performed by doctors in the middle to late second trimester. The legal sticking point was that the law lacked a “health exception” for a woman who might suffer serious medical complications, !
 something the justices have said in the past is necessary when considering abortion restrictions.

VIRGINIA TECH GUNMAN HOSPITALIZED FOR MENTAL ILLNESS IN 2005
The student blamed for killing 30 people in one building on the Virginia Tech campus Monday before taking his own life was committed to a mental health facility in 2005 after a student rejected his attempts at establishing contact with her and authorities were told he might be suicidal, Wendell Flinchum, the Virginia Tech police chief, told reporters today. During the previous month, another female student had complained to police about Cho Seung-Hui's telephone and in-person contacts with her that she described as annoying, he said. She declined to press charges, Flinchum added. The next morning, officers discussed the matter with Cho and received a call later that day from an acquaintance who said that he might be suicidal, he said. Officers met again with Cho “and talked with him at length,” Flinchum said. Cho was asked to speak to a counselor and was evaluated by Access, an independent mental health facility in the area. “A temporary detention order was obtained and he w!
 as taken to a mental health facility” on Dec. 13, 2005, Flinchum said. Neither of the female students was among the victims of Monday's rampage that left 33 students and professors dead, including Cho.

BOMBERS STRIKE IN BAGHDAD, 171 KILLED
Insurgent bombers launched a series of attacks across Baghdad today, killing at least 171 people and wounding scores -- a particularly violent day in a bloody capital city enduring sectarian warfare and an aggressive government crackdown against insurgents. The Interior Ministry issued this update today on the violence:
-- 122 dead, 150 wounded in Sadriya market in central Baghdad;
-- 28 dead, 44 wounded in an attack near an Iraqi Army checkpoint at one
of the entrances to Sadr City;
-- 11 civilians killed and 13 wounded when a parked car bomb detonated in
central Baghdad's Karrada district, near a hospital and a market;
-- Four police officers killed and six civilians wounded when a suicide
car bomb exploded at an Iraqi police checkpoint in southern Baghdad;
-- Four people were killed and eight were wounded by a bomber targeting a
police patrol near a checkpoint in Saidiya, in southwestern Baghdad. Two of
those killed were police and the other two were civilians.
-- Two civilians killed and nine wounded when a roadside bomb detonated
at a busy intersection in central Baghdad.
It is not clear whether the attacks are linked since many insurgent groups operate across Baghdad at any point in time, but most of the attacks targeted Shiite areas. The market and checkpoint attacks, however, happened in areas where the Mehdi Army holds sway. That is the militia of anti-American Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr.

FDA EXPANDS PET FOOD RECALL
The Food and Drug Administration expanded the deadly nationwide pet food recall today to include products containing rice protein laced with melamine, a toxic agent. Before the announcement, FDA officials attributed pet illness and deaths to recalled pet food with wheat gluten found to contain melamine, a component of fertilizers and plastic utensils.       Also today, Menu Foods, the company that recalled more than 60 million cans and pouches of wet cat and dog food on March 15, added one of its Natural Life brand products to its recall list and added two product dates to eight of its already recalled pet foods. The FDA has officially tallied just 16 animal deaths related to the wheat gluten-pet food recall, while other organizations have put the death toll in the thousands. After consumer complaints to Natural Balance of Pacoima, Calif., reporting kidney failure in several cats and dogs after eating the company's venison products, the company issued the nationwide recall o!
 f its venison and brown rice canned and bagged dog foods and treats, and venison and green pea dry cat food, the FDA said. The FDA said test results show the Natural Balance products containing the rice protein concentrate ingredient were found to also contain melamine. Calls to Natural Balance for comment were not returned. Multiple pet food companies announced recalls of more than 100 pet food products after Menu Foods and the FDA announced that a wheat gluten additive from China was found to be a danger to animals. The FDA has since embargoed all shipments into the United States from the Chinese supplier of the suspect wheat gluten. The recalls have been conducted by Menu Foods, Hill's Pet Nutrition, P&G Pet Care, Nestle Purina PetCare, Del Monte Pet Products and Sunshine Mills.
