I haven't had to use DOS for some time, but DOS from Win98 is what I use, I 
forget whether it is 6.22, or 7.0.
But it has never been a problem, even with my 120 GB drive.

What DOS are you using?

Microsoft DOS had this limit:
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/118335

You'll see these limits all over the web
http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=dos+maximum+partition+size&meta=

If you're using DR-DOS or something, I wouldn't call that DOS.
Is it MS-DOS or what exactly are you running?
