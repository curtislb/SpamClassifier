(Today's top political stories from news organizations across the country)

AG STRUGGLES "TO OFFER A COHERENT EXPLANATION FOR DISMISSALS": Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales, trying to salvage
his job, endured withering questioning on Thursday from Senate Judiciary Committee members who expressed grave doubts
about his truthfulness and judgment in the firing of federal prosecutors. In more than five hours of often-combative
testimony, Mr. Gonzales, grim-faced, clasping his hands and hunched over, struggled to offer a coherent explanation for
the dismissals. He apologized for his mistakes in what he said was a flawed process, but defended the removal of eight
United States attorneys as proper. "Although the process was nowhere near as rigorous or structured as it should have
been," Mr. Gonzales said, "and while reasonable people might decide things differently, my decision to ask for the
resignations of these U.S. attorneys is justified." New York Times: Gonzales Endures Harsh Session With Senate Panel
http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/20/washington/20gonzales.html

"FASCINATION" WITH ROVE "DISTURBING AND A LITTLE WEIRD": Attorney General Alberto Gonzales sat alone at the witness
table Thursday, but another prominent official hovered over his Senate committee hearing: Karl Rove... Sen. Patrick
Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, devoted his first question to Rove, citing testimony that
Rove passed along complaints about prosecutors who "were not being aggressive enough against so-called voter fraud."
Gonzales, who said he made the final decisions on dismissals, recalled a single conversation with Rove in the fall of
2006. The White House deputy chief of staff "mentioned to me concerns that he had heard about pursuing voter fraud,
election fraud" in New Mexico, Milwaukee and Philadelphia, Gonzales testified... White House spokesman Tony Fratto
called the Democrats' "fascination" with Rove "disturbing and a little bit weird." USA Today: Rove's name keeps popping
up in Dems' questions http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20070420/a_rove20.art.htm

"THIS WAR IS LOST," SAYS REID: As Congressional Democrats sought to reconcile their differences and send an Iraq
spending bill to the White House, Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, said Thursday that "this war is lost," a
stark assessment that Republicans argued would demoralize American troops fighting in Iraq. One day after legislative
leaders met with President Bush, failing to find common ground, House Democrats signaled their intention to step away
from a mandatory deadline to remove troops from Iraq, and to work instead toward a compromise of setting a goal for
troops to be withdrawn next year. But the president said that any timetable for a troop redeployment, even a goal,
would face a veto. "I think it's a mistake, and I've made it clear, that the Congress should not have artificial
timetables for withdrawal in a funding statement," Mr. Bush said Thursday during a speech in Ohio. New York Times:
Leading Democrat in Senate Tells Reporters, 'This War Is Lost' http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/20/washington/20cong.html


BUSH TALKS IRAQ IN SMALL-TOWN OH: As the White House and Congress begin new efforts to narrow their dispute over a war
spending bill, President Bush went to small-town Ohio today to urge a friendly audience to support the fight in Iraq
and oppose congressional deadlines for withdrawing U.S. troops. In a question-and-answer session that lasted more than
an hour, Bush focused almost exclusively on the war, differentiating it from the losing and costly campaign in Vietnam.
Bush also warned, as he has frequently done, that a failure to stabilize Iraq before the United States withdraws its
combat forces would risk allowing the war to spread throughout the Middle East and allow extremists to "follow us
here." He also said that chaos in the region "could cause the Middle East to enter into a nuclear arms race." The
audience in the Tippecanoe High School gymnasium was made up of about 500 southern Ohioans invited by local chambers of
commerce and the local congressman, Rep. John Boehner, the House Republican leader. Los Angeles Times: Bush seeks war
support in small Ohio town http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-ex-bush19apr20,1,7954079.story

U.S. BUILDING THREE-MILE WALL IN BAGHDAD: A U.S. military brigade is constructing a 3-mile-long concrete wall to cut
off one of the capital's most restive Sunni Arab districts from the Shiite Muslim neighborhoods that surround it,
raising concern about the further Balkanization of Iraq's most populous and violent city. U.S. commanders in northern
Baghdad said the 12-foot-high barrier would make it more difficult for suicide bombers to strike and for death squads
and militia fighters from sectarian factions to attack one another and then slip back to their home turf. Construction
began April 10 and is expected to be completed by the end of the month. Although Baghdad is replete with blast walls,
checkpoints and other temporary barriers, including a massive wall around the Green Zone, the barrier being constructed
in Adhamiya would be the first to be based in essence on sectarian considerations. Los Angeles Times: In Baghdad, U.S.
troops build wall to curb violence http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-wall20apr20,0,5085656.story

DOOLITTLE QUITS APPROPS: Rep. John Doolittle, facing escalating legal uncertainties because of his connection to
disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff, announced Thursday he is stepping down temporarily from his position on the powerful
House Appropriations Committee. His departure, which leaves him with no committee duties, comes after FBI agents raided
his suburban Virginia home on April 13 looking for business documents belonging to his wife, Julie. Doolittle is one of
seven California House members on the Appropriations Committee. But he is the only member from the northern part of the
state and the only Californian on the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee. Sacramento Bee: Doolittle off
powerful panel http://www.sacbee.com/111/story/158268.html

RENZI FAMILY BUSINESS RAIDED BY FBI: In a second blow to House Republicans this week, the FBI raided a business tied to
the family of Rep. Rick Renzi (R-Ariz.) Thursday afternoon as part of an ongoing investigation into the three-term
lawmaker. Details of the raid on Patriot Insurance Agency in Sonoita, Ariz., were not immediately available. Renzi's
most recent financial disclosure form lists the business as an asset belonging to his wife, Roberta, and valued at $1
million to $5 million. Little is known about the inquiries into Renzi's activities, but according to media reports the
Justice Department has been running a two-track investigation into Renzi regarding a land deal, as well as a piece of
legislation he helped steer that may have improperly benefited a major campaign contributor. It was not immediately
clear which investigation the raid pertained to, and neither his attorney nor his spokesman could be immediately
reached for comment. Roll Call: FBI Raids Renzi Family Business; Congressman Leaves Intelligence Panel
http://www.rollcall.com/issues/1_1/breakingnews/18070-1.html

RENZI TAKES LEAVE FROM INTEL COMMITTEE: Rep. Rick Renzi stepped down temporarily from the House Intelligence Committee
on Thursday, after the FBI raided his family's business in connection with an ongoing federal investigation. Agents
took documents, the Arizona Republican said in a statement issued late Thursday night. "I view these actions as the
first step in bringing out the truth," he said. "Until this matter is resolved, I will take a leave of absence from the
House Intelligence Committee. I intend to fully cooperate with this investigation." Arizona Republic: Renzi steps down
from House panel after raid on firm http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/0420renzi0420.html

LEGAL STRATEGY OR JUST AN "ODD TIME TO WED?": Two Bush administration officials who have been linked in scandal are now
linked in wedlock. The union of former Deputy Interior Secretary J. Steven Griles and Sue Ellen Wooldridge could have
implications for the investigation into Griles's ties to ex-lobbyist Jack Abramoff. They were married March 26, three
days after Griles pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about his relationship with Abramoff and a previous romantic
partner. Wooldridge was the top environmental prosecutor at the Department of Justice (DoJ) before she resigned in
January. Legal experts note that people can refuse to testify against their spouses, and that in some cases, people can
prevent their spouse from testifying against them. "There have been plenty of cases where marriage was a good strategy
for a criminal defendant," said Jonathan Turley, a George Washington University law professor. But he added, "It's
plausible they simply picked an odd time to wed." The Hill: Three days after guilty plea, Griles ties the knot

BIG VICTORY IN QUEST FOR DC VOTE: A bill giving the District its first full seat in Congress cleared the House
yesterday, marking the city's biggest legislative victory in its quest for voting rights in nearly three decades.
Democrats on the House floor burst into applause, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) grabbed the arms of the
District's nonvoting delegate, Eleanor Holmes Norton, as the 241 to 177 vote was announced. "There was nothing but joy
in the chamber this afternoon, because we knew we had given this bill the kind of send-off that can get it through the
Senate," Norton (D) said later. But the bill faces considerable obstacles. Democrats don't appear to have enough votes
in the Senate to avoid a filibuster, and the White House has threatened a veto. Washington Post: House Approves A Full
D.C. Seat http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/19/AR2007041902849.html

RICHARDSON HITS THE AIRWAVES IN IA: New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson is scheduled to begin airing television campaign
ads in Iowa next week, the Democratic presidential candidate said at a party fundraising dinner in Denison Thursday.
Richardson will air two ads beginning Monday. One is a 60-second biographical look at the candidate; the second is a
30-second spot on his political career, including his foreign policy experience, aides said. The ads are intended to
increase name recognition among Iowa Democrats in the leadoff caucus state. Ads also will begin running in New
Hampshire on Monday, although Richardson said more advertising money was spent in Iowa. Des Moines Register: Richardson
will start airing ads in Iowa
http://desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070420/NEWS09/704200395/-1/SPORTS12

..AND BUYS TIME IN NH: New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson will be the first 2008 Democratic presidential candidate to air
television ads in New Hampshire. Richardson's campaign has purchased time for 60-second and 30-second spots on WMUR, a
campaign consultant has told UnionLeader.com. The ads, which start Monday, will talk about Richardson's record, his
views on Iraq and "why he's running," said the campaign consultant, who asked to remain anonymous. The ads will also
air in first-caucus state Iowa, the consultant said. He said the goal is to introduce Richardson to Granite State and
Iowa voters. New Hampshire Union-Leader: Bill Richardson takes to the air in NH http://www.unionleader.com/

SOME OF OBAMA'S DONORS HAVE LOBBYING HISTORIES: Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) has pledged to create a new brand of
politics in the Democratic presidential primary by rejecting contributions from lobbyists and political action
committees (PAC), but his fundraising records show that he relies on donors with special interests. Three of Obama's
top fundraisers, who each have raised more than $50,000 for his campaign since January, were registered as lobbyists
last year, according to reports filed with the Senate Office of Public Records. In 2006, Alan Solomont of Solomont
Bailis Ventures earned $90,000 in lobbying income; Tom Reed, of Kirkland & Ellis, lobbied for the Seismological Society
of America, the Nanobusiness Alliance, and the Airport Minority Advisory Council; and Scott Harris, of Harris,
Wiltshire & Grannis, represented Cisco Systems, Microsoft, Dell and Sprint-Nextel. All three Obama fundraisers have
said they are no longer lobbyists, although the public records office has not posted contract termination reports for
any of them. The Hill: Sen. Obama finesses his lobbyist ties

"QUIRKY" McCAIN JOKES ABOUT BOMBING IRAN: Republican presidential contender John McCain, known for having a quirky
sense of humor, joked about bombing Iran at a campaign appearance this week. In response to an audience question about
military action against Iran, the Arizona senator briefly sang the chorus of the surf-rocker classic "Barbara Ann."
"That old, eh, that old Beach Boys song, Bomb Iran," he said in jest Wednesday, chuckling with the crowd. Then, he
softly sang to the melody: "Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, anyway, ah ..." The audience responded with more laughter. His quip
was prompted by a man in the audience who asked: "How many times do we have to prove that these people are blowing up
people now, nevermind if they get a nuclear weapon, when do we send 'em an airmail message to Tehran?" AP via Yahoo!
News: McCain jokes about bombing Iran http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070419/ap_on_el_pr/on_the2008_trail

EDWARDS REIMBURSES CAMPAIGN FOR HAIRCUT$: Presidential candidate John Edwards said yesterday he is reimbursing his
campaign $800 for his "hair"-brained Beverly Hills coifs. The Democratic Edwards, who has taken fire for playing to the
poor on the campaign trail while living a first-class lifestyle, charged two $400 haircuts from Tinseltown mane maestro
Joe Torrenueva to his campaign, federal records show. The payouts touched off a furor among middle-class voters in the
heartland - people Edwards is counting on to propel his campaign - and prompted one Iowa newspaper to survey local
barbers, one of whom called the $400 price tag "preposterous." New York Post: HAIR'S YOUR $$ BACK

SANJAYA AT WH CORRESPONDENTS' DINNER: Move over Petra. Step aside Jane Fonda. Make room, Morgan Fairchild. Although all
of the major news organizations have spent weeks bragging about their big name celebrity guests, People magazine has
pulled a great coup by grabbing someone who's sure to turn more heads than anyone else this weekend: Sanjaya Malakar,
the "American Idol" contestant whose hilarious run on the reality show finally came to an end this week. People
magazine has secured the hair-challenged 17-year-old to be their guest during the White House Correspondents'
Association dinner (but he won't be at the magazine's party tonight at IndeBleu). Sanjaya earned his 15 minutes of fame
by managing to go far on the tough "Idol" show despite an obvious lack of talent (he was bolstered by campaigns led by
radio shock jock Howard Stern and such Web sites as www.votefortheworst.com. DC Examiner: Sanjaya to attend
