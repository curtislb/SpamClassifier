But surely the entire point in question is whether presenting the UI to 
someone across the network is conveying or not? GPLv3 says it isn't, 
AGPL says it is.

Perhaps it would be better (in respect of this particular question) if 
the AGPL extra clause said simply:

"Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if a user 
interacts with the program remotely through a computer network, then 
that is considered an act of conveying." (i.e. change the definition of 
conveying in section 0.)

But that doesn't prevent you *using* the modified version in your small 
embedded system. It might perhaps be inconvenient, but as Anthony Towns 
(I believe) said recently, not every obligation a license puts upon you 
is a "cost".

Or to convey it, depending on your point of view :-)

Well, those who would use the Affero GPL would see the use you are 
referring to as a form of conveying.
