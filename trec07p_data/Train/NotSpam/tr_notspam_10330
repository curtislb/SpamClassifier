Hi Andrew,

So exploring the Apache example a little more - if Apache loaded the
keytab as root when it initialized and stored it in an in-memory only
keytab so that workers didn't really have access to it, the KDC checksum
wouldn't really need to be validated and no communication with the KDC
would be necessary?
