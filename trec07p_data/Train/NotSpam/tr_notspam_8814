Editors Note:  In investing timing is critical which is why I'm
sending you this special subscription offer again.  The market
continues to act amazingly, with sellers unable to stand in the way of
a tidal wave of buy orders.  Even more interesting:

Dozens of stocks of all shapes and sizes have gapped up following
their first-quarter earnings reports, and our studies show such gaps
usually result in further upside in the weeks to come.  This week's
Top Ten sports many stocks of that ilk.  It's not too late to receive
your copy of this week's issue.  Subscribe today.

Dear Cabot Wealth Advisory Reader,

If you've been following my commentary in Cabot Wealth Advisory over the
last week then it will come as no surprise to you to learn we're in one of
the strongest, broad-based bull markets we've seen in years.

Nor should you be surprised to hear about quick investment profits of 112%
or companies that grow revenues 392%!

But look what happened yesterday!

Crocs soared 19% after reporting that revenues grew 217% in the first
quarter.

First Solar vaulted 14% after reporting that revenues grew 392% in the
first quarter.

CommScope is up 14% since I recommended it ten days ago.

And even sleepy old Schering Plough is up 4% since I recommended it a week
ago.

These are all stocks I've recommended in Cabot Wealth Advisory.  More
important, they're all stocks that first appeared in Cabot Top Ten
Report.

My message today: If you want to maximize your returns, and discover other
stocks just like these, you'll want to subscribe to Cabot Top Ten Report
so you can learn about new hot stocks before everybody else.

Top Ten subscribers who bought Crocs when it was first recommended are
already looking at profits of 112%.

And subscribers who bought First Solar when it was first recommended are
already up 46%.

Another reason to subscribe: You'll be told when to sell, so you don't see
these profits melt away when these uptrends end.

Successful investing involves both buying and selling, and in Cabot Top
Ten Report we advise you on both sides of the trade.

So try it out today!  I've arranged a special offer for readers of Cabot
Wealth Advisory, and you can access it by clicking the link below.

Should you decide you're ready to elevate your trading to a whole new
level and earn profits of 112% and more . . . then I urge you to give
Cabot Top Ten Report a try.  Click here.
