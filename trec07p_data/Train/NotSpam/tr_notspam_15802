Subject: Paths, Spaces, Getopt::Long

Hi all. I have a problem that _must_ have a very simple solution  
(that I can't find).

I use the module Getopt::Long to read arguments, one of which is a  
file path that may have spaces. The path string that is returned from  
Getopt has spaces without escape chars.  The string seems to be fine  
for Perl use, but not so great for other things, such as the Shell  
module, which can't handle the spaces.

I have to assume that paths can be converted easily for use in shells  
and such, without resorting to RegEx. Any ideas?

Mike
