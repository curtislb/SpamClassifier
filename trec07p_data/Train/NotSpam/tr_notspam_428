Hi,

I can't understand why the following regexp matches. It was part of a
larger program transformig c++ files:

When running:

#!/usr/bin/perl
"dummy dummy { ;" =~
m{(
^(
   [^;{}]
   (?>  #<--- disable backtracking
       (\s|\\\n)*                         # treat escaped \n as space
       (// ([^\n]|\\\n)* (?<!\\)\n)?   # skip // comments
   )*
 )+?
;        #<--- though there is a match, it doesn't include this semicolon
)}xs && print '$&: |',$&,"|\n",'$1: |',$1,"|\n";

I get:

$&: |dummy dummy |
$1: ||

Instead of an expected match failure.

Here is what I don't understand:
1) why does it match? Why it matches without the semicolon?
2) why $& isn't equal to $1, set to capture whole match?
3) even though ther is no //-style comment, commenting out the check
causes the match to fail.

If I reenable backtracking in the marked place, all works fine
(meaning the match fails, as expected).

I'm using perl 5.8.8, tested on Gentoo and Debian.
