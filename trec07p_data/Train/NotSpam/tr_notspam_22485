Hiya,
    I know this might be a rather elementary question for Linux people to answer.  However, I've become aware through reading the LFS book that the kernel headers are a rather important thing.  Slackware ships with 2.4.33.3.  I'm pretty sure that the kernel headers are 2.4.33.3 as well.
    All that being said, I'd like to get Speakup support with a more recent kernel.  I know I can probably download, compile, etc. something like 2.6.20 or 2.6.21.  I know also that Slackware provides 2.6.17 in Extra.  My question is: does that 2.6.17 version already have Speakup included?  If not, should I download its source code from a Slackware package site and patch it in myself?  And what about those pesky headers?
Sorry for the barrage of questions.  I'm confedent once I figure out what exactly is happening I'll be good to go.
Thanks,
Zack.
