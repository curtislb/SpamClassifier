	Should I assume you have different departments
	with different default locations and shells, all
	served from the same samba and winbindd?

Yes.  My main concern is the home directory mapping.  Currently the
shell mapping isn't an issue, but it seems reasonable to address this at
the same time.

The site, is primarily a MS windows site with over 10,000 users.  There
are six Windows 2003 Servers as the domain controllers. There are many
hundreds of OUs which represent member offices, committees, admins and
other SIGs.

If the situation were simple, the default group might have been
possible.  However, admins being admins, they frequently somehow create
accounts where the default group is domain users rather than the
appropriate group. There are cases where the default department group
isn't possible for a user such as admins or committee people.

The mapping would address our issues.  For example, a getent passwd user
would have the mapped home directory in it.

Thanks,
Wayne
