Dear All,



As all of you might know, after issuing the compulsory license for efavirenz
the transnational pharmaceutical company Merck, the US Trade Chamber and the
lobby from pharmaceutical industry are trying to thwart it. For this reason,
we consider it as being not only the health's movement fight, but also ours
as well. We are circulating a petition below, which we expect to have a
great number of signatures. Adhere to this initiative!



Please, send the signatures of your organization to clarisse@rebrip.org.br .



With solidarity,

Executive Secretariat from the Brazilian Network for the Integration of
Peoples (Rebrip)

Rebrip's Working Group on Intellectual Property (GTPI)

Brazilian Interdisciplinary Aids Association (ABIA)



Petition in support of the Compulsory License



The undersigned organizations wish to express their support for the
Brazilian government's decision to issue a compulsory license for the
medicine Efavirenz, whose patent is currently held by the transnational
pharmaceutical company Merck Sharp & Dohme. It is a historical and pioneer
decision in Latin America, owing to a process of strong, social mobilization
and resistance to abuses committed by the transnational companies supported
by the current intellectual property system.

The compulsory license of this medicine allows for the production of
affordable generic versions, which increases the population's access and
lowers the impacts of patent monopolies held by these
companies.
            We emphasize the legality and the legitimacy of the instrument
used, established both by the national legislation as well as international
trade agreements. The current system of recognizing intellectual property
not only impinges upon public health, but also upon food security and
sovereignty, biodiversity, maintaining/protecting the culture of the
peoples, access to information, and the right to communication. The recent
issuing of licenses for patented essential medicines in Brazil and in
Thailand strengthens the idea that the current model of knowledge
protection, established by WTO, does not work for our countries and our
peoples.

    We are emphatic when we affirm that a system that deepens the division
between rich and poor countries and between producers and consumers of
technological goods is neither a fair nor a viable system. The inclusion of
our signatures demonstrates that we are united in our support for the
measure taken by the Brazilian government and in our disapproval of the
naturalization of the insertion of knowledge in the roll of the
merchandises.
