04:30 p.m., 05/02/07, Update: Suttle booster segment cars derailed; NASA as=
sesses impact on downstream missions

A train pulling eight space shuttle booster segments, each loaded with soli=
d propellant and each in its own enclosed car, derailed in Alabama today, k=
nocking the locomotives and at least one segment car on its side. Five to s=
ix people on the train reportedly were injured, two seriously. Engineers wi=
th booster-builder ATK Thiokol were on the way to the scene to assess the c=
ondition of the motor segments, the first step in ultimately determining wh=
ether they are safe to fly.

The same train suffered a minor, unrelated derailment last Friday in Kansas=
, officials said, but today's incident was much more serious. Even so, a NA=
SA spokesman said the rubbery propellant in the booster segments does not e=
asily ignite and there was little risk of fire or explosion.

The space shuttle uses two solid-fuel boosters and three hydrogen-fueled ma=
in engines to push the orbiter into space. Each booster is made up of four =
fuel segments that are shipped loaded, one segment per enclosed rail car, t=
o the Kennedy Space Center from Thiokol's Utah manufacturing facility. Once=
 in Florida, the segments are inspected and bolted together. After two boos=
ters are "stacked" on a mobile launch platform, an external tank is attache=
d and then a shuttle.

The boosters are the largest solid-fuel rockets ever flown and the first ev=
er used for manned space flight. Each four-segment "SRB" generates 2.6 mill=
ion pounds of thrust and weighs 1.3 million pounds. The SRBs provide the in=
itial thrust to get the shuttle off the launch pad and only operate for two=
 minutes before exhausting their propellant, detaching from the shuttle and=
 parachuting into the ocean for recovery and eventual reuse.

The eight segments involved in today's derailment are slated for use by the=
 shuttle Discovery in October for mission STS-120 and by the Atlantis in De=
cember for mission STS-122. The goal of STS-120 is to deliver a new connect=
ing module to the international space station that will permit the attachme=
nt of Europe's Columbus research module during STS-122.

NASA officials say it's too soon to tell what impact, if any, today's derai=
lment might have on either mission. But several NASA officials said they we=
re optimistic the shuttle flights in question can stay on schedule even if =
one or more booster segments must be replaced.
