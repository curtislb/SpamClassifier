I have been collecting a few (more than a few) usability bugs and UI 
suggestions, which will hopefully be compiled to a list next month.

In the meanwhile, I would like to share a couple of ideas regarding the 
mapping of the gamepad keys [which I hope won't state the obvious too much].

Currently, the UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT keys have a fixed functionality 
regardless of the screen orientation. This isn't a correct logic, as the 
expected functionality changes according to the current orientation. I 
guess the easiest way to implement this kind of behavior would be using 
a smart key mapping mechanism in X.
Another thought -- the current input method treats those keys as 
direction keys. However, a better input method may be emulating the 
functionality of the mouse (touch pad) using the gamepad keys. In tablet 
mode this can really improve the user experience.

Just my $0.04.
