Bravo for doing all this! I really think that this is something that us in
the UK could benefit from doing too - currently both MCPS/PRS (for
collecting royalties on musical works) and PPL (for public performance of
sound recordings) take an assignment of rights, rather than a licence, and
consequently are not compatible with CC licences. John Buckman's written an
interesting article on music publishing for CC musicians which touches on
this issue - apparently it's possible for non-US musicians to register with
ASCAP (who take a licence rather than an assignment of rights) rather than a
collecting society within their own territory, in order to collect
publishing royalties. (This is of course assuming that the collecting
societies would only collect royalties on uses that do *not* fall within the
scope of the cc licence):

I've been in touch with PPL before (and not had much success in getting any
useful information out of them), and I gather other people in the UK have
spoken to MCPS/PRS about this issue, however, it doesn't seem to have made a
vast amount of difference. I'll see if we can't give it another go...

Cheers!

Tim
