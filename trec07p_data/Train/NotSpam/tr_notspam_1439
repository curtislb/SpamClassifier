Washington College of Law's

Program on Information Justice and Intellectual Property and

International Legal Studies Program



invite you to a presentation by



Thomas Faunce, Australian National University,

Sean Flynn, American University Washington College of Law

on

A Comparison of the Medicines Provisions in AUSFTA and KORUSFTA and
their Implications for Public Pharmaceutical Reimbursement Formularies



Wednesday, April 18

Noon-1:30pm, International Student Lounge, 6th Floor

Washington College of Law, 4801 Massachusetts Ave. NW, Washington D.C.



On April 1, 2007, the United States Trade Representative announced the
conclusion of a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the U.S. and the
Republic of Korea, and soon thereafter released a summary of the
agreement.  The summary of the agreement describes a pharmaceutical
chapter that appears modeled on, and in many ways appears to exceed,
regulations of the operation of public pharmaceutical reimbursement
formularies included in the 2004 Australia-US FTA.



Professor Tom Faunce is Director of the Centre for Governance of
Knowledge and Development's Globalization and Health Project. He is the
Project Director of a three year Australian Research Council Project on
the Impact of International Trade Agreements on Access to Medicines in
Australia.  Sean Flynn is the Associate Director of the Washington
College of Law and counsel to the Forum on Democracy and Trade's state
working group on pharmaceuticals and trade.
