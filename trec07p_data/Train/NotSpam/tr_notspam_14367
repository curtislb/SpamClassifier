MS censors UN document

"Microsoft asked for references to free software to be removed from a document presented at 
last week's UN World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) conference, the software 
giant admitted on Friday. The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) is unhappy that the 
document was changed and claims that even though it was on the panel discussing the 
document, it was not made aware of Microsoft's changes. The document (2.8MB PDF), 
known as the Vienna Conclusions, discusses issues around IT and creativity. The original 
draft of the document discussed how the free software model is changing the way people do 
business."
