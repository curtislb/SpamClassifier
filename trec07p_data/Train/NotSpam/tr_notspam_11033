The kernel is a complex beast. Anything you put into it can have 
unpredictable consequences on the whole. We ship the distro to millions 
of users every 6 months. Those versions all need to be maintained with 
updates for 18 months, and with LTS for 5 years. Any extra non-standard 
kernel code becomes a maintenance burden. If you have to merge in a 
security patch from kernel.org it helps if your kernel is as close as 
possible to what kernel.org was when you released. Obscure patches with 
light testing that you have applied earlier on will become a burden.

Again, that's a bug and a community like this one would do well to help 
find and resolve those. That would help a much larger, less technical 
group in the long term. That is also my main focus. I had hoped this 
highly skilled community would help me with that.

That is completely false. The way that speakup made its way into ubuntu 
originally was that a visually impaired member of our community 
suggested it for inclusion. He drew up a proper specification for it 
which we discussed at the Ubuntu Development Summit in Paris. We held a 
workshop session about speakup where I and our kernel team was present. 
There was no lack of understanding for the importance of accessibility 
anywhere in this process. (we regularly invite users and developers with 
visual impairment to our dev summits, in November we have a a whole 
mini-conference about this).

We agreed that we would include speakup in our default kernel for Edgy, 
but the maintainer expressed concerns about future maintainability 
already at that point. We agreed that we would engage with the speakup 
community and offer help with getting it into mainline. I did that, but 
nothing much came of it. For gutsy we have changed our policy to 
actively reduce the number of non-mainline patches. Speakup is clearly 
not on track for inclusion at this point and so falls under that policy.

Lots of debate. Little or no direct involvement from the speakup 
community in ubuntu to help improve our support for it or help maintain 
or move it forward.

You are not doing yourself any favours by making this into a blind vs. 
sighted issue. The blind/vi Linux community is quite numerous and could 
have a massive impact on progress in general accessibility on the 
platform and could help other weaker groups in the process. But to do 
that you have to get organised into a community structure and engage 
constructively with other parts of the free software community. That's 
how things get done in the free software world.

This list seems to be doing a god job at providing peer-help using the 
existing tools, but I see little innovation and reaching out to other 
projects going on. I don't see a roadmap or advocacy campaigns for example.

This is what I mean by 'not engaging constructively with the wider 
community'.
