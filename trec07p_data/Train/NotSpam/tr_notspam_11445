Ekkk, no. It would also be good to do a translation of the entire disc 
for the Bloc folks. I'm sure that would make them a lot more receptive 
to a position which 'should' be more closely aligned with their own. 
That is to much work for anybody.

I think however that a different letter for the Bloc, which emphasizes 
the effect on small artists. Unfortunately I only have one example on my 
disc from Quebec, and nothing which is French language.

Is there anybody who would like to contribute to this with a single page 
of French language content? Specific examples to include would be

Galerie d'Art du Petit Champlain  - http://dvd.moores.ca/other.html#theberge

Some translation of Michael Geist's points - 
http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/1536/125/

Unfortunately I don't know much that will illustrate the barriers to 
Quebec artists specifically.

cheers,
darryl
