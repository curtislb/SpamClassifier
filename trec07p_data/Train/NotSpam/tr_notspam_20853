You could do it a couple of ways the way I would go about it is

My(@arr1,@arr2,@arr3);
mol2_read($opts{m},\@arr1,\@arr2,\@arr3);

sub mol2_read {
My($opt_m,$arr1,$arr2,$arr3)=@_;

#
# code to do what you want with the above
#
       return;
}

Subject: Problems with arrays

Hi everybody,

I got a problem with handling sub-routines and arrays.

Here is an example of the code:

#!/usr/bin/perl -w

(@old_header,@old_atoms,@old_bonds) = mol2_read($opts{m});

sub mol2_read {
       return (\@mol2_header,\@mol2_atoms,\@mol2_bonds);
}

Ok, now the problem:
If I want to print the elements of the arrays @old_header, @old_atoms and
@old_bonds i see, that all arrays, that come from the sub mol2_read are
stored in only one array; in @old_header.

I want to know, how it would be possible to store every @mol-array in the
right @old-array?

Thanks for your help

Best regards

German
