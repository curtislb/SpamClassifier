I have been wrong before, I will be wrong again in the future, but as far as I can tell sas.get is still broken in the Windows version of Hmisc.  The work around that has been described several times does solve the problem.

If the sasxport.get function works for your purposes, go for it.  But if you have access to SAS and have SAS datasets that you want to use in R, I would rather import them directly than to go to the extra step of creating a sas xport file and then importing that.
