Below is a letter sent by MSF to the heads of trade delegations from India,
Brazil, the US and EU attending WTO trade talks in New Delhi 11-12 April

+++++++++++++


To the Heads of the Trade Delegations of G4 countries:

Mr. Kamal Nath, Hon’ble Minister of Trade & Commerce, Government of India
Ms. Susan Schwab, United States Trade Representative
Mr. Peter Mandelson, European Union Trade Commissioner
Mr. Celso Amorim, Hon’ble Foreign Minister, Government of Brazil

New Delhi, April 10, 2007

Re: WTO trade talks in New Delhi, 11th & 12th of April

Dear Excellencies,

We  are  writing  to you on behalf of Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) on the
eve of the G4 trade talks in New Delhi.

We   understand  that  this  round  of  trade  discussions  will  focus  on
agriculture  and  that  the  trade  delegations  from  the United States of
America,  Brazil, the European Union and India are firmly committed to find
solutions to reinvigorate the Doha Round.

We would like to draw your attention to another crucial aspect of the trade
negotiations,  notably  the  2001  Doha  Declaration’s commitment to public
health, and urge you to sustain your support for the measures undertaken by
the governments of India and Thailand to safeguard public health interests.

Public  health  interests  in  these  countries have been threatened by the
actions of Novartis, Abbott Laboratories and other actors.

The  2001  WTO Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health was a vital step
in  increasing  access to medicines. It provided unambiguous support to any
government  that  needs to protect the health of their people and therefore
use TRIPS flexibilities to overcome the barriers posed by patents.

The  AIDS  epidemic  has  most  starkly highlighted the need to ensure that
essential medicines are available at affordable prices. Today a majority of
people  in  the  developing  world who receive antiretroviral drugs rely on
generic production in India.

The  fixed-dose  drug combinations, produced in India, greatly simplify the
administration  of antiretroviral therapy and have been critical to scaling
up HIV/AIDS treatment in resource-poor settings.

India  in  March 2005 introduced a product patent regime in full compliance
with  the  TRIPS agreement. The impact of patent protection in India on HIV
programmes  is  increasingly apparent now as large numbers of people living
with  HIV/AIDS  on treatment in developing countries will need to switch to
newer, second line medicines.

These  newer  drugs  are  at  least 4-10 times as expensive as the existing
treatments,  as  almost all are patented or are likely to be patented. This
is  notwithstanding the fact that countries like India, Brazil and Thailand
have the capacity to produce generic version of these drugs.

MSF  would like to express its concerns that the interpretation of TRIPS in
keeping  with  the  2001  Doha  Declaration’s  commitment  to public health
concerns  is  now  being  unjustly  challenged  in  India  and  Thailand as
demonstrated  by  the  actions  of  companies  such  as Novartis and Abbott
Laboratories.

MSF feels that measures being undertaken by India and Thailand to implement
TRIPS flexibilities to protect public health should receive crucial support
from  the  G4  countries as a reaffirmation of their commitment to the Doha
Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health.

Today  MSF  is  treating 80,000 people living with HIV/AIDS in 30 different
countries.   Obviously,  medical  needs  of  MSF’s  patients  are  only  an
indication of the problems governments throughout the developing world will
face.

Without  the  implementation of public health safeguards agreed upon in the
2001  Doha  Declaration,  treatment  costs may increase dramatically in the
next  few  years as significant number of patients will require second-line
medicines.  It  should  also  be  noted  that  the impact of patents is not
limited  to  antiretroviral drugs, but will increasingly be felt across all
diseases with all medicines brought to market from now on.

In view of the above, we request the G4 countries to increase their efforts
to  support  access  to medicines and specifically request you to raise the
public  health  concerns  at the discussions in New Delhi and reaffirm your
commitment to the 2001 Doha Declaration.

A  statement  on your behalf,  that will support India and Thailand’s right
to  implement public health safeguards in TRIPS to address essential health
needs  by  increasing  access  to affordable medicines, will be welcomed by
millions of patients in the developing world.

We  would  be  very  happy to meet with you to discuss the issues mentioned
above in more detail.

Sincerely yours,

Thailand issues compulsory licenses for essential drugs
In the case where governments are directly involved in providing treatment
to their citizens, issuing a compulsory license for generic importation or
local production is often the only solution to solve procurement problems
and access drugs of public health importance at an affordable price. The
Thai government was confronted with similar problems and had to make the
decision on issuing compulsory licenses to solve the problem of accessing
affordable drugs for the health schemes under which their citizens,
including people living with HIV/AIDS access treatment. The licenses issued
by the Thai government authorize the procurement of affordable generic
drugs for government use overriding the patent rights of pharmaceutical
companies. The use of compulsory licenses to improve access to essential
medicines is consistent with the 2001 Doha Declaration. Notwithstanding
Thailand’s legal rights, Abbott Laboratories the Chicago-based
multinational pharmaceutical company has cited Thailand’s use of compulsory
licenses as a reason for not marketing its new medicines in Thailand.

India includes public health safeguards in its patent law
Rules of the World Trade Organization’s Agreement on Trade-related Aspects
of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) obliged India to begin reviewing
pharmaceutical patents in 2005. The TRIPS agreement, however, includes
pro-public health safeguards that countries can implement, and India has
included some of these in its patent law. India’s patent law restricts
patenting of medicines to innovations only. A crucial part of the Indian
law protects patients from the patenting of trivial improvements of known
molecules. The Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health, signed by
governments in 2001, reinforced the right of countries like India to use
such safeguards. Novartis, a Swiss pharmaceutical company has legally
challenged the specific provision in India’s patent law that restricts
patenting of medicines to innovations only. If these provisions were
overturned, patents would be granted far more widely in India, heavily
restricting the production of affordable medicines that has become crucial
to the treatment of diseases across the developing world.

SIGN MSF'S 'DROP THE CASE' PETITION

Millions of people around the world today rely on affordable medicines
produced in India.  Pharmaceutical company Novartis is taking the Indian
government to court to force a change in the country's patent law.  If
Novartis wins, a major source of affordable medicines for millions of
people across the globe could dry up.

MSF is urging Novartis to DROP THE CASE.
