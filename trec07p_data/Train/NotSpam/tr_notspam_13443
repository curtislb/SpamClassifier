The consensus is that choice-of-law is acceptable (provided it's the
law of a 'reasonable' jurisdiction)....

Haven't heard any opinion about this exclusion....

...but this is choice of jurisdiction, and many of us think this is 
*not* free. If Sun turned nasty and decided to sue me, I should not have 
to hire a *California* lawyer or fly there simply in order to defend 
myself.  This is the problematic part.  Without choice-of-jurisdiction, 
I could simply have my lawyer file a reply saying "No alleged 
infrigement took place in California, throw this out, you have to file 
suit in my home state."

This clause could be used in an acceptable manner, of course: if the 
"notice contained within the Original Software" stated that it was in 
fact subject to the jurisdiction and venue of whatever court would 
normally have jurisdiction, then this clause would really be moot.  :-)

Haven't heard much if any comment on this.

Probably OK.  Doesn't cause non-US people to be covered by export 
regulations anyway.
