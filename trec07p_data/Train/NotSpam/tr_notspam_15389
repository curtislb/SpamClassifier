<B>TONIGHT ON SHOWBIZ TONIGHT - CNN HEADLINE PRIME 11pm
ET/PT</B>

<B>PARIS HILTON: COUNTDOWN TO LOCKDOWN!</b>
Paris's pre-jail pampering! Just days before her stint in the
slammer, Paris Hilton is reportedly getting her hair and makeup
done! What!?!? The outrage over how Paris Hilton is walking the
concrete carpet like the red carpet.

<B>LINDSAY LOHAN REHAB SHOCKER</B>
Okay, so Lindsay's in rehab. And we all hope she cleans herself
up. But get this - there's still talk that she'll have her 21st
birthday party at a hot Las Vegas nightclub, right after she
gets out. Is this a joke? Linds, you may want to rethink this
one. Showbiz Tonight looks into this bizarre story.

<B>MAKING IT WORK: STARS WHO MARRY NON-STARS</B>
Happy Hollywood marriages -- is the secret for stars like Meryl
Streep, Marcia Cross and Julia Roberts marrying someone who
isn't famous? Showbiz Tonight takes a look at when  A-listers
make it work with people who aren't even on the list!

<B>KIRSTIE ALLEY</b>
You loved her in "Cheers," you didn't know what to think of her
in "Fat Actress." Now Kirstie Alley is opening up like never
before: How did she lose all that weight, and does she think
Hollywood discriminates against older actresses? It's the
interview you'll see only on Showbiz Tonight!

<b>IS THERE A KATIE COURIC CURSE?</B>
No matter which way you spin it, CBS has spent a lot of money
(we're talking-buy-your own tropical-island amounts - $15
million plus!) on Katie Couric, for a third-place CBS Evening
News newscast. So why is perky not paying off? Why are her
ratings so bad? And is there any way to turn this news
nightmare around? Showbiz Tonight investigates.
