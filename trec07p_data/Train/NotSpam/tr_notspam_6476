Hi,

I don't think there's any license which doesn't offer ASCAP or
SoundExchange collection.  If you choose an NC license you'll need to keep
in mind the nature of that license, and that you're basically saying "no"
to radio stations who earn money from advertising.  This is particularly a
stumbling block for podcasters and webcasters.

There's no way around it, you need to read the fine print of each license
and decide which one is best for you :)
