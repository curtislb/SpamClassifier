TONIGHT ON SHOWBIZ TONIGHT - CNN HEADLINE PRIME 11pm ET/PT

DON IMUS RACIAL CONTROVERSY: CENSORSHIP AND RACE
Will the firing of Don Imus lead to censorship on the airwaves?
Will there now be a fear of saying anything that could lead to
trouble? Showbiz Tonight with a no-holds barred, fired-up
debate with some of the biggest names on both sides of this
explosive issue.

SECRET STAR RELATIONSHIPS!
Some celebrities are so secretive about their relationships,
like Beyoncé and Jay-Z, Marc Anthony and Jennifer Lopez. Why
are they so hush-hush about their hookups, when other stars
aren't shy at all about showing off their significant others?
It’s a revealing Showbiz Tonight special investigation.
