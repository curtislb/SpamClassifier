						<div>Hi everyone - Gabby here.=20
<br>

<br>
We've got our second Monday edition of Inside Sport going out on BBC ONE at=
 2305 BST tonight. (I hope you caught our first Sunday morning show yesterd=
ay but if you didn't, try to tune in next week at 1130 BST, BBC TWO.)
<br>

<br>
Tonight I meet Britain's number one tennis player Andy Murray. I met up wit=
h him at the new Roehampton tennis centre and watched him knocking up with =
Tim Henman. I also met his coach Brad Gilbert.=20
<br>

<br>
I'm a rubbish tennis player so you won't see me attempting to return one of=
 those fierce Murray serves but I did work out with him and just about mana=
ged to keep up!=20=20
<br>

<br>
Andy is a really interesting guy - he spoke about his life on the tennis to=
ur, his pride in his brother Jamie's achievements, about Wimbledon and abou=
t the sacrifices he has had to make to get to the top.=20=20
<br>

<br>
Also on the programme, Britain's top paralympian, Tanni Grey Thompson is re=
tiring and we reveal one of her new goals in life - to help search out the =
paralympians for London 2012. She thinks she might find them among the serv=
icemen and women injured in action in Iraq and Afghanistan.
<br>

<br>
All that and Des Kelly and Steve Bunce to debate the hot topics of the week=
.=20
<br>

<br>
Join me BBC ONE, 2305 BST tonight.=20
<br>

<br>
<b>Gabby hosts Inside Sport on Monday 7 May, 2305 BST on BBC ONE, and secon=
d edition, 13 May, 1130 BST on BBC TWO.</b>
