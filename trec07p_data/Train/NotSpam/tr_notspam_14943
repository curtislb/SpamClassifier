Sure. If there's a collision, you may be able to do a minor DoS
by setting up two XOs with keys with the same key-ID - this will confuse
the PS on other XOs, but shouldn't be serious (the worst case is that
you can see that one or other of the colliding XOs is in an activity,
but you can't see which is there, or indeed whether it's both).

(Hmm, actually... in the current implementation, if one of the colliding XOs
is in an activity, and it leaves, then the PS (and hence UI) will
indicate that the "collided" Buddy has left, which may enable the other
colliding XO to eavesdrop undetected. I can fix this quite easily, though,
and will do so.)

Impersonating another child would require a preimage attack, as I understand it
(i.e. the ability to construct a key with a desired hash). It seems
reasonable that we don't defend against preimage attacks.

Like I said, hysterical raisins (aka "it was like that when I got
here").

The public key is represented in Telepathy by a byte-array (i.e. binary
blob) and our assumption was always that the OLPC people would put raw
key material into it. However, the presence service always appears to
pass keys around as Base64 strings, which are the contents of owner.key.pub
(which is an OpenSSH DSA public key in the same form you'd put in your
~/.ssh/authorized_keys) minus the "ssh-dss " prefix.

I think the PS should pass keys around as a binary blob of raw key material,
and the SHA-1 should be over this raw key material.

Agreed.

Hmm. I hadn't thought about having a changeable key algorithm...

OK, here's a proposal:

* The generated JIDs have a prefix ending with a dot, which is the algorithm
  by which they were generated.

* No prefix means hex(SHA-1(Base64(key material))) as we currently do.
  This is deprecated and support will be removed before we ship.

* We define a prefix to switch to now, perhaps "sha1." meaning
  hex(SHA1(key material)). We could consider switching from hex to Base32
  (which would give us JIDs half as long for the same hash length), or to a
  stronger hash algorithm, straight away. The Base32 pad character would have
  to be changed from "=" to "_" to be valid in both JIDs and object-paths, but
  that's easy. Base64 is unsuitable since the user part of a JID is
  case-insensitive.

* Everything else containing a dot is reserved for future expansion.

* The object ID inside PS is one of xmpp/some.jid@example.com (as
  currently, used for "foreign" and unidentifiable buddies),
  keyid/hexhexhexhex (for an unprefixed key, deprecated), or
  keyid/prefix/whateverwhatever (for a key with that prefix, e.g.
  keyid/sha1/hexhexhexhex).

* When coalescing contacts into buddy objects we assume the buddy will
  rarely be visible on more than one server at the same time with different
  key-hash algorithms, so continue to treat the key-hash as a unique ID.
  The failure mode if this assumption fails is that there might be two
  Buddy objects in the mesh representing the same person, but the PS as it
  exists at the moment will never cause this (it only ever connects to
  one server at a time), so I don't think we need to care.

* When we discover a buddy's full key, we hash it repeatedly, and add
  their Buddy object to the dict PresenceService._buddies once per known
  hash/encoding algorithm. Note that on Salut (link-local) we expect to either
  have someone's full key, or discover that they don't have a key, before we
  can interact with them at all.

* The server component that does the key-based authentication (which
  we haven't written yet) always has to be upgraded earlier than the XOs are,
  so it will let new XOs register with new hash/encoding algorithms.

* After the XO registers on the server, instead of storing a boolean
  "registered", it stores the JID it used. In future, it'll always log
  in with that JID.

* Should there be a process by which XOs whose JIDs use a weak hash try to
  upgrade to a better hash, by creating a new account? If so, we can avoid
  the "two Buddies" issue by making sure we log out of the old account
  before attempting to create the new one; if creation fails we can log
  back in as the old account.

* When looking up a buddy by complete public key, we try all
  non-obsolete hash/encoding algorithms (so there's value in keeping the
  number supported as small as possible).

Regards,
	Simon
