i have some suggestions for your patch.

let me start with a side point, sorry for the early tangent. why isn't
perlcritic.t using a Getopt:: module--it should be. that'd be a good
cage task, and would make one of my suggestions easier to implement.

arranging the %policies as a HoH would make it easier to add groupings
as we please. something like:
  my %policies = ( default => { ... }, extra => { ... }, );

have one flag to select which group of policies to run. the special
value 'all' would run all groups. 'default' would be the default. for
example:
  perl t/codingstd/perlcritic.t --group=extra

i should have started with this: it's a good idea. the set of perl
coding standard tests that should be passing consistently should be
run by default. and we should not have false positives (tests expected
to fail) in the trunk for any length of time, as it makes spotting
real bugs harder to do. this patch correctly addresses both those
points.
