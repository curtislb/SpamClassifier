Our mission is to (1) ensure every healthrelated innovation developed in
campus laboratories is made available in the developing world at the lowest
possible cost, and (2) increase the amount and impact of university
research on neglected diseases.

HIV-AIDS drug developed at Yale University. Since 2001, UAEM steadily spread
to over 35 campuses across the country. In the past year, this grassroots,
student-led organization burst onto the national scene.

To capture the fast-building momentum and extraordinary growth, UAEM seeks
to hire a permanent executive director and a full-time student fellow. The
Executive Director will be an energetic, dynamic, and committed individual
who works closely with the Student Board to develop and advance UAEM's
advocacy mission and to further the organization's financial and structural
growth. The ideal Executive Director will be an entrepreneur and a
visionary, someone excited about working with a group that has proven
efficacy and great potential, and building it into a powerful national
movement.

board, develop UAEM's national advocacy strategy.

leverage institutional relationships; and coordinate campaigns will allies.
..Oversee financial matters, including fundraising and budgeting.
..Help mobilize and support grass-roots student base.
..In conjunction with UAEM's student Communications Director, coordinate
UAEM's press work and other public communications.

..Be a motivated, creative leader and a self-starter.
..Have two or more years of management experience. Experience with volunteer
and/or student management specifically will be considered a significant
plus.
..Have a graduate-level degree, preferably in management. A public policy,
law, medical, science, or public health degree would also be considered a
plus.
..Have advocacy experience, including grassroots work, lobbying, and/or
press work.
..Have a proven fundraising track record.
..Have excellent interpersonal skills, especially the ability to build and
maintain strong relationships.
..Have strong writing and editing skills.
..Have a working knowledge of relevant issues, including access to
medicines, intellectual property.
..Be willing to travel and work with students around the country.
Prior membership in UAEM and/or similar advocacy organizations will also be
considered a significant plus.

This position is full-time. Location of the position is negotiable, but
preferably Boston, New York, Philadelphia, or Washington, D.C. Salary will
be competitive based on experience, with full benefits.
