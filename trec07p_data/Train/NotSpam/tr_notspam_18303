First, don't consider it a change.  We're making a new language, not
modding Perl 5.

But I think there's a very good, if obvious, reason to change ? : to
?? !!.  ? : is simply too small for the behavior of this construct.
The ternary conditional is control flow, I'd say moreso than && and
||.  It should stand out; it's one of the more important things in a
sentence.  It also has a nice pseudosymmetry with && and ||, what with
its doubled characters.

But we seem to be missing the junctional ternary conditional "? !" :-p
