Why?

Javascript, pdf, and flash all have purely accessible ways of being
accessed. PDF's especially have come a long way, flash is quickly catching
up, and javascript only causes problems during certain events where keyboard
focus is stolen away, which a lot of new frameworks have been modified not
to do. Mainly, I'm thinking of ajax and web 2.0 interfaces.

I actually think such technologies should be increased, or whatever is to
replace them. Halting progress just because certain individuals which to
keep using a console doesn't seem very practicle.

For certain activities, such as filling out forms and things of that nature:
an html equivalent to a PDF form is sometimes preferable for multiple
reasons, not just accessibility, but in the general scheme of things; it's
only getting better.

Take care,
Sina

Once you've paid for the doubletalk lt, you have at least two choices for
screen readers that will run in dos.  One of them provox was written by a
speakup list member and is free for download.  Then there's jaws for dos
also free for download since it like provox are no longer supported. 
Provox though isopen source though.  Jaws for dos has to be searched out on
the ftp links.  One more thing, if you have at least win2k you don't need
win-eyes trial anything for speech.  Thunder screen reader is available free
for download for personal home users and nvda which recently had an update
is also available free for download and it's open source.  nvda is written
in python and may get improved to where it can work with openoffice if the
interest is there among the developers.
