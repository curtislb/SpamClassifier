Hi Jeff,

Can you be more specific regarding the query duty cycle.
Do you want to read the file once and query it many times?

Can the file change during queries?

How much entries can be in such a file?

Any solution that you will decide to use will be influence from such questions.

with regards,

Yaron Kahanovitch

Subject: Query an IP from file

Hello,

I have a text file which contains lots of IPs,like:

58.253.0.0/16;
58.254.0.0/16;
58.255.0.0/16;
60.0.0.0/16;
60.1.0.0/16;
60.10.0.0/16;
60.16.0.0/16;
60.17.0.0/16;
60.18.0.0/16;
60.19.0.0/16;
60.2.0.0/16;
60.20.0.0/16;
60.21.0.0/16;
60.22.0.0/16;
60.23.0.0/16;
60.3.0.0/16;

My question is,given an IP,ie 59.32.232.33,how can I know it exists in
this file or not?
Is there a module already?thanks.
