I thought you used Y and Z for cases where Y is licensing Z's
trademark (if Y is Z's subsidiary or authorized licensee for example).
Then the trademark holder is Z but Y has certain rights to the mark.

The "if applicable" means if there is a Z. Perhaps the whole Z thing
should be taken out. "Rights to which are held by Y", and in the
document where you define Y you can explain that Y is a subsidiary
of Z or whatever.

That's what I meant. 

If you're separating the two, I don't think the word "also" in the
above is appropriate. I guess in such a case you don't want to say
more than "there's also a copyright license, go read that one, but
remember it's not a trademark license."

That word 'separately' makes it clear that this sentence is merely
an explanation and not by itself a copyright license.
