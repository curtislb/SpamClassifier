As John noted, there are different kinds of weights, and 
different terminology:
* inverse-variance weights (accuracy weights)
* case weights (frequencies, counts)
* sampling weights (selection probability weights)

I'll add:
* inverse-variance weights, where var(y for observation) = 1/weight
  (as opposed to just being inversely proportional to the weight)
* weights used as part of an algorithm (e.g. for robust estimation,
  or glm's using iteratively-reweighted least-squares).

For linear regression, the type of weights don't affect regression
coefficient calculation, but do affect inferences such as standard errors
for the regression coefficients, degrees of freedom for variance
estimates, etc.  

lm() inferences assume the first type.  
Other formulae are appropriate for inferences for types 2-4.
Combinations of types 1-4 require other formulae; this gets nontrivial.
For the 5th type, inferences need to be handled by the algorithm that
is using weighted linear regression.
