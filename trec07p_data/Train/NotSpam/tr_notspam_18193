Hello -legal,

I recently came across Knowledgetree which is a web-based document
management system.  There is a (very old) version of it currently in
Debian that is licensed under the GPL2.  However, it seems that newer
versions are licensed under what they call the KPL [ see
http://www.knowledgetree.com/KPL/KPL_License ] which is a derivative of
the MPL.

Of particular interest is the new Exhibit/Appendix B:

> KnowledgeTree Public License 1.1.1 - Exihibit B
> 
> Additional Terms applicable to the KnowledgeTree Public License.
> 
> I. Effect.
> These additional terms described in this KnowledgeTree Public License â€“
> Additional Terms shall apply to the Covered Code under this License.
> 
> II. KnowledgeTree and logo.
> This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks
> "KnowledgeTree" and the "KnowledgeTree" logos even if such marks are
> included in the Original Code or Modifications.
> 
> However, in addition to the other notice obligations, all copies of the
> Covered Code in Executable and Source Code form distributed must, as a
> form of attribution of the original author, include on each user

> "KnowledgeTree Document Management Made Simple" logo it must direct them
> back to http://www.knowledgetree.com. In addition, the copyright notice

This reads to my inexperienced eye as a particularly heavy-handed form
of the good old BSD advertising clause, which irrespective of anything
else would send this straight to non-free.

I would like to approach upstream about modifying the licensing in
accordance with the DFSG.  Not being very familiar with the MPL, aside
from this clause, what else do I need to address with them?


Thanks in advance for your help.
