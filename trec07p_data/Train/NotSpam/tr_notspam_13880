Hi,

Have a few  linux machines running here that I'd like to have running a 
directory service to synchronise login information and the like.  I was 
just wondering, what's the best directory service to run these days? I 
had to take an intro to Unix class for school, and that mentioned NIS, 
which I had looked into in the past...though I just read the ORielly 
book on that and it seemed to say that NIS should only be used until 
newer alternatives became stable, and the book was about 5 years old.  
Being able to interoperate with windows hosts would be nice also, though 
I'm not holding my breath...
Any help would be apreciated.

-- 
quit   When the quit statement is read, the  bc  processor
       is  terminated, regardless of where the quit state-
       ment is found.  For example, "if  (0  ==  1)  quit"
       will cause bc to terminate.
	-- seen in the manpage for "bc". Note the "if" statement's logic
