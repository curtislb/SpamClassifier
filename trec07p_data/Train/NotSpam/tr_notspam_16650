Is there some good documentation on LDAP? When I looked at the
documentation that came with openldap, I got lost in the weeds,
overwelmed and my head was swimming.  For whatever reason, it just
looked like complete over-kill to me.  I really don't have a good
grasp on what LDAP can do for me.  I originally thought it was a
litteral directory server like for mail and address books; that was
probably my first mistake.:)
