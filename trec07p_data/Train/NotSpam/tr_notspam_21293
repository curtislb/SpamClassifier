Hello all,
I had an idea while playing witha green machine...this may be a little 
late, I don't know. What if ther was some sort of "scratchpad" activity, 
not draw, or write,or calculator but a kind fusion of all three. 
mathimatical equasions could be typed out and then they could solve with 
typing and or drawing for their work, and they could write guides and 
picture books and such with this activity as well. Is this in 
possible/in the plans/something similar is being made???
