Subject: Net::BGP advise
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I sent [most of] the below message to Net::BGP's author a small while
ago and haven't yet heard back.  I'm hoping someone on the list can help.

I'm trying to use Net::BGP to inject a /32 into my iBGP.

What is the proper way to send a $peer->update?

If I do:

my $bgp = new Net::BGP::Process();
my $peer = new Net::BGP::Peer(
   Start =>  1,
   ThisID => '10.115.0.126',
   ThisAS => 65535,
   PeerID => '10.115.5.52',
   PeerAS => 65535,
   );

$bgp->add_peer($peer);

my $update = new Net::BGP::Update (
   NLRI       => [ qw| 10.232.210.15/32 | ],
   Aggregator => [ 65535, '10.115.0.126' ],
   AtomicAggregate => 1,
   LocalPref  => 100,
   MED        => 200,
   NextHop    => '10.115.0.126',
   Origin     => INCOMPLETE,
   );

$peer->update($update);
$bgp->event_loop;
__END__

Then the bgp session establishes, but the /32 is not injected.

If put
 $peer->add_timer(\&foo, 20);
right before $bgp->event_loop, and put $peer->update inside sub foo,
then the injection works, but I resend the update every x seconds.

I'm sure I'm just using the code incorrectly, but can't figure the
right way to do it.

Thanks!
