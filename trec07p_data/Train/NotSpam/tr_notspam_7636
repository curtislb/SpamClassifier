					</DIV><BR>
					Hello,<BR>
					<BR>
=09=09=09=09=09
						<DIV CLASS=3DRedHeading>
=09=09=09=09=09=09=09
						</DIV>
						Tonight's the night when, barring any more problems north of the bord=
er (and lets face it Scotland's natural disposition is to cause problems!) =
the political picture of Britain will finally become clear.  On our special=
 hour long edition of Newsnight we'll have the very latest results and anal=
ysis of how it all changes the way we'll be governed, and the impact the re=
sults will have on Zombie Brown's grand plans for leadership.=20
<br>
=20
<br>
Michael Crick will be in the studio with me, along with senior figures from=
 each of the parties.  The biggest upset of the night may yet be the scanda=
l over the way the vote in Scotland was conducted - both the estimated 100,=
000 ballot papers spoiled by people confused about the voting system and th=
e computer failure which has held up the vote and may have rejected ballot =
papers.  An official inquiry has just been announced.=20=20
<br>
=20
<br>
Gavin will be live from Edinburgh where any one of the possible final resul=
ts is going to cause fireworks, after Labour's worst result in half a centu=
ry. The prospect of Prime Minister Brown and First Minister Salmond, is one=
 which the former abhors and the latter relishes. In Wales, Labour may be f=
orced into coalition.=20
<br>

<br>
In England, the results that affect the majority of the UK, the complexion =
of many councils has changed as Labour has lost one after another.  Tony Bl=
air says the results are a "springboard" for a Labour victory in the next g=
eneral election, but could the Conservative's showing at the local election=
s be enough to catapult Cameron towards Downing Street - or is this as good=
 as it gets for him? And what about The Liberal Democrats - to continue the=
 momentum analogies - is Menzies Campbell on the Big Dipper after last nigh=
t's dramatic plunge in the polls?=20
<br>
=20
<br>
We'll be asking whether the Iraq war was the main reason Labour took such a=
 drubbing, and speaking to the man who wants to challenge Zombie Brown for =
Number 10, Michael Meacher.=20=20
<br>
=20=20=20
<br>
Tonight's the night for reconvening our wise and witty panel - Danny Finkel=
stein, Peter Hyman, and Olly Grender, to give the whole thing a bit of a sp=
in.=20=20
<br>
=20
<br>
Review is resting but will be back with a bang next Friday.
<br>
=20
<br>
See you tonight.=20
<br>

<br>
Kirsty.=20
