10:30 AM, 6/6/07, Update: Station spacewalk begins

Expedition 15 comnmander Fyodor Yurchikhin and flight engineer Oleg Kotov d=
epressurized the Pirs airlock module and opened the hatch at 10:23 a.m. to =
officially kick off a planned six-hour spacewalk outside the international =
space station.

The goal of today's excursion is to install 12 micrometeoroid shields on th=
e forward end of the Zvezda command module; to route an ethernet cable betw=
een the Russian and U.S. segments of the station; and to change out a hull-=
mounted experiment package. Yurchikhin and Kotov installed five debris shie=
lds last Wednesday and today's work will complete the job, giving the stati=
on's command module additional protection against potentially catastrophic =
impacts from micrometeoroids and space junk.

This is the 83rd spacewalk devoted to station assembly and maintenance sinc=
e assembly began in 1998 and the sixth this year. Going into today's EVA, 4=
6 NASA astronauts, 15 Russian cosmonauts and six fliers from Japan, Canada,=
 Germany, France and Sweden had logged 503 hours and 28 minutes of spacewal=
k time building and maintaining the space station.
