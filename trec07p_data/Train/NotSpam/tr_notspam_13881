Hi, I am using a dectalk express and was trying the grml 1.0RC1 version and 
found that dectalk express support does not work as they are still using the 
old version of the driver.  Does grml full version 1.0 support dectalk 
express or is anyone else successfully using a dectalk express with 2.6.20.x 
kernels?  Is there any plans for debian systems to use 2.6.20 as now speakup 
debian is still on 2.6.18 and gcc and other programs needed to compile a new 
kernel are not installed on my system and I don't know all of their names to 
give apt-get.
