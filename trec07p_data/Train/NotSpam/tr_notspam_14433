There is a command line option to change the frontend; you can set it to 
text; not sure if that one ships by default on netinst; i'll have to check.

Dialog does work over a serial port if the other end is a Linux terminal; 
but a bit slow to redraw screens.
The lack of serial is definitely a problem; perhaps network console is 
another option but still the reliance on modules causes problems.
