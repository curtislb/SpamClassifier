Wait, the Debian Project should clarify the intended meanings of the two
different logos, in order to inform users upfront about which uses will
be considered OK, and which will be deemed to be abuses...
I think the best place to makes things clear is the trademark notice.
That's why the whole [Z] thing was present in Nathanael's original
proposal, I think.

I simply mean "the grant of permission won't become more restrictive".

I'm not sure I get what you mean.
Let's quote the current proposed wording one more time:

| The sign [X] (hereafter "the Mark") is a trademark, rights to which
| are held by [Y] (hereafter "the Mark Holder"), representing [Z].

AFAIUI, this means that the sign [X] is a trademark that means or refers
to [Z].
The trademark license should forbid people to use [X] to mean or refer
to something that is *not* [Z].

For instance:

[X] =3D Debian Open Use Logo
[Z] =3D Debian Project and Debian distributions
Nobody is allowed to use [X] (or a confusingly similar sign) to refer to
IBM, or to Slackware, or to Microsoft, or to MacOS X, ...

[X] =3D Debian Official Use Logo
[Z] =3D endorsement by the Debian Project
Nobody is allowed to use [X] (or a confusingly similar sign) for stuff
that is not officially endorsed by the Debian Project (e.g.: unofficial
Debian builds, random Debian derivatives, my web site, ...)

Since the trademark license says that [X] represents [Z], I would say
that [X] is being misused whenever it's used to represent [T], where
[T] !=3D [Z].

Or am I using too much mathematical logic, and too little legal
expertise?   ;-)

That's why whenever we talk about trademarks on debian-legal some heavy
headscratching begins!  ;-)
