It also makes Mandarin and other ideographic languages impossible to read.  As 
evidence I admit that, though I am very smart, *I* can't read them.
(Try to ignore the billion-plus people who can.)

When (smart) people talk about Python's whitespace problem, they don't mean 
*horizontal* whitespace.

That's like saying there are too many function calls in Scheme.  Perl's an 
operator-oriented language!

You'll have to find me more than a handful of Dylan hackers to start to 
convince me of that!
