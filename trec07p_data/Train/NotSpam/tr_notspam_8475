SatCon Photovoltaic Inverters Installed at U.S. Government Facility




BOSTON, May 08, 2007 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- SatCon Technology Corporation(R)
(Nasdaq CM: SATC), a developer of power management and system
architecture solutions for the alternative energy and distributed power
markets today announced that its PowerGate(R) commercial grade inverters
have been installed as an integral part of a 375 kW building-integrated
photovoltaic (BIPV) system at the Murphy National Archives and Records
Administration (NARA) facility in Waltham, Massachusetts. The NARA
facility demonstrates a completely integrated roof and solar system--the
solar panels are the roof. The flexible, flat panel photovoltaic array
is heat-welded into the roofing material and qualifies as a "Cool Roof"
under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's EnergyStar program. 

Solar Integrated Technologies, Inc. provided the building's 143,000
square feet of integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) roofing system. SatCon's
PowerGate(R) high-efficiency inverters are a critical component of the
system, converting the sun's energy produced by the photovoltaic panels
into alternating current electricity that is used to power the facility.
To date, SatCon has shipped more the 30 MW of its industry leading
commercial grade inverters in North America. 

"SatCon is pleased to have been selected to supply the inverters for
this PV installation at this US government facility ", said Clemens van
Zeyl, President, SatCon Power Systems. "Our PowerGate(R) Inverter
series, ranging from 30 kW to 500 kW, continues to gain acceptance as
the power conditioning system of choice driven by market leading
efficiencies, simplicity of design and ease of installation " added van
Zeyl. 

"As we provide and install BIPV roofing solutions for our U.S.
customers, it is essential that we source inverters that reflect our 'no
compromise' approach", stated R. Randall MacEwen, President & CEO of
Solar Integrated. "We continue to be attracted to SatCon's PowerGate(R)
inverter and their partnership approach to business." 

This is the second large commercial installation in Massachusetts using
SatCon Inverters. Late last year, PowerGate(R) inverters were used in
the largest solar energy system installation in New England, a 425
kilowatt photovoltaic system located on an environmentally remediated
brownfield (brightfield) in Brockton, Massachusetts. Eventually the city
of Brockton plans to increase the Brockton Brightfield's capacity to 1
megawatt (MW).
