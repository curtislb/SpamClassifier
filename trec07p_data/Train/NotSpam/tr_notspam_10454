"INNOVATION AND ACCESS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE WHO
INTERGOVERNMENTAL WORKING GROUP ON PUBLIC HEALTH, INNOVATION AND
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (IGWG) AS MANDATED BY WHA 59.24"

CHRISTIAN MEDICAL COMMISSION (CMC) BRIEFING:
FRIDAY, 18 MAY 12:30 TO 14:00
ROOM XXIII (23)


Agenda

Introduction: Christian Medical Commission
Current issues in access to medicines:
Use of TRIPS flexibilities, Regulatory Matters, Litigation
Third World Network
Medecins sans Frontieres
Oxfam International

Current issues in innovation:
Alternative mechanisms to sustainably stimulate innovation consistent
with access:
Knowledge Ecology International

Moderated discussion on IGWG bringing the two together
Panellists :  	Dr. Ahmed Ogwell, IGWG Bureau, and Ministry of Health,
Kenya
  		Mr. Peter Beyer, Intellectual Property Office, Switzerland

National conflicts in pharmaceuticals have potentially serious
implications for the entire global community, and bring governments,
acting on behalf of their respective constituencies (poor, rich,
industrial champions, the marginalized etc), into stark conflict with
each other.

At the same time creative new approaches are being put forward for
dealing with the crisis in innovation - including frameworks for R&D,
mechanisms for the collective intellectual property assets and
alternative financing models for rewarding innovation.

The WHO took an important step in recognising that problems of access
and innovation have to be dealt with together if either was to be
addressed effectively. 

So how does the IGWG bring these sets of issues together? Can it? What
more needs to be done?

Join us for discussion
