Well, if you licence the musical work with BY or BY-SA, then the radio
stations have the right to play your track *without* any obligation to pay
royalties through ASCAP, as the CC licence grants them permission to use the
work commercially anyway. If you licence BY-NC-SA, then commercial uses are
reserved from use under the terms of cc, and can therefore be licenced
through ASCAP, and renumerated.

Bear in mind that NC doesn't mean that third parties can *never* use your
work commercially, simply that they have to seek permission (or obtain
another licence, such as an ASCAP public performance licence) before doing
so.

IANAL, ATINLA.

Cheers,

Tim
