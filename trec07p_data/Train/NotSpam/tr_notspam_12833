Hello sm1lies,

TopCoder and Yodlee have paired up to bring you Single Round Matches well worth competing in.  Not only will you get a chance to improve your rating, but you'll also have a chance to chat with a Yodlee representative about their employment opportunities and cash prizes are being distributed to the winners of the matches!

***Yodlee will be giving away $5,000 per match!***

Think financial services is boring? Think again. At Yodlee, we're taking a whole new look at what the Internet can do to transform the way people access, manage, interact with, and transact upon their finances to enable greater insights, control, and 'action'. Come join our revolution...
 
Yodlee today powers online and mobile financial solutions used by nearly 8 million consumers at more than 30 of the top 50 global financial institutions. At Yodlee, you will be working with the latest Web 2.0 technologies, building out a complex infrastructure to support millions of payments and transactions each day across a rapidly growing global network, built from scratch by Yodlee. As an ASP with stringent up-time requirements and enormous scalability and security issues, Yodlee offers unique challenges for developers. Our systems have to scale from mere hundreds to 10s of millions of users. We don't run vast datacenters - our systems have to provide speed, with minimal hardware, and support half a million e-Commerce sessions per hour with sub second response times. 
 
If you're looking for an environment where innovation and creative approaches are valued, where there are no boundaries for what can be accomplished, and where your work will ultimately transform the online experience for millions of people, then look no further. Yodlee is the place for you!

Don't forget about the first SRM that Yodlee will be sponsoring on Tuesday, May 29 at 7:00 AM EDT (GMT/UTC -4).  The chat session will start one hour prior to the match. Yodlee will also be the sponsor of SRM 345 on June 14 and SRM 357 on July 12.

Best of luck to you in the arena!
