I don't think that this is an accurate description of the discussion.
See  http://lists.debian.org/msgid-search/euei2j$qqc$1@sea.gmane.org

I do not remember any conclusion in this direction.
Draft3 is better than the horrors of the previous drafts, but I am
currently still *unsatisfied*.

I think it would have been better to discuss how the FSF can fix the
remaining issues of the GPLv3-draft3.

Or front cover texts, or back cover texts, or dedications, or any other
unmodifiable parts whose name I cannot remember now.

I would love to have a telepathy device, but unfortunately I don't.
How can you know the actual reasons why people voted the way they did
for GR-2006-001?  I even asked (on debian-vote) to the last DPL
candidates to explain the rationale behind their ballots for GR-2006-001
and only some of them (including you) answered: that makes some 4 or 5
explanations; what about the rest of the Debian Developers who voted or
didn't vote for that GR?

I would be really surprised if Debian actively promoted the GFDL...
The winning option of GR-2006-001, though being absurd and ill-phrased,
stated quite clearly that the GFDL has issues and should be recommended
against.

When was the CDDL accepted as a license that meets the DFSG?!?
I can remember some discussion where no real consensus was reached.
See
http://lists.debian.org/msgid-search/20061203173038.4cc1cc59.frx@firenze.li=
nux.it
as a summary.

The simplest solution is persuading Sun to relicense (or dual-license)
OpenSolaris under a GPLv2-compatible license.
Sun publicly claimed to have understood the importance of
GPL-compatibility when they started to release their Java implementation
under the GPLv2: I don't see a valid reason that could block such a
relicensing or dual-licensing.

I don't think that what you gathered reflects debian-legal contributors'
opinions.  And I am disappointed that you contacted us so late.  :-(
