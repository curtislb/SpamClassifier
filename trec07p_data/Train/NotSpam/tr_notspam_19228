Paulo,

I have run into similar problems when wanting to work with multiple
seasonality. You are probably already familiar with the work by James Taylor
in this area. I contacted him and he was kind enough to share some of his
(Gauss) code, and I have tried to implement it in R, but due to my lack of
programming skill I don't really trust the results and it is very slow. I
will try to get it to the point where it could be useful for others.

best,

Spencer
