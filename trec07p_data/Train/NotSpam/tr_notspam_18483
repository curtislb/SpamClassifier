						<B>MEDIA</B>
<br>

<br>
The media is a "feral beast" and its relationship with politicians is "dama=
ged". The words of Tony Blair today who decided to devote one of his last s=
peeches as Prime Minister to the idea that the media is creating cynicism. =
He says we need to separate "news" and "comment". Do let us know what you t=
hink <a href=3D"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/newsnight/2007/06/tuesday_12_jun=
e_2007.html"><b>here</b></a>.  And see if we cast "heat" or "light", as the=
 PM describes it, as Michael Crick reports on the speech and Jeremy Paxman =
hosts a debate on the issue.
<br>

<br>
<B>FORD</B>
<br>

<br>
Paul Mason will be reporting news and collecting comment on Ford's admissio=
n that it is looking to sell Jaguar and Land Rover. But we hope he'll also =
answer the question - would the two British car brands be better off owned =
by private equity than the stumbling American car giant.
<br>

<br>
<B>WOOLMER</B>
<br>

<br>
The latest from Jamaica is an admission from the police that Bob Woolmer wa=
s not murdered but died of natural causes. After acres of media coverage - =
both broadcast and print - that claimed the Pakistani cricket team were pri=
me suspects we'll be talking to their representative.
<br>

<br>
<B>EGYPT</B>
<br>

<br>
Finally, is Egypt turning into a police state? The BBC World Service Arab a=
ffairs analyst, Magdi Abdelhadi, has a disturbing film about how advances i=
n democracy are being reversed.
<br>

<br>
Tonight, 10.30, BBC2.
