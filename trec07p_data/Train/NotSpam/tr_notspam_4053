Well, sorry. I thought the rounding was obvious. But obviously I was wrong.  
Some macros for rounding up are for sure a good thing. The packfile code has 
some more rounding up like this.

Re magic numbers: yes the 8 is an arbitrary measure to reduce the needed free 
list slots.

The register memory needs FLOATVAL alignment. The macro ALIGNED_CTX_SIZE takes 
care of this. Hrmpf. another rounding up thingy ;)
