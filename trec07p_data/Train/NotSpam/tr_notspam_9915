If it's a license derived from the GNU GPL, it cannot refer to the GPL
terms, but must copy and modify them instead.
And it cannot be named GPL or mention GNU.

See  http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#ModifyGPL

It's not what has been done by Red Hat.
They licensed their work under the GNU GPL v2 + additional restrictions.
This is different from licensing under a FooBar license derived from the
GNU GPL v2.

That is the problem!

It's not clear at all, because it is self-contradictory.

In section 6 of the GNU GPL v2, it's clearly stated that no further
restrictions *beyond the ones found in the GPL terms* can be imposed.
But such restrictions are imposed, at the same time.

That case is not a invalid license, it's a copyright violation, which is
a different beast!
