Hi Scott,

I am by no means defending MS who clearly over-reached in this instance
but the document in question wasn't to my knowledge published by the UN
and at most would have had a UN logo somewhere alongside a bunch of other
logos from other financial sponsors...

So my guess is that the document has more or less disappeared.  The recent
de facto endorsement of open source by the UNDP (in fact I believe it was
by something called APDIP which is sponsored by the UNDP) is a far more
important and long lasting development with practical results on the
ground especially in Asia.

There has been a lot of other to-ing and fro-ing around MS and OS in
various UN post-WSIS venues but the story is too long and tangled and my
memory too selective to follow it... Do some searching on WSIS and IGF
(Internet Governance Forum) and MS and see what turns up.

Good luck with it,

MG
