I think I am missing something. Doesn't everyone get the right to redistribute 
the track non-commercially?

Ah, read the article. So you get to choose to sit on it or give it out 
non-commercially.

OK, mish mash time... What is to stop an artist putting a song up on ebay, 
with a reserve if desired, winner get's the honour of giving the track to the 
world on a BY-SA basis.

Or, as above but the winner gets rights to license the work out on a non-Sa 
basis as well. (A right shared by the author and each seperate from the 
other.) (I would expect this to go for more than the first example.

I might try this idea out if I can find a way to get an ebay account.
