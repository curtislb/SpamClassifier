Hello to all on the Speakup mailing list! I was wondering if the latest 
release of Ubuntu Feisty or whatever the latest version of Ubuntu is for the 
desktop system contains Speakup in it's kernel?
Also, though this is off topic somewhat, when I tell Speechd-up to set -t at 
bootup, where would the configuration files be on Ubuntu for Speechd-up, and
also: How would I set it?
Dontinittables with dash signs in between each word? Like this:
dont-init-tables=1 (Notice the equals sign)
Or would I set it without dash marks? (Wich syntax to use?)
Like this:
Dontinittables=1?
I need to know this as soon as possible.
Regards, --Keith, KeithNet Network Administrator
