That was misleading advice.  R is a C program and accesses the environment 
via the C calls getenv and (on Windows) putenv.  This is not Windows 
scripting (Grothendieck's earlier reference): the C runtime maintains only 
one environment block.

I've re-checked, and suspect the problem is in the following comment in
?download.file

      These environment variables must be set before the download code
      is first used: they cannot be altered later by calling
      'Sys.setenv'.

If I have http_proxy set in the environment, the proxy is not used in any 
of the following cases:

- Calling R from a shortcut with http_proxy="" on the target (see the 
rw-FAQ).

- Calling R from a shortcut with no_proxy="*" on the target.

- Using Sys.unsetenv("http_proxy") right at the start of the R session.

- Using Sys.setenv(no_proxy="*") right at the start of the R session.

If you set options(internet.info=0) you will see exactly what is tried.

Another possibility is that R is being used with --internet2, in which 
case none of this applies, and the simple answer is not to use --internet2 
at home.

If there were other variables affecting it, I would think my deleting 'http_proxy' in the OS would also have no effect -- yet it does.

I have, for work, a User environment variable "http_proxy" which I set in the OS (Windows XP Pro).  When I am at work, and I try to retrieve data from the web with 'read.csv', things work just fine.
