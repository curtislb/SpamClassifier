Making news today...

* President Bush's job-approval rating is 38% in the latest USA TODAY/Gallup Poll, taken last Monday through Thursday.
"His standing has stayed below 40% for seven consecutive months."

"[W]hile dismal," the 38% figure "represents an improvement - his strongest standing this year." (USA Today)

* On CBS' "60 Minutes," Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) stepped back from recent remarks about relatively safe areas of
Baghdad:

"Of course I'm going to misspeak and I've done it on numerous occasions and I probably will in the future... that's
just life, and I'm happy frankly with the way I operate, otherwise it would be a lot less fun."

* "We're not going to vote to cut funding, period." - Sen. Armed Services Chairman Carl Levin (D-MI), speaking about
Iraq on ABC's "This Week."

* Mike Huckabee took a shot at Mitt Romney's hunting record on CBS' "Face the Nation":

"I think it was a major mistake to try to portray himself, 'I've been a lifelong hunter,' when he's been twice.  It
would be like me saying 'I've been a lifelong golfer' because I played putt-putt when I was 9 years old and I rode in a
golf cart a couple of times."

* ON CNN's "Late Edition," Sen. Joe Lieberman (I/D-CT) criticized House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's trip to Syria last week:
"I believe her visit to Syria was a mistake, that it was bad for the United States of America and good for the
Syrians... We're in a war against the Islamist terrorists who attacked us on 9/11/01. Syria is a state sponsor of
terrorism."

* After his own Sunday show appearance, Newt Gingrich told reporters at a stakeout: "I think this entire U.S. Attorneys
mess is the most self-destructive mismanagement I've seen in the years I've been here... This has been so mismanaged
that I really think they need an entirely new team at Justice."

* Meanwhile, Alberto Gonzales "has virtually wiped his public schedule clean to bone up for his long-awaited April 17
testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee," but "even his own closest advisers are nervous about whether he is up
to the task."

"At a recent 'prep' for a prospective Sunday talk-show interview, Gonzales's performance was so poor that top aides
scrapped any live appearances." (Newsweek)

* And White House contender Tom Tancredo has made Duane Chapman (AKA "Dog the Bounty Hunter") "a part of his
presidential campaign."  Why?  Find out in Hot Topics below!

President's Schedule:

* The president travels to Arizona for a 12 pm ET tour of the Yuma Sector Border.  Bush will make 1:25 pm ET remarks on
comprehensive immigration reform at the U.S. Border Patrol's Yuma Station HQ.

Stewart."

Political Hot Topics
(Today's top political stories from news organizations across the country)

STUCK UNDER 40%: President Bush is reaching levels of consistency that no White House would want. Bush's job-approval
rating in a USA TODAY/Gallup Poll taken Monday through Thursday is 38%. His standing has stayed below 40% for seven
consecutive months. Since the advent of modern polling, only two presidents have suffered longer strings of such low
ratings. One was Harry Truman, whose popularity sank during the final 26 months of his tenure as the Korean War
stalemated. The other was Richard Nixon during the 13 months leading up to his resignation amid the Watergate scandal.
"It's pretty hard for a president to get ratings this low in general, and then to be in the position where you
basically don't budge - that's been reserved for some of the least popular presidents during the worst times of the
last 60 years," says Jeffrey Jones of the Gallup Poll, who analyzed the historic data. USA Today: Bush's approval
rating sits below 40% http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-04-08-bush-approval-rating_N.htm

"FRESH SPEECH," RENEWED PUSH ON IMMIGRATION: President Bush will relaunch his push for an overhaul of the nation's
immigration laws today in Arizona, with a fresh speech on the border and a new congressional leadership that is
friendlier to his views, but with the same dynamics that scuttled his last attempt: a cooperative Senate but bipartisan
opposition in the House. In contrast to her approach to other controversial issues, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi
(D-Calif.) has told the White House that she cannot pass a bill with Democratic votes alone, nor will she seek to
enforce party discipline on the issue. Bush will have to produce at least 70 Republican votes before she considers a
vote on comprehensive immigration legislation, a task that may be very difficult for a president saddled with low
approval ratings. Washington Post: President Renewing Efforts on Immigration
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/08/AR2007040801260.html

DEMS WON'T "CUT FUNDING, PERIOD," SAYS LEVIN: Two leading Senate Democrats said their party will not cut off funding
for U.S. troops in Iraq, distancing themselves from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat, who now says he
supports doing so. "We're not going to vote to cut funding, period," said Sen. Carl Levin, Michigan Democrat and Armed
Services Committee chairman. Mr. Levin said he and other Democrats would continue to pressure President Bush on
enforcing benchmarks for progress in Iraq, but ultimately most of his colleagues will support funding because they do
not have the votes to override Mr. Bush's veto... Sen. Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, echoed Mr. Levin's
comments on troop funding, telling "Fox News Sunday" that "We are not going to leave the troops high and dry, plain and
simple. Senator Reid has said that. I've said that. Every leader of the Democratic Party has said that." Washington
Times: Senate Democrats say they won't halt funding for troops

DEMS SEEK TO "UPSTAGE" GOP WITH ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX CHANGE: House Democratic leaders, in an effort to upstage
Republicans on the issue of tax cuts, are preparing legislation that would permanently shield all but the very richest
taxpayers from the alternative minimum tax, which is likely to affect tens of millions of families as early as next
year if it is left unchanged. The effort, which lawmakers emphasize is still in its early stages, would exempt millions
of people from the tax but would have to come up with a way to offset an enormous loss of revenue in the next decade.
Measured in dollars, it would be far bigger than Democratic initiatives to provide money for children's health care,
education or any other spending program. New York Times: Democrats Seek to Lead the Way in Tax Overhaul
http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/09/business/09tax.html

GINGRICH CALLS FOR "NEW TEAM" AT DOJ: Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich on Sunday became the latest Republican to
criticize Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales for the dismissals of eight United States attorneys, and he said Mr.
Gonzales should consider stepping down. "This is the most mishandled, artificial, self-created mess that I can remember
in the years, in the years I've been active in public life," Mr. Gingrich said on "Fox News Sunday." "You know, the
buck has to stop somewhere, and I'm assuming it's the attorney general and his immediate team," he said. Asked whether
Mr. Gonzales should resign, Mr. Gingrich replied, "I cannot imagine how he is going to be effective for the rest of
this administration." New York Times: Gingrich Faults Gonzales for Attorneys 'Mess'
http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/09/washington/09attorneys.html

"HE'S NOT READY": Attorney General Alberto Gonzales has virtually wiped his public schedule clean to bone up for his
long-awaited April 17 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee - a session widely seen as a crucial test as to
whether he will survive the U.S. attorney mess. But even his own closest advisers are nervous about whether he is up to
the task. At a recent "prep" for a prospective Sunday talk-show interview, Gonzales's performance was so poor that top
aides scrapped any live appearances. During the March 23 session in the A.G.'s conference room, Gonzales was grilled by
a team of top aides and advisers—including former Republican National Committee chair Ed Gillespie and former White
House lawyer Tim Flanigan- about what he knew about the plan to fire seven U.S. attorneys last fall. But Gonzales kept
contradicting himself and "getting his timeline confused," said one participant who asked not to be identified talking
about a private meeting. Newsweek: Gonzales Crams for a Senate Grilling

GOP MAY HAVE A LAPTOP PROBLEM: When Karl Rove and his top deputies arrived at the White House in 2001, the Republican
National Committee provided them with laptop computers and other communication devices to be used alongside their
government-issued equipment. The back-channel e-mail and paging system, paid for and maintained by the RNC, was
designed to avoid charges that had vexed the Clinton White House - that federal resources were being used
inappropriately for political campaign purposes. Now, that dual computer system is creating new embarrassment and legal
headaches for the White House, the Republican Party and Rove's once-vaunted White House operation. Democrats say
evidence suggests the RNC e-mail system was used for political and government policy matters in violation of federal
record preservation and disclosure rules. Los Angeles Times: GOP-issued laptops now a White House headache
http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-na-laptops9apr09,0,4563806.story

McCAIN ONLY TOP-TIER '08-ER WHO'S SERVED IN UNIFORM: The 2008 presidential campaign is long on war rhetoric and short
on warriors. Despite the high-profile roles of the battle against terrorism and conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan in
the presidential campaign, few of the candidates can claim military experience on their resumes. Of the top tier of
2008 candidates, only Republican John McCain has been to war and served in uniform. Yet, while the demand for a
president with a military background might be expected to run high in the post-Sept. 11 era, few see that as a
determining factor in the 2008 race. AP via Yahoo! News: Most '08 candidates lack military record
http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070409/ap_on_el_pr/military_background2008

RICHARDSON IN NORTH KOREA: Bill Richardson, the New Mexico governor who has undertaken diplomatic missions to countries
at odds with the United States, began a rare visit to isolated North Korea Sunday to recover remains of American
servicemen killed in the Korean War. The four-day trip, which has been endorsed by the Bush administration, comes days
before a crucial deadline in a recent nuclear disarmament accord. Earlier, Richardson, a Democratic candidate for
president, had said he had no intention of negotiating nuclear matters. On Monday, Richardson met with North Korea's
top nuclear negotiator, who said his government would immediately invite U.N. nuclear inspectors into the country if
$25 million in disputed North Korean funds are released to Pyongyang. AP via Yahoo! News: Richardson on rare visit to
North Korea http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070409/ap_on_re_as/north_korea_richardson

EDWARDS COURTS UNIONS: For John Edwards, the road to the presidency runs through Alan Young, a teachers' union official
in Des Moines, Iowa. The former North Carolina senator's strategy for winning the Democratic nomination is to knock off
one of the two front- runners, Senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, in the early primudles and make the next
round a head-to-head contest. To do that, he is focusing his campaign efforts on labor. "One thing union members know
how to do is organize," Edwards, 53, who sought the presidential nomination in 2004 and then became the Democratic vice
presidential choice, said in an interview last week. Bloomberg: Edwards Bets on Union Support to Grab Momentum in Early
Races http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=washingtonstory&sid=aZgxe2qBSz7M

"TENNESSEE MAFIA" WOULD JUMP BEHIND THOMPSON BID: If Fred Thompson decides to run for president, he will have some
powerful supporters: The self-described "Tennessee Mafia," a group of Republican politicians from his home state
well-versed in the craft of national campaigns. What the actor and former senator may lack is the financial juice that
fired the group for more than a quarter century, driving local and national campaigns with astonishing amounts of cash.
"Mafia" members include Howard Baker, a former Republican senator, ambassador and White House chief of staff, who
himself ran for president in 1980; Sen. Lamar Alexander, a former two-term Tennessee governor who ran for president in
1996 and 2000; and Bill Frist, the former Senate Republican majority leader, who considered, then rejected his own run
for the White House for 2008. Wall Street Journal: For Thompson, Delay Is Costly http://www.wsj.com/link/thompson

HUNTER'S SON WILL RUN IN CA-52: Duncan Duane Hunter's goal of winning the San Diego-area congressional seat that his
father will vacate after 14 terms has one new, major obstacle: He probably won't be able to campaign personally. Mr.
Hunter, a 30-year-old Marine who has served two tours in Iraq, last week was recalled to active duty and expects to be
in Iraq or Afghanistan when the election to replace his father, Republican presidential aspirant Rep. Duncan Hunter,
occurs. But regardless of where his April 15 deployment orders send the artilleryman, he's still committed to running
and representing his father's longtime constituents. Washington Times: Hunter's son to run for dad's seat
http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20070409-122614-7542r.htm

TANCREDO BACKS "DOG": Call it the "Dog" plank in the presidential platform of Rep. Tom Tancredo, R-Colo. The
conservative congressman has been at the forefront of the effort to prevent the extradition of bounty hunter and
reality TV star Duane "Dog" Chapman and his brother and son to Mexico on a deprivation of liberty charge. Now, Tancredo
has made it a part of his presidential campaign. Tancredo recently sent a letter to the Mexican government protesting
the action, and his campaign site now sports a form that allows users to add their name to the letter and "let my
congressman know how I feel." DC Examiner: 'Bounty Hunter' becomes part of Tancredo's White House bid

OBAMA GETS A BOOST FROM CLINTON "DEFECTORS": Hundreds of New Yorkers are reaching into their wallets to bankroll
Democrat Barack Obama's 2008 presidential bid - including many longtime boosters of arch rival Hillary Rodham Clinton.
In fact, Obama's biggest campaign bundlers in the Big Apple - credited with rounding up Democratic ducats in mammoth
chunks - are former big-time Clinton backers who have shifted their allegiance from the hometown senator to the soaring
newcomer. The support of ex-Clintonites has helped the Illinois upstart nearly tie her in the so-called first primary -
the three-month fund-raising quarter that ended March 31. New York Post: N.Y.'S BARACK $TARS
