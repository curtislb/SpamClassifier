1. Now that your Taxes are Filed, What do you do if you receive an IRS Notice?

Throughout the year – but particularly following April 15 – the IRS sends http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=108531,00.html letters and notices to taxpayers requesting payment, notifying them of account changes, or requesting additional information. 

If you receive correspondence from the IRS, review it, compare it with your return and follow the specific instructions for resolving the inquiry.

2. Business or Hobby? IRS Explains the Difference and Implications for Deductions

FS-2007-18 http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=169490,00.html explains the rules for determining if an activity qualifies as a business and what limitations apply if the activity is not a business. 
Incorrect deduction of hobby expenses account for a portion of the overstated adjustments, deductions, exemptions and credits that add up to $30 billion per year in unpaid taxes, according to IRS estimates.

3. IRS’s Taxpayer Assistance Blueprint Focuses on Taxpayer Services

Last week, the IRS submitted its Phase II Taxpayer Assistance Blueprint to Congress http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=169427,00.html.

The plan includes specific recommendations for improving IRS services. Improving taxpayer service is an important part of a comprehensive strategy to reduce the “tax gap” by helping taxpayers understand and meet their tax obligations.
