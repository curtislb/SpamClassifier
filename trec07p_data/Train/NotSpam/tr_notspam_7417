> Hiya,
>     I got to thinking this morning of a feature of Speakup which, I admit,
I've been sort of taking for granted lately.  It's the attribute reading
key--speakup+keypad period.
>     What I'm wondering about is how, exactly, Speakup gets information on
the colors of the console, or of certain text therein?
>     This is an issue which seems on the whole to be fairly complicated
under a Windows system: I've yet to really find a screen reader which will
duplicate it.  I'm wondering, then, how Speakup does it?
> Thanks much for indulging me,
> Zack.
