I have been surprised to find how much you can get done in SQL, only transferring summudles of the data into R.  There is soon going to be an 
experimental "surveyNG" package that works with survey data stored in a SQLite database without transferring the whole thing into R for most operations (and I 
could get further if SQLite had the log() and exp() functions that most other SQL implementations for large databases provide). I'll be submitting a paper on 
this to useR2007.

The approach of transferring blocks of data into R and using a database just as backing store will allow more general computation but will be less efficient 
than performing the computation in the database, so a mixture of both is likely to be helpful.  Moore's Law will settle some issues, but there are problems where it is working to increase the size of datasets just as fast as it 
increases computational power.
