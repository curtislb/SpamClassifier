Hi Eben --

Yes.

Etoys has external formats for its "documents", so they can be stored 
on servers, fetched, passed around, etc. We have tried 3 different 
approaches over the years (and all work currently). One of the 
approaches uses the Open Doc standard (where the scripts are in there 
as non-standard data). The format we are using now is a form of 
s-expressions (could be XML, but XML is really too verbose for the XO 
and for slow networks).

And, as I mentioned in the previous email, when on an XO itself, all 
the media objects could be integrated as collections of frame-less 
X-windows (or some similar but simpler mechanism).

Etoys (and, better, an improvement in Etoys that has more age range) 
could be done in Python by writing a parser for one of the file 
formats and making the Etoys graphical environment and control in 
Python. This would completely unify these ideas on the XO -- but 
something more like the integrated architecture for many kinds of 
media objects would still have to be created.

In other words, Etoys per se are not nearly as important as the ideas 
and access to authoring power for children that they implement.

In any case, we are gradually working on the next version of an Etoys 
like environment that deals much more richly with more of the 
important issues for  children's authoring than we do now.

Cheers,

Alan
