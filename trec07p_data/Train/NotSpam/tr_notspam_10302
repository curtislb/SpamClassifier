TONIGHT ON THE CBS EVENING NEWS
<http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/eveningnews/main3420.shtml>=20

Here's an early look at what we are working on for tonight's broadcast
of the CBS Evening News from Anchor and Managing Editor, Katie Couric...


Hi everyone,=20

The merger of Daimler and Chrysler was one of the most expensive - and
least fruitful - in American automaking history. Now DaimlerChrysler is
dropping its struggling Chrysler Group, which is getting picked up for
$7.4 billion by a private equity firm. Anthony Mason will have the story
of Chrysler's sale and Nancy Cordes will look at what's pinching
American automakers, from union costs to pensions and sales numbers.=20

Turning to Iraq, we'll have two stories. First: the anatomy of an
ambush. Mark Strassmann will report on the abduction of three American
soldiers in Saturday's early morning hours south of Baghdad. He'll break
down what happened and the effort to get the missing soldiers back.=20

And it has been reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 barrels of
Iraq's oil has been unaccounted for - that's every day for the past four
years. Our Sharyl Attkisson asks why - was it corruption, smuggling or
simply poor accounting?=20

Cycling great Floyd Landis opened his doping hearing denying the charge.
He also criticized the testing procedure used by the Tour de France,
Bill Whitaker will report.=20

As for health news, I'll talk with our Dr. Jon LaPook about the
surprising study that shows the number of women older than 40 getting
mammograms is on the decline. It is the first time the rate has fallen,
according to the National Cancer Institute.=20

And I'll wrap-up our broadcast with the first piece in a series we've
been working on called "Gotta Have It: The Hard Sell To Kids." I'll take
a look at the multitude of ways cartoon characters and other faces our
kids and grandkids love are used to market everything from junk food to
exercise. Experts say there's more at stake here than just money.=20

I hope you'll join us. Katie=20

TUESDAY MORNING ON THE EARLY SHOW
<http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/earlyshow/main500202.shtml>=20


Harry Smith, Julie Chen, and Russ Mitchell anchor THE EARLY SHOW from
New York. Hannah Storm anchors from Las Vegas, NV. Dave Price will bring
us the weather.=20

Along with the top news of the day, we will also have the following
stories:=20

EATING DISORDERS AND MODELS: Ever since eating disorders contributed to
the deaths of two super skinny South American models last year, the
fashion industry has examined standards that force models to fit into
clothes most women can't wear. For now, thin is still in but EARLY SHOW
National Correspondent Tracy Smith has the story of a designer who's out
to change that.=20

BEST YOU CAN BE: BAGS OF SUMMER: With the rise of spring, summer cannot
be far and fashion's hottest accessory very well may be the handbag. But
what are the best picks for every occasion? Whether you are looking for
a carry-all to tote all of your belongings, or a slim clutch for a night
out on the town, choosing a bag that suits you does not have to be a
difficult affair. Kim France, Editor of Lucky magazine, will join us
Tuesday morning with her top picks for summer.=20

HIGH SOCIETY: SUBSTANCE ABUSE: Joseph A. Califano, Jr. served as Lyndon
B. Johnson's domestic affairs chief and Jimmy Carter's secretary of
Health, Education, and Welfare, where he started the nation's first
national anti-smoking campaign. In 1992, Califano founded The National
Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse. Now, he has written, High
Society, a detailed look at how substance abuse ravages America and what
we can do about it. Substance abuse has touched every family in some way
and Tuesday morning Califano will join us with more.=20

VINCE GILL: Country star Vince Gill's latest album, These Days, is a
four-CD set of 43 new and original songs, blending traditional country
and bluegrass, jazz and rock 'n roll. Vince recently turned fifty, and
is showing no signs of slowing down. Tuesday night he will be performing
at the Academy of Country Music Awards where he is nominated for three
awards including Album of the Year. Tuesday morning, Vince will join our
own Hannah Storm live from Las Vegas.=20

HOME THEATER: CAGNEY AND LACEY: 25TH ANNIVERSARY: It has been
twenty-five years since Cagney and Lacey first captured our attention
solving crime. Now, a special DVD has been released showcasing Season
One of stars Sharon Gless and Tyne Daly's adventures. Tuesday morning,
we'll take a look at the special features the DVD offers and Sharon
Gless and Tyne Daly will stop by our plaza for a trip down memory lane.=20

TONY NOMINATIONS: The nominations for the 61st Annual Tony Awards will
be announced live from the New York Public Library for the Performing
Arts. Actors Jane Krakowski and Taye Diggs will announce this year's
nominations. The 61st Annual Tony Awards will take place at Radio City
Music Hall on June 10th.=20

JOSH TURNER PERFORMS: Josh Turner has become one of country music's
brightest young stars since Long Black Train, his critically acclaimed,
platinum-selling debut album hit shelves in 2003. For his sophomore
effort entitled Your Man, which debuted at number one on the country
music charts, Josh dug deeper into his South Carolina roots to display a
more mature side. He's also nominated for three Academy of Country Music
Awards Tuesday night, including a nod for Song of the Year for Would You
Go With Me. He will join us Tuesday morning to perform his hit song Me
and God.=20
