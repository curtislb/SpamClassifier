 Hi Nataniel,

A quick and easy way to do this is to run a decision tree analysis (like 
chaid) or discriminant analysis using the cluster variables you used as the 
predictors and the cluster membership as the outcome variable.  The decision 
tree will highlight in a monotonic sense which variables in respective order 
drive the clusters into groups. The algorithm is upside down in a sense, but 
it does help to identify what is driving your clusters apart.

This might help to identify the bigger differences in some of the groups

Remember when comparing cluster groups you need to look at differences 
between the groups and also the standard deviation (dispersion around 
clusters)
