Hi,

I want to store the output of following command:
"vcover merge outfile in1 in2"

I tried :
1) @result = `vcover merge outfile in1 in2`;
2) system("vcover merge outfile in1 in2 > @result");

I can see some error displays on the screen. But these are not getting 
stored in @result.

Kindly please suggest some way to store it.

NOTE : script runs on linux m/c

Thanks,
Divya
