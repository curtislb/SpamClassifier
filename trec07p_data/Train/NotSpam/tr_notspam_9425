Here is the text on medicines from the outline of "A New Trade Policy for
America" announced yesterday by Speaker Pelosi.  Note that this is still
an outline - I have not yet seen the actual text:


Generic Medicines
-  Change the "data exclusivity" provision (period in which a generic
manufacturer may not use clinical test data of an innovative drug
manufacturer) to allow generics to enter the market more quickly than
under the old provision (by having "concurrent period" of data
exclusivity).
-  Include exception in FTAs that the "data exclusivity" provision does
not preclude FTA countries from taking measures to protect public health
and from utilizing the WTO "health solution."
-  Eliminate requirement that a drug regulatory agency withold approval of
a generic until it can certify that no patent would be violated if the
generic were marketed; strengthen and expedite judicial processes in
countries to ensure patent rights of innovative drug companies are
respected.
-  Eliminate requirement that an FTA country extend the term of a patent
on a pharmaceutical product for delays in the patent and regulatory
approval process.  Instead, ensure expeditious patent and regulatory
approval process.

> WASHINGTON -- After months of standstill, the White House and
> congressional Democrats agreed to strengthen labor and environmental
> standards in free-trade pacts, signaling a new bipartisan consensus
> aimed at shoring up crumbling U.S. public support for economic
> globalization.

> The agreement -- announced last night by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi,

> congressional leaders are feverishly negotiating to try and reach an
> agreement this month on immigration overhaul.
>
> While the trade pact has the solid backing of congressional leaders,
> any specific trade legislation could still face strong opposition among
> rank-and-file lawmakers and labor groups.

> The push for free trade has been complicated by the rising U.S. trade

> deficit surged to a six-month high of $63.9 billion in March, party
> because of a jump in oil imports. The report is causing economists to
> scale back estimates of first-quarter growth -- and is fueling new
> criticism from Democratic lawmakers of the Bush administration's trade
> policies.
>
> The deal would require that core international labor standards be
> incorporated into trade pacts and would enforce those commitments with
> the same sanctions used to back up business-backed priorities. In the
> case of Peru, the changes will be accomplished through amendments that
> won't require already agreed-to texts to be reopened, a congressional
> official said. The Panama deal, though largely completed, was left open
> to accommodate any compromise that might be struck by the White House
> and Democratic leaders.
>
> The agreement isn't meant to open U.S. laws to challenge under the
> strengthened labor commitments. But it doesn't include a specific
> assurance against that, according to the congressional official.
