I was on a Delta flight this morning, and the in-flight movie that was
playing was a new British romantic comedy called Starter For 10.  It's
setting was Bristol University for the 1985-6 school year, and it had two
Kate Bush references.
1. Near the beginning, Brian and his two pre-college buddies are on a pier
and one fellow pulls out "The best tape I ever made!" to put in their jam
box. It's all Kate, but we never hear it because the other buddy grabs it
and throws it off the pier.
2. On New Years Eve, Brian and Rebecca are starting to get it on, and Kate
singing The Man With The Child In His Eyes on a record in the background,
when Rebecca says "We can't start 1986 listening to this moaning!" and they
put on a different record. (This is just before Brian calls Rebecca Alice
and ruins his chances)
.
Regards,
Neal Mulvenna
