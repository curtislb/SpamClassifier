Hi what I want to know is how come speakup is not part of the base line
kernel?  It seems to be a problem every time a new kernel comes out.  If
speakup was infact included in the base line kernel it seems to me every
distro would pick it up.

 That would be useful, however speakup as it currently stands, will not 
work with 2.6.22, period, no matter what distro does or does not ship 
it, or no matter what script is set up to grab it all and glue it 
together.
