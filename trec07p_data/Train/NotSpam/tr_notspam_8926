Only very tangentially related, but I found it funny that Andy Griffith
failed in a suit against a politician who had changed his name to Andy
Griffith and said things like "they never did that in Mayberry", but
there was deemed to be no confusion about the famous Andy endorsing the
new Andy, and 
        
        federal dilution law expressly exempts "[n]oncommercial use[s],"
        and use in a political campaign should be considered
        noncommercial

So there you have "what does NC mean" outside the CC NC context. :-)
