The Honorable Susan C. Schwab
U. S. Trade Representative
600 17th Street, N.W.
Washington, DC 20508

Dear Madam Ambassador:

We are writing to request that you release the full text of the
U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement (the "Agreement") to Members of Congress
immediately. We are now past the midpoint in the 90-day period provided
by statute for Congress and U.S. private parties to evaluate a trade
agreement prior to the President signing it. Unfortunately, the text of
the Agreement remains secret and has been made available only to a
relative handful of individuals in the private sector and in Congress.

Since announcing the Agreement, Administration officials have made a
number of statements to the press characterizing the Agreement, and
asserting that it is the largest and most important free trade agreement
since NAFTA. Until the text of such a significant agreement is released
to Congress, we are unable to conduct our requisite oversight function.
We believe Members of Congress play a vital role in discussing issues
that may arise under the Agreement, and now is the most appropriate time
to address such issues. Further, it does not make sense to us for the
Administration to be soliciting support from Members of Congress if the
Administration has not released the text to the American people.

In addition, we remain deeply concerned with the auto provisions based
on industry reports because of the apparent failure to include in the
Agreement the Bipartisan Congressional Auto Proposal, conveyed to the
President by our letter of March 1, 2007. Release of the text is overdue
- and concerns among our and other offices extend well beyond the
critical auto provisions.  All members of Congress are entitled to a
meaningful chance to review and comment on the Agreement.  Consequently,
we strongly urge you to release the text of the Agreement to all Members
of Congress without further delay.

The Honorable Charles B. Rangel
The Honorable Sander M. Levin
The Honorable John Dingell
The Honorable Dale E. Kildee
The Honorable Ellen O. Tauscher
The Honorable Bobby Rush
The Honorable Carl Levin
The Honorable George V. Voinovich
The Honorable Evan Bayh
The Honorable Debbie Stabenow
The Honorable Candice S. Miller
The Honorable Thaddeus McCotter
