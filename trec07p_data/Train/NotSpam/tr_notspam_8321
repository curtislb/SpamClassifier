HEADLINES:

PRES. BUSH APPROVAL EDGES UPWARD
President Bush's approval rating is 38 percent, according to a fresh poll carried out over the weekend.  That’s up 2 points from what it had been last month and 6 points above its all-time low in April 2006.  The CNN/Opinion Research Corporation telephone poll of 1,028 adult Americans -- about evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats -- has a sampling error of plus-or-minus 3 points.

TOP SUNNI: MAKE CHANGES BY NEXT WEEK OR ELSE
Iraq's top Sunni official has set a deadline of next week for pulling his entire Sunni bloc out of the government -- a potentially devastating blow to reconciliation efforts within Iraq.  In an interview with CNN, Iraqi Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi said he will step down and pull his 44 Sunni politicians out of the 275-member Iraqi parliament unless key amendments to the Iraqi constitution are made by May 15. He also said he turned down an offer by President Bush to visit Washington until he can count more fully on U.S. help.  Al-Hashimi said he wants guarantees in the constitution that the country won't be split into Sunni, Shia and Kurdish federal states, which he says would disadvantage Sunnis.  "If the constitution is not subject to major changes, definitely, I will tell my constituency frankly that I have made the mistake of my life when I put my endorsement to that national accord," he said.  Al-Hashimi's cooperation with the government of Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri !
 al-Maliki is considered essential if there is to be a realistic chance of bridging the Shiite-Sunni divide in Iraq -- one of the key goals of the Bush administration.  The withdrawal of the Sunni bloc would unravel months of efforts to foster political participation by Sunnis in Iraq's government. It would also further weaken al-Maliki just weeks after Shia cabinet ministers allied with Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr bolted from the government.

TRAPPED SURVIVOR FOUND AS DEATH TOLL RISES TO 12 AFTER KANSAS STORMS
The death toll from the weekend's tornado-packing storms in Kansas rose to 12 today when authorities found the bodies of two more victims in Greensburg.  Previously, officials had said eight people died in Greensburg; that total rose to 10, said City Administrator Steve Hewitt.  Another person died Friday night in Stafford County to the northeast, and one died Saturday night in a separate tornado-packing storm in Ottawa, Kansas.  Authorities also found a survivor buried beneath the rubble in Greensburg.  "Last night, late evening, we did recover someone alive," said Ronald Knoefel with the Kansas Highway Patrol.  "So we are very very happy with that.”  Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius tells CNN the rubble was so deep in some places that even trained dogs might be unable to pick up the scent of people who may be buried beneath.

SUBDUED N.J. GOV. CORZINE RESUMES DUTIES
More than three weeks after he was almost killed in a high-speed crash on the Garden State Parkway, a subdued Governor Jon Corzine resumed his constitutional duties as governor today.  "I'm not going to be hightailing it all over the state to the four corners for a while," the 60-year-old governor told reporters from a chair outside Drumthwacket, the official residence of the governor, in Princeton.  Corzine said his doctors checked him out on Friday and gave him the OK to return to work, and his lawyers and staff agreed he was "sharp enough" to re-assume his duties.  Corzine said he will focus first on preparing a budget, which is due in six weeks. "It's time for me to get to work," he said.  And as he has before, Corzine apologized for not having worn a seat belt. "It was a thoughtlessness and carelessness that I didn't apply to this part of my life," he said.

WITH RACE JUST BEGUN, GIULIANI, MCCAIN AND CLINTON, OBAMA IN LEAD
A year and a half before the 2008 presidential election, Rudy Giuliani and Senator John McCain are leading the Republican pack, and Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama are leading the Democrats, a fresh poll says.  Asked whom they would most likely support for the Republican nomination, 25 percent of people who identified themselves as Republicans or leaning Republican cited the former mayor of New York and 23 percent cited the senator from Arizona.  Former Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee, who has not said he is running, was cited by 13 percent; former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney by 10 percent; former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich -- who has not said he is running -- by 9 percent; former Virginia Governor Jim Gilmore by 3 percent; former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee by 2 percent, Colorado Congressman Tom Tancredo by 2 percent; former Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson by 2 percent; California Congressman Duncan Hunter by 2 percent; Congressman R!
 on Paul of Texas by 1 percent.

Among the Democrats, the senator from New York was cited by 41 percent versus 27 percent who said they favor her rival from Illinois. That's a significant boost for the former first lady over the 30 percent rating she got in a poll carried out April 10-12.  Former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina was cited by 14 percent; New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson by 6 percent; Senator Joseph Biden of Delaware by 3 percent; Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut by 2 percent; Congressman Dennis Kucinich of Ohio by 1 percent. Six percent said they had no opinion.
