Yeah maybe I am over-concerned here :)

Well, deleting negative cached entries is not a big deal, you are going
to return a missing mapping anyway without hitting the backends, so the
behavior should be the same. But I am ok with your change.

Sure, make sense to me, I just needed some more explanation and I think
you are right here. Thanks.

Simo.
