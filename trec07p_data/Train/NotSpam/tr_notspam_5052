HEADLINES:
House Majority Leader: “Solution in Iraq is a Political Solution”
Today, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer on told reporters "the solution in Iraq is a political solution."  This after the commander of U.S. forces in that nation briefed Hoyer and other House members on the four-year old war there.  After listening to General David Petraeus, Hoyer said he thinks the fight in Iraq is not against al Qaeda but is "a virulent sectarian battle against various factions within the Iraq populous that has not been brought under control by the Iraqis themselves."  Meanwhile, House Minority Leader John Boehner told reporters his take of the briefing was that progress had been made in Iraq but there are still "challenges ahead."  Boehner told reporters Petraeus discussed the "Iranian influence in Iraq," which Boehner called a "big source of sectarian violence." The general, he said, explained Iranian munitions and training has been fomenting violence among the various factions there.  According to Boehner, Petraeus "feels good" about the progress and p!
 erformance of the U.S. troop reinforcements and the Iraqi forces, but feels "there is a lot more that needs to be done by the (Iraqi) government."

House Committee Votes to Subpoena Rice over Africa Uranium Claim
The House Oversight and Government Reform committee issued a subpoena to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice today in an effort to find out what she knew about the claim that Iraq sought uranium from the African country of Niger.  The panel approved the subpoena on a 21-10 vote.  The uranium claim was mentioned in President Bush's 2003 State of the Union address and was a key element in the administration's case for the invasion of Iraq.  Rice was President Bush's national security adviser at the time.  In July 2003 -- two months into the Iraq war -- the White House backed away from the uranium assertion after a former diplomat, Joseph Wilson, announced the CIA had sent him to Niger in 2002 to check out the report. Wilson said he found it unlikely to be true, and alleged the Bush administration had "twisted" the evidence for war.  Today, Deputy State Department spokesman Tom Casey said that the department "will be consulting with the White House on this matter."  He said Ric!
 e has addressed "this four-year-old issue on many occasions and the subject already has been exhaustively investigated."

Rep. Hunter Calls for Reid to Step Down Over “War is Lost” Remarks
Today, Congressman Duncan Hunter called for Senator Harry Reid to resign his post as Senate majority leader over remarks that the senator made last week that the war in Iraq "is lost" if the United States continues on its current policy.  Hunter, a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, is the ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee.  "In my opinion Senator Reid, having made that statement, which can only have a demoralizing effect on our troops and an effect of encouragement of the adversary, I think it would be appropriate for Senator Reid to resign his position as the leader of the United States Senate," he said.  Reid made his remarks Thursday, prompting an angry backlash from Republicans.  "I believe myself that the secretary of state, secretary of defense and -- you have to make your own decisions as to what the president knows -- (know) this war is lost and the surge is not accomplishing anything as indicated by the extreme violence in Iraq!
  yesterday," said Reid, Democrat of Nevada.  Reid defended his remarks this week in an interview with CNN, saying he agrees with General David Petraeus, commander of U.S. troops in Iraq, when he said that the war in Iraq cannot be won militarily and must include political and diplomatic measures.

Tornado Slams Texas-Mexico Border Community; 10 Dead
Authorities in the southwest Texas border town of Eagle Pass have largely completed search-and-rescue operations in the wake of a powerful tornado that crossed the U.S.-Mexico border, killing 10 people, and are turning their focus to cleaning up the debris and wreckage left behind and aiding the survivors, a county official tells CNN.  The tornado killed seven people in Texas and three in Mexico as it uprooted mobile homes and battered buildings.  A family of five -- including a young girl -- was among those killed in the rural area south of Eagle Pass, when their mobile home was blown from its foundation and into an elementary school, City Councilman Ramsey English Cantu tells CNN.  Texas Governor Rick Perry toured the damage, Maverick County Judge Jose Aranda tells CNN.  At least 80 people were injured by the strong tornado, including four who sustained serious injuries and were evacuated to a medical facility in San Antonio, Texas Chief of Emergency Management Jack Colley!
  tells CNN.

Dow Hits New Mark
The Dow industrials jumped nearly 136 points today to close above 13,000 for the first time as investors hailed upbeat earnings from Amazon.com, possible asset sales by Alcoa and a strong reading on the economy.  The gain in the Dow Jones industrial average -- up 135.95 to 13,089.89, was equal to about 1 percent. The blue-chip index also hit a new intraday high of 13,107.45 during the session.  The broader S&P 500 was up 15.01 to 1,495.42, also 1 percent, and ended at a six-year high. The Nasdaq was up 23.35 to 2,547.89, a gain of 0.9 percent, and ended at a six-year high.  Treasury prices slipped, the dollar rose versus the yen and the euro, oil prices jumped while gold ended lower.
