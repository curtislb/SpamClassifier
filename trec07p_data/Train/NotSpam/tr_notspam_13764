Hi,

I'm not sure if I good understand but if you need install Debian then
you have several possibilities:

- netinst 

this Debian installation image offer you install with brltty support.
You need only say in prompt on beginning of installation:

install brltty

This image you can find on debian.org

- bootstrap

You can install on Debian another Debian to same or other disk on same
machine or on some mounted FS. The package called debootstrap. See a man
page.

- live CD

You can use some speaking live cd based on Debian and the install with
debootstrap or copy the live CD.

Best.
