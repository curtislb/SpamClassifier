  Could you author a sample letter that people could be encouraged to
send to their own MPs to encourage them to look at the DVD?   You want
to somehow encourage MPs to look at this stuff.

  As you'll note, I wrote a letter for the FLOSS MP package that the
GOSLING group sent.

  I am wondering if you have contacted the folks at Appropriation Art to
see what their thoughts are, given that much of this so-called "illegal
art" is appropriation without permission (stuff that should be
considered Fair Use, but might not be currently).


BTW:  I hope that for a label for the DVD you will use 09-F9-...  ;-)
