When visiting that website, I saw no evidence that it was being used to
promote the official CDs -- I saw only the official logo standing alone on
the page, which to me looked like it's being used to promote the site, not
the official CDs themselves.

If he's selling official CDs (which, as I said, was not at all obvious to
me), then there's no reason to go C&D'ing anyone here, but there's at least
room for improvement in the labelling which I hope he would be amenable to
working with Debian on (given a clear and authoritative statement on
Debian's behalf, that is).
