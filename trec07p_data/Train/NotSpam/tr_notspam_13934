There are no real solutions except:
* boycotting one of the licenses (easy to tell which one) whenever you have
  the chance to do so (ie, mostly as upstream)
* bashing the FSF until they merge GPL and GFDL

Of course, as a maintainer you usually can't do anything but complain, or
look the other way at contamination incidents.  Which are quite common --
even "foo --help" is likely to be one.  And looking the other way, while
popular, can't be called the most sound advice...
