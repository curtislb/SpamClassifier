We have this breaking news into the Showbiz Tonight newsroom:

Showbiz Tonight has learned that actor Alec Baldwin, in a taping of ABC's "The View" which airs Friday, says he wants out of his contract on NBC's "30 Rock" in order to spend more time with his family.  Baldwin, who apologized for the nasty voicemail left for his 11-year-old daughter, also said he could not care less if he ever did television again.
How does Alec Baldwin intend to break his contract?  And what does NBC have to say about this?  Find out on TV's most provocative entertainment news show, Showbiz Tonight, 11pm Eastern and Pacific, on CNN Headline Prime.
