I can't remember that I said that you shouldn't separate your
expressions (by punctation/whitspaces),
$.but! (*adding$ %*characters _+that^# &$might) @#not_ !#be()
!&necessary_ *#$doesn't! *(make) !@_it$ =_easier
to read and to type (in addition it was a torture to type that).

Oh, I thought Perl was a programming language. My fault.
Apples and oranges.
Most modern scripting languages don't need the semicolons. I think
there's no plausible reason for them.

I don't think that it's a point of ignorance.
Especially as they (and enough other people on the web) only seem to be
ignorant regarding Perl. Strange, huh?

I never claimed to have some.
