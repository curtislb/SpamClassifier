I've done a couple of installs via the old serial tty approach. There are 
still a lot of howtos out on the web for this but briefly, what you need to 
do is attach a null modem cable to the serial port on the target machine, 
connect the other end to a machine that already has speech and fire up a 
terminal emulator program on  that machine.  At the boot prompt, type 'linux 
console=ttyS0,9600n8'. There are lots of variations on what you'd type at 
the boot prompt so consult the howtows.
