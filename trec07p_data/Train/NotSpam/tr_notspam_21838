Didn't you mean most dos doesn't support ntfs?  Yep, There is a limit on 
file size, but I rrestore often from my large 80gig partitions which are 
fat32.  Dos reads them fine, you just have to keep each file smaller 
than 2 gig.  Image for dos or image for windows does that fine.  I need 
to figure out a good way to back up my i r l p Linux box, would like to 
just mirror the drive which has 3 partitions--just in case.
