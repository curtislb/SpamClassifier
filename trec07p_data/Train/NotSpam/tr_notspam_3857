I have set up a 32bit chroot environment as is described here:
https://alioth.debian.org/docman/view.php/30192/21/debian-amd64-howto.html#id292205

That has the advantage that I can use it for any 32bit-only application,
so I have a 32bit iceweasel which works with flashplayer, a 32bit xine
to play movies which need proprietary w32codecs, I can run Adobe reader
if necessary, etc. You can set this up so that it is completely
transparent to the user; I followed the "schroot-wrapper" approach
described in the link.
