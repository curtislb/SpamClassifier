I'm afraid that I don't follow that, unless you're saying that some of the
levels of the factor have very few observations in them.

If the response is ordinal, then you can use sem() with
polyserial/polychoric correlations. Otherwise, the sem package won't handle
it.

As I said, neither tsls() nor sem() will handle an unordered response.
