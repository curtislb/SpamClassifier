According to a story on News.com, [0]legal online gambling may return to
the US. The ban, [1]put into place last year, is now in jeopardy thanks
to the efforts of folks like Barney Frank, the Democratic chairman of the
House Financial Services committee. Frank is of the opinion that adults
should police themselves for excessive gambling, and the government
should stay out of their way. "Friday's hearing included witnesses from
companies that process online payments. In general, they echoed the
arguments once used in favor of ending alcohol prohibition and that are
now being invoked to decriminalize marijuana: It's better to legalize,
tax and carefully regulate an industry than let it flourish with far less
oversight in the black market. Some countries already do just that. In
the United Kingdom, for instance, Internet gambling is legal and strictly
regulated. Some of the larger online casino operators are publicly traded
on the London Stock Exchange. "

[0]forkazoo writes "Space.com is reporting the [1]successful launch of
the space shuttle Atlantis. There were no major incidents or problems
during the launch, except that there was some concern about the weather
at the two European abort landing sites. The weather cleared up and the
launch was pretty much perfect. 'Preliminary analysis of images taken by
onboard cameras revealed expected "popcorning" foam loss during ascent
but none that appeared to strike the orbiter. NASA has kept a close watch
on the shedding of fuel tank foam insulation during shuttle launches
since the 2003 Columbia accident, which claimed the lives of seven
astronauts, and made modifications to reduce the amount of debris shed
during liftoffs.' The launch was broadcast live [2]NASA TV stream."

[0]Teksty Piosenek writes "Artists and record bosses believe that the
best album is the loudest one. [1]Sound levels are being artificially
enhanced so that the music punches through when it competes against
background noise in pubs or cars. 'Geoff Emerick, engineer on the
Beatles' Sgt. Pepper album, said: "A lot of what is released today is
basically a scrunched-up mess. Whole layers of sound are missing. It is
because record companies don't trust the listener to decide themselves if
they want to turn the volume up." Downloading has exacerbated the effect.
Songs are compressed once again into digital files before being sold on
iTunes and similar sites. The reduction in quality is so marked that EMI
has introduced higher-quality digital tracks, albeit at a premium price,
in response to consumer demand.'"

LinucksGirl writes "The Linux kernel is the core of a large and complex
operating system, and while it's huge, it is well organized in terms of
subsystems and layers. In this article, the reader [0]explores the
general structure of the Linux kernel and gets to know its major
subsystems and core interfaces. 'When discussing architecture of a large
and complex system, you can view the system from many perspectives. One
goal of an architectural decomposition is to provide a way to better
understand the source, and that's what we'll do here. The Linux kernel
implements a number of important architectural attributes. At a high
level, and at lower levels, the kernel is layered into a number of
distinct subsystems. Linux can also be considered monolithic because it
lumps all of the basic services into the kernel. This differs from a
microkernel architecture where the kernel provides basic services such as
communication, I/O, and memory and process management, and more specific
services are plugged in to the microkernel layer.'"

Light Licker writes "Israeli researchers have [0]created artificial
memories for the first time — in a tangle of neurons growing in the lab.
Using a specific chemical they could add to the pattern of impulses in a
network of the nerve cells. 'Many believe that complex patterns of
neuronal firing are templates for memory, which the brain uses when
storing information. Imprinting such "memories" on artificial neural
networks provides a potential way to develop cyborg chips, says
Ben-Jacob. These would be useful for monitoring biological systems like
the brain and blood since, being human, they would respond to the same
chemicals.' The new pattern lasted two days — good enough for biological
RAM?"

[0]prostoalex writes "The Sacramento Bee tells the story of an El Dorado
resident who [1]had to go to small claims court to get his Gateway PC
fixed: 'Right out of the box, he says, the computer displayed scattered
graphics and wouldn't work properly. He says he called a Gateway salesman
five times and sent him an e-mail to get an authorization number to send
the computer back, but his phone calls and message were never returned.
Then, over the course of months, Sheehan said he called Gateway technical
support dozens of times.' Gateway insists that by clicking 'Accept' on a
customer service EULA when the computer was first booted, Mr. Sheehan has
waived his rights to sue the computer manufacturer in United States
courts. The Gateway EULA states that conflicts must be resolved via
private arbitrage. Sheehan, though, argues that he never saw the EULA,
because of the broken graphics. As such, he's not held to that
agreement." Some connections between this and a [2]discussion about a
Second Life case we had yesterday.

has been [0]ordered by a federal judge to monitor its users. They are
asked to keep detailed logs of their activities which must then be handed
over to the MPAA. Ira Rothken, TorrentSpy's attorney responded to the
news by stating: 'It is likely that TorrentSpy would turn off access to
the U.S. before tracking its users. If this order were allowed to stand,
it would mean that Web sites can be required by discovery judges to track
what their users do even if their privacy policy says otherwise.'"

company will patent some obvious thing' and use it to blackmail smaller
companies. Now that [2]Microsoft is a large company with a patent
war-chest of their own, they don't seem so concerned about abuse of the
patent system. I then describe how Verizon's efforts to shut down Vonage
are a perfect illustration of Gates' fears."

admits the levied charge of $500 per 'channel' is supposed to only cover

NewScientist is reporting on [2]what appear to be water puddles in newly

the assumption that these blue 'puddles' are water still has to be tested
by engineers. They'll try to measure the uniform smoothness of the puddle
surfaces. Analysis will also examine their apparent 'opaqueness', where
in some areas observers claim to see pebbles underneath the surface of
the blue areas. From the article: 'No signs of liquid water have been
observed directly from cameras on the surface before. Reports last year
pointed to the existence of gullies on crater walls where water appears
to have flowed in the last few years, as shown in images taken from
orbit, but those are short-lived flows, which are thought to have frozen
over almost immediately.'"

for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said he hadn't heard of Flickr
until told about it in a conversation with a Chronicle reporter, and then
suggested that the blocking may be because Chinese authorities are trying

representative for Reporters Without Borders, a French group that
promotes free expression, said that the Beijing government often censors
Web sites under the guise of protecting children or national security.
She called the blocking of Flickr "one more blow against the free flow of

particularly lamentable in light of promises by China to loosen
restrictions before the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.' Thomas Hawk has a

An anonymous reader writes "The Seattle Post-Intelligencer is reporting
that a local attorney is suing legal startup Avvo over a [0]rating that
was algorithmically assigned. The story covers the controversy of
computers grading humans. 'Browne, who has participated in a number of
high-profile cases in the state, including the defense of arsonist Martin
Pang, said in an interview that Avvo is being irresponsible with the
ratings and called them a fraud. And he questioned why Supreme Court
justices and prominent lawyers score so low. Three other attorneys
interviewed by the P-I also expressed doubts about the rating system,
while News.com reported that the site "seemed to be riddled with bizarre
errors."' Such practices are not new: the New York Times earlier this
year reported on Google [1]using algorithms to determine applicant
suitability. But what happens when you don't like the result? Can a
computer program be considered defamatory?"
