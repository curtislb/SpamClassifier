Roban seis lienzos coloniales de la Bas?lica Menor ?Santa B?rbara? de
Caquingora

APG Noticias
Junio 5, 2007, 0:32 EDT

La Paz, Bolivia -- 
Dos t?cnicos dependientes de la Unidad Nacional de Catalogaci?n del
Viceministerio de Desarrollo de Culturas evidenciaron la substracci?n de
seis lienzos coloniales de la Bas?lica Menor ?Santa B?rbara? de la localidad
de Caquingora, distante a 115 kil?metros de ciudad de la ciudad de La Paz.
El hecho se produjo la madrugada del 1 de junio.

Seg?n las primeras investigaciones, los ladrones entraron en el citado
templo cat?lico rompiendo el candado de la puerta principal durante la
madrugada de este ?ltimo viernes.

Sabino Carpio, sacrist?n de la Bas?lica Menor ?Santa B?rbara?, explic? que
aproximadamente a las seis de la ma?ana del 1 de junio, evidenci? que la
puerta de mencionada iglesia se encontraba entreabierta y con el candado
roto. Cuando ingres? al templo se percat? que faltaban los seis lienzos y
posteriormente alerto a los pobladores sobre el hecho.
 
Un d?a antes del hecho delictivo, los habitantes de Canquingora se
percataron de que una movilidad  desconocida, (posiblemente una vagoneta
guinda), con dos ocupantes merode? por aquella poblaci?n dando vueltas por
la plaza principal. Los ocupantes de la camioneta se?alaron ser funcionarios
de la empresa Trans Redes.

Despu?s del hecho delictuoso los vecinos y autoridades de la poblaci?n de
Caquingora se organizaron y empezaron a buscar pistas. Aparentemente, los
ladrones se quedaron  cerca de la poblaci?n a pernoctar y una vez cometido
el delito se dirigieron a una casa abandonada, la cual se encuentra a dos
kil?metros de Caquingora.
 
De acuerdo con la versi?n de los t?cnicos del Viceministerio de Desarrollo
de Culturas, Lourdes Vallejos, Marianela Tarifa y vecinos de Caquingora, en
dicha casa se encontr? los bastidores de los seis lienzos hurtados, incluso
uno de los bastidores se encontraba roto porque en el intento de desprender
los ?leos con fuerza se da?? la obra y se hall? tambi?n los bordes de los
lienzos. 

Los seis lienzos robados no tienen autor?a y son los siguientes: ?San
Gregorio Magno? t?cnica ?leo sobre lienzo con 159 cent?metros de alto y 106
cent?metros de ancho; ?San Vicente Ferrel?, con165 por 95 cent?metros; ?San
Jos? con el Ni?o Jes?s? de 164 por 90 cent?metros; ?San Jos? con el Ni?o
Jes?s?, 167 por 112 cent?metros; ?San Miguel Arc?ngel? de 165 por 90
cent?metros; y ?Mar?a Inmaculada? de 161 por 200 cent?metros.  
 
A fines del a?o pasado, en un esfuerzo conjunto entre autoridades,
pobladores y residentes  de Caquingora, la Unidad Nacional de Catalogaci?n
del Viceministerio de Desarrollo de Culturas hizo el registro de los bienes
patrimoniales y culturales que posee la Bas?lica Menor ?Santa B?rbara? de
Caquingora.
 
La obras robadas se encuentran registradas y catalogadas en la mencionada
unidad y seg?n normas vigentes son parte del Patrimonio Cultural Boliviano,
por lo cual no pueden ser exportadas ni comercializadas de acuerdo con el
Art?culo 191 de la Constituci?n Pol?tica del Estado y del Decreto Supremo
5918 en sus art?culos 3 y 22 del 6 de noviembre de 1961.
 
En ese entendido, el Viceministerio de Desarrollo de Cultura advierte a los
coleccionistas, restauradores, anticuarios y comerciantes de obras de arte
que tengan cuidado en adquirir esas obras debido a que las autoridades
policiales nacionales e internacionales fueron notificadas y proceder?n de
acuerdo a lo que se?ala la ley. 
 
La poblaci?n de Caquingora distante un centenar de kil?metros de la Sede de
Gobierno, est? situado  en la primera secci?n del municipio de Coro Coro,
provincia Pacajes del departamento de La Paz. Para llegar a este punto se
debe tomar la ruta de la poblaci?n de Viacha.

Bedard's boyfriend says appeal likely after being found guilty of art theft 

Tue, 2007-06-05 20:06 
National News 
By: SIDHARTHA BANERJEE

MONTREAL (CP) - A jury found the boyfriend of Olympic champion Myriam Bedard
guilty of art theft on Tuesday but Nima Mazhari says he will appeal.

Mazhari was convicted Tuesday of stealing 20 paintings from the late Ghitta
Caiserman-Roth between 2001 and 2003. He was also found guilty of possession
of stolen goods worth $100,000. A jury of 10 women and two men deliberated
for two days before returning the verdict.

The normally talkative Mazhari offered brief answers after being surrounded
by reporters while he waited for a city bus outside the Montreal courthouse.

Mazhari called the verdict "ridiculous" and said he fully expected to be
acquitted of all charges.

The crimes came to light when Caiserman-Roth's daughter received a letter
from Bedard's estranged father in 2004 accusing him of the theft.

Mazhari called the allegations ridiculous and said his problems started
after Bedard testified at the inquiry into the sponsorship scandal. He
denied stealing the paintings.

The three-week trial was tinged with elements of a family feud as Bedard
family members and friends of the Olympian testified about their dislike of
Mazhari and his influence over Bedard. Mazhari said the same about the
Bedard family, calling them unreliable and his association with them a big
mistake.

Bedard's father, Pierre, told the jury that he would have never sent the
letter if he'd been able to rekindle a relationship with his daughter, who
had ignored his phone calls for about a year.

Pierre Bedard told French news network LCN in an interview that he is happy
the entire ordeal is over, but doesn't expect the rocky relationship with
his daughter will change.

Crown prosecutor Mario Dufresne said he was pleased with the verdict.
Mazhari's lawyer, Yves Gratton declined to comment.

Mazhari said he was surprised by the verdict but that he felt good, "as
always." He would not say whether he has the financial means to pay a fine.
Mazhari was represented by a legal aid lawyer.

Bedard, who has been by Mazhari's side all through the court proceedings,
was not with him on Tuesday. She has her own legal issues to deal with and
is due in a Quebec City court this month to set a date for her own trial on
child abduction charges.

Bedard and Mazhari dominated news coverage at the end of last year after a
Canada-wide warrant was issued for her arrest on charges of abducting her
11-year-old daughter and taking her to Washington D.C., in violation of a
custody agreement with the girl's father.

Bedard won two gold medals in the biathlon at the 1994 Olympics.

Caiserman-Roth died in 2005.

?70k reward for stolen Lowry paintings 
Tuesday, 05 Jun 2007 18:19 
Police are urging witnesses to come 


An insurance company has offered a ?70,000 reward for information on the
armed gang that broke into a house in Cheadle Hulme and escaped with five
paintings by renowned artist LS Lowry.

AXA has put up the reward for the first person who provides information
leading to the arrest of the offenders and recovery of the paintings, which
include The Viaduct, valued at ?600,000, and Tanker entering the Tyne,
valued at ?700,000.

The paintings were stolen from the home of Ivan Aird, a 41-year-old fine
arts dealer, in the early hours of May 3rd. 

Greater Manchester police Detective Superintendent Tony Cook said: "This
incident came as a great shock to the Cheadle Hulme community.

"The stolen paintings are extremely valuable but also hold a great deal of
sentimental value for Mr Aird, as Mr Lowry was a close family friend. The
paintings are also north-west treasures and are a major part of the heritage
of the region."

Police have urged anyone with any information about the thieves or the
whereabouts of the paintings to contact the GMP major incident room or
Crimestoppers.

"Any information, no matter how insignificant it may seem, could be the key
to tracing these people," DS Cook added.

Man cleared of stealing valuable paintings  
by Matthew Xuereb

 
 A man has been cleared of stealing several paintings worth millions of
liri, including one by Caravaggio, after a magistrate ruled that the police
had not managed to establish a link between the accused and the stolen works
of art. 

Ian Farrugia, from Birkirkara, was charged with stealing the paintings from
the house of Mr Justice Giovanni Bonello in Old Bakery Street, Valletta, in
April 2004. The paintings were discovered by the police behind a false wall
in a garage in Birkirkara and one was found inside a house close to the
garage. 

The stolen paintings formed part of a larger collection of paintings that
were going to be sold abroad. The thief or thieves managed to dig a hole
through a wine cellar and 

the theft remained unnoticed for several weeks. 

Handing down his judgement, magistrate Anthony Vella ruled that the
prosecution had failed to establish a link between the forensic evidence in
its possession and the accused. He said that the only fingerprint that
matched that of the accused was found on a plastic bag used to cover the
paintings, and added that anyone could have placed the bag there. 

Magistrate Vella said the prosecution's evidence left doubts which,
according to the law, had to favour the accused. He said the court could not
send someone to jail on the basis of probability or simply because of a
suspicion. 

As a result, he acquitted Mr Farrugia of all the charges brought against
him. 

Police Inspector Michael Mallia prosecuted while Dr Edward Gatt appeared for
Mr Farrugia.

Ex-museum chief: I'm guilty

'Didn't touch' ticket writer, Susanna Foo insists

The former president of the Independence Seaport Museum pleaded guilty in
federal court yesterday to fraud and tax evasion.
John S. Carter, 57, who headed the maritime museum at Penn's Landing for 17
years until he was canned in March 2006, admitted he had stolen from the
museum to finance a flashy lifestyle.

U.S. District Judge R. Barclay Surrick set sentencing for Sept. 4.

Prosecutors said Carter faces a prison sentence of at least five years, but
a key issue at sentencing will be the actual loss to the museum.

The feds contend that Carter stole $1.5 million and didn't pay income taxes
on it.

Defense attorney Mark Cedrone said Carter "was not prepared to admit to
every fact" the government alleged in arriving at its $1.5 million figure.

Carter could also be fined as much as $600,000. Much of what Carter bought
with museum money has been recovered by the feds and will be auctioned,
prosecutors said, but they want Carter to make full restitution to the
museum.

Carter, who declined to speak with reporters, was released on $100,000
personal-recognizance bond.

He was paid $275,000 to $356,000 per year from 2001 to 2005 and lived
rent-free in a Society Hill townhouse from 1998 to 2006.

But apparently that wasn't enough to support the high-flying lifestyle
Carter craved.

The feds said Carter splurged on stereo equipment, fancy clothes and
overseas trips and a $210,000 carriage house he had built next to his Cape
Cod home.

He then submitted bogus invoices to get the museum to pay for it all.

Carter also used three museum boats for his personal benefit and even had
one of them refurbished at museum expense for more than $400,000. The feds
said he sold it for $190,000 and pocketed the cash.

Carter's name surfaced in the federal probe of state Sen. Vince Fumo, who
was indicted on fraud, conspiracy, obstruction and tax charges in February.
Fumo has pleaded not guilty to the charges.

Fumo, a former museum board member, allegedly bilked the museum out of
$100,000 for free use of museum yachts during summer vacations to Martha's
Vineyard from 1996 to 2003.

The feds alleged in the Fumo indictment that Carter visited in August 1998
and provided goodies for Fumo's party that Carter charged to the museum.

Banksy sculpture is snatched from the garden of 'kidnapper'
Last updated at 15:15pm on 5th June 2007
 

When one of Banksy's art works was "kidnapped" from the streets of London,
it seemed as if the graffiti artist had met his match.

Swept under the carpet ... Red faces as another Banksy mural bites the dust 

Spirited away: The Drinker has disappeared again
The piece was The Drinker - a recreation of Rodin's statue The Thinker, with
a traffic cone on its head - and an "arto-politico terrorist" calling
himself AK47 demanded a ?5,000 ransom. 

Banksy offered ?2 and the deal was refused. Three years on, and thieves have
got into AK47's garden in Hackney and taken the statue, leaving the plinth
and cone. 

AK47 today accused Banksy, or "his people", of being behind the theft. "The
statue was there on Friday when I left for Holland," he said. 

"If Banksy has got it back, I will treat it as a joke. But if it's someone
taking it for its financial value I'd be annoyed." 

The bronze, said by AK47 to be worth about ?300,000, first appeared in 2004.
It was put on a concrete plinth with Banksy planning to move it from venue
to venue. 

Then in April that year it disappeared from Shaftesbury Avenue. When Banksy
refused to pay a ransom the piece languished in a warehouse until AK47
decided that cost too much. 

AK47 claimed the piece was legally his, as it had essentially been dumped on
the streets of London without permission. "I've reported the theft to the
police," he said. 

He claimed that he had been in talks with auctioneers Bonhams over the sale
of the statue, and Banksy had shown interest in buying it back. 

A spokeswoman for Banksy said: "It is nothing to do with him and he does not
want to comment." 

Meanwhile, a mural by Banksy is to be preserved when the Bristol office
block it has adorned for five years is knocked down. 


The Bristol Banksy wall which will be preserved

Mild Mild West, which shows a giant teddy bear hurling a petrol bomb at
police, will be put in a glass atrium for new offices. 

It will be welcome good news for Banksy who had 9 of his limited edition
prints stolen from a Brighton gallery last month. 

In two raids at Artrepublic in Bond Street, Brighton, a total of 10 items
valued at about ?10,000 - nine of them by Banksy - were stolen. 

Sussex Police said it appeared the gallery had been "purposely targeted for
the Banksy works".

Park's sculpture hauled away by thieves


Dan Cordell's work depicted a squirrel, owl and snail.

Large 50kg work is stolen from Harrold-Odell Country Park.

Determined thieves sneaked into a Bedfordshire beautyspot to steal a heavy
wooden statue at the weekend.

They struck at Harrold-Odell Country Park on Friday night or Saturday
morning and broke the distinctive work - which depicts a squirrel, an owl
and a snail - from its concrete base.

They then manhandled the 50kg piece nearly half-a-mile before apparently
loading it into a vehicle and escaping.

Lyndsey Bignell, countryside sites officer for the county council, said the
loss of the chainsaw-carved sculpture had come as a blow.

She said: "It's not worth a tremendous amount of money, but we have been
trying to add different features for people as they are walking. It's a
shame that this statue is not going to be here for people to enjoy any more.

"I think someone has seen it and decided it would look good in their garden.
Someone has just taken a fancy to it."

The statue was created by wood-carver Dan Cordell, who used only a chainsaw
to hew it from cherry wood at an event at the Forest of Marston Vale last
September.

His appearance had been sponsored by the county council, and afterwards it
received the three-feet high piece which had taken him a day to complete.

It was stored in a garage for a while and brought out for special events
before it was given a permanent home at the park on the path around the
northern edge of the lake.

But at some point between 6pm on Friday and 9am on Saturday, thieves smashed
it from its foundations and moved it away from the site. They appear to have
used muscle power for part of the job, as vehicles cannot be brought to
within about half-a-mile of the statue's former position.

Mr Cordell expressed surprise at his work's disappearance.

He said: "It's a strange thing to do - it's not something you could sell on,
and it's not valuable.

"It's only the second piece I have had stolen, so it doesn't happen very
often."

Anyone with any information is asked to contact Sergeant Gary Baldwin at
Riseley Police Station on 01234 275175, or the country park on 01234 720016.
Alternatively, email the country park on hocp@bedscc.gov.uk
