<b>D.C. Madam: The story that wasn't</B>

After weeks of pumping up the idea that the DC Madam's clientele list was full of big beltway names, ABC's 20/20, which had exclusive rights to the list, didn't air any new names on the show this Friday.  So what was this hype all about? and did ABC do the right thing by releasing these names?

<b>The GOP plays "Hardball"  </B>
In their first nationally televised debate, Republican presidential hopefuls squared off with MSNBC's Chris Matthews. Was he fair? Plus, how the media is handling the political showdown over funding U.S. troops in Iraq.

<b>Murdoch's Expanding Empire</B>

Rupert Murdoch makes a play for the Wall Street Journal.  Would the media moguls bid be good for the nation's largest financial newspaper, or is this a case of bigger isn't always better?

<b>Plus,</B>  Imus may not be leaving CBS quietly.  The sharp-tongued media mogul's lawyer says he was wrongly dismissed for his slur against the Rutger's women's basketball team, and a fight over $40 million dollars is brewing.  All that and more, on this week's Reliable Sources!

<b>Join us this Sunday and every Sunday at 10am ET / 7am PT for our critical look at the media! </B>
