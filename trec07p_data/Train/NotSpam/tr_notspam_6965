) TouTouke (a.k.a Agnes Scholiers) is a freelance dietitian whose main hobby is
photography, which she studies with her husband and father. She has been an SXC
contributor since March, 2004, and her images rank among the top 10 in average rating and
top 100 in downloads. We caught up with Agnes via e-mail to talk about her wonderful
images.

 First of all, I especially wish to thank my father for all the technical knowledge he
teaches me to improve my skills, since my beginning in digital photography last year.

  The concept of SXC is for us also very challenging, and we appreciate adapting our
technique to produce stock pictures that most people will enjoy.

You have some dazzling landscape images. The exposure and color are spot on. Are these
single frame images or composites or a little of both?

First of all, we wish to thank the webmaster for this interview. Mostpictures are single
framed images using natural light and colors. Sometimessome post-processing is performed,
but no composite organization of severalpictures is used. (Except obviously in for " (
http://nl.internet.com/ct.html?rtr=on&s=1,35h6,1,1c87,2w05,7nzx,i27f
) The Oak" uploaded recently) 

We try to conceive a picture as a whole with the goal that it be "perfect"as originally
photographed. It is similar to the technique employed when weused film or analog cameras.
Each capture was a moment of responsibility andwould not have been modified by
post-processing. In fact, we try to dodigital photography as if it were film or analog
photography, with the samekind of approach and care, but with all the benefits of
digital.

You have an incredible sense of lighting, which is probably the most important aspect to
photography. Have you always had an eye for lighting? Inwhat ways can others hone or
improve their sense of lighting? Can it belearned?

We appreciate some care and time in our captures, so we often walk aroundthe objects or
think about the scene for some days. Light is obviously themain parameter of photography
and the interferences of light in digitalphotography are different than in traditional
film photography. We thinkabout various shooting situations of the same item or scene to
get the bestresult and learn to manage the lighting where possible.

Yes, it can be learned in the sense that taking time is the best way to makea good
picture.

Do you mainly use ambient/available light or do you have studio lighting?

 Yes, we mainly use natural ambient light. Even in the evening, we preferlong exposures
to the use of flashes to capture the subtleties of nocturnalor evening colors. We do not
own a studio, but even with our reflex cameras,we prefer natural lighting. 

As we mostly use compact cameras, the quality of flash is very low. For thisreason also,
we try to shoot with natural lighting. The use of compactcameras is motivated by the fact
of their availability and size, so that wecan have them with us at all times to catch
opportunities as they occur.

Do you start out with a vision and try to achieve it through photography, ordo you tend
to experiment and explore more with your camera?

Our vision initially is only to try to produce quality, well-framed, nicelyexposed
photographs with a wide range of themes. So we don't really share avision, but we do
explore and "play" with the camera as you probably haveobserved. We have a very wide
range of interests which results in diversityin our photographs.

Sometimes we like to produce pictures that are photojournalistic in nature.We did that in
Belgium about the crashed industry as testimonials of thatperiod.

What ways do you use Photoshop to improve your images?

We use Photoshop to adjust and correct tonal balance and saturation. Inaddition,
Photoshop is useful for cutting the subjects out of their initialcontext. The initial
reality of the subject, however, is the base of ourpictures. We try to preserve that
reality and do not use "artistical"concepts and deformations of the initial capture.
