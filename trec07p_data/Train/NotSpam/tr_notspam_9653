Chas, Tom, Martin -- thank you for all of your expertise and valuable
insight to helping me understand the logic in the previous regex.  As
for where I saw this code, a friend of mine works for a company that has
a unique approach of attracting coders. And I thought it might be a
unique way of potentially attracting decent developers to my firm in the
future. Anyway got the idea from here: http://www.fonality.com/careers.html

I didn't even bother with the second regexp, that's a bit obfuscated for
my trivia needs. Deciphering the following:

s;(?:SEEKING)?;PERLqny~%|fsyx%~tz&;?$^X=~m.\w+$.
:DEVELOPERS;s"$&"Ktsf"i;s^.^chr ord($&)-5^eg;$\=$/;print||" ;) "
