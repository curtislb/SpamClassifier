HEADLINES:
REJECTION & REASONING: PRES. BUSH WILL TALK AFTER GETTING WAR BILL
Today, President Bush will make a statement – a few hours after he receives a $124 billion war-spending bill that calls for the withdrawal of American combat troops from Iraq, the White House said.  The president has said he will veto the measure.  Dan Bartlett, a counselor to the president, said Mister Bush has asked the three broadcast networks for air time.

It’s four years after President Bush landed on an aircraft carrier in the Pacific Ocean and declared major combat in Iraq was done – under a banner that said, “Mission Accomplished.”  Today, President Bush said a U.S. failure in the 4-year-old war "should be unacceptable to the civilized world."  The White House marked the anniversary by accusing congressional Democrats of using the date to present the president with the bill.  Speaking to U.S. and allied military officers at U.S. Central Command headquarters outside Tampa, Mister Bush said the current push to pacify Baghdad and the western province of Anbar has produced progress, but will need several months to succeed.  "Coalition forces have captured a number of key terrorist leaders who are providing information about how al Qaeda operates in Iraq," he said. "They stopped a car bomb network, that had killed many citizens of Baghdad, and destroyed major car bomb factories. There has been a decline in sectarian violence an!
 d in some areas of the capital Iraqis are returning to their neighborhoods with an increased feeling of security."

SHADOWY IRAQ OFFICE ACCUSED OF SECTARIAN AGENDA
Iraq's prime minister has created an entity within his government that U.S. and Iraqi military officials say is being used as a smokescreen to hide an extreme Shiite agenda that is worsening the country's sectarian divide.  The "Office of the Commander in Chief" has the power to overrule other government ministries, according to U.S. military and intelligence sources.  Those sources say the 24-member office is abusing its power, increasingly overriding decisions made by the Iraqi Ministries of Defense and Interior and potentially undermining the entire U.S. effort in Iraq.  The Office, as it is known in Baghdad, was set up about four months ago with the knowledge of American forces in Iraq. Its goal is ostensibly to advise Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki -- the nation's new commander in chief -- on military matters.   According to a U.S. intelligence source, the Office is "ensuring the emplacement of commanders it favors and can control, regardless of what the ministries want.!
 "  Ali Dabbagh, spokesman for the Iraqi government, would not respond directly to questions about what authority the Office exercises within the Iraqi government.  He denied allegations that the prime minister's advisers were trying to push a Shiite agenda.

However, a senior Iraqi army officer disagreed.  The officer, who is seeking help from the senior U.S. command said: "The Office is not supposed to be taking charge like this.  It's overstepping its role as an advisory office. It's not a healthy thing to have.  It's people with no power who want to have power."  A senior U.S. military official cited several cases in Baghdad in which Iraqi commanders considered capable by the U.S. were detained or forced out of their positions after cracking down on Shiite militias.  A White House official confirmed that the U.S. government does have specific concerns about the Office, adding: "We are working with them on their command and control issues to make sure it works properly and so that commanders are put into their jobs for the right reasons and not just sectarian reasons."  Yesterday, White House press secretary Tony Snow said the administration was "concerned" about stories that the Iraqi government was trying to execute the Bagh!
 dad security plan along sectarian lines.

RAGE IN THE STREETS: DEMONSTRATORS CALL FOR CHANGE IN IMMIGRATION LAWS
>From Los Angeles to New York, demonstrators descended on city centers around the country to call for Congress to pass legislation that would give the estimated 12 million people in the United States illegally a path to citizenship.  In Chicago, where a police spokeswoman estimated the crowd at 20,000 early in the afternoon, organizers predicted a total of hundreds of thousands of demonstrators would participate in a two-mile march to Union Park, where estimates of last year's attendance ranged from 400,000 to 700,000.  Organizers of this year's events are focusing on raids by immigration officials that have separated some of the nation's illegal immigrants from their children, who are U.S. citizens if born in the United States.  Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff tells CNN, "We do have to remember, it's the parents' choice to break the law."  "At the end of the day, we cannot compromise on enforcing the law simply because somebody has given birth to a!
  child in the United States."  Children who are born in the United States are not deported, he said, "Although we recognize that, in almost all cases, the child will accompany the parent back."  But he added that he too believes that Congress, which is slated to consider the matter beginning May 14, must pass legislation. "We are going to need to find a way that is reasonable and fair and not an amnesty to deal with the undocumented workers who are here," he said.

HOUSE PANEL APPROVES SUBPOENA FOR FORMER DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL
By a voice vote, today a House Judiciary Subcommittee approved the issuing of a subpoena to former Deputy Attorney General James Comey to testify as part of its investigation into the firing of the eight U.S. attorneys.  The panel chairwoman, Congresswoman Linda Sanchez, Democrat of California, said Comey has informed the committee he will comply, and appear at a hearing of the Commercial and Administrative Law Subcommittee set for Thursday.  "We believe that he can shed light on the Bush Administration's list of targeted U.S. attorneys," Sanchez said.  Comey announced his resignation in April 2005 but served for several months afterwards until a replacement was named.  Through documents released and testimony given to Congress, Justice Department officials have said the process for choosing which prosecutors would be asked to leave began in January 2005.  Paul McNulty, who replaced Comey, was one of the officials involved in later discussions about the firings.  He told sta!
 ff from the Senate and House Judiciary Committees during an all-day closed-door interview Friday he only had limited involvement in the process, a congressional aide familiar with the interview confirmed to CNN.  McNulty became the latest official to say he was not responsible for putting the names on the list of those to be fired, the congressional aide said.  Previously Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and former Justice Department Chief of Staff Kyle Sampson have testified they did not add names of specific prosecutors. One major question those leading the Capitol Hill investigations into the firings have said they are trying to answer is exactly how that list was drawn up.

FIDEL CASTRO A NO-SHOW AT MAY DAY EVENT
For the first time in more than 40 years, President Fidel Castro failed to make an appearance at the annual May 1 celebration of the International Day of the Worker held here in the capital.  Castro, 80, underwent intestinal surgery nine months ago and has not been seen in public since. He ceded power temporarily to his brother Raul, 75, who did show up for the event, looking through binoculars at the throngs of marchers in the Plaza de la Revolucion Jose Marti.  Some observers had speculated that the communist leader may have recovered sufficiently to attend the event.  Despite his failure to show, the elder leader was not forgotten. "Viva Fidel! Viva Raul! Viva Cuba Libre! Socialism or Death!" exhorted Salvador Valdes Mesa, secretary general of the Cuban Workers Center, to applause.
