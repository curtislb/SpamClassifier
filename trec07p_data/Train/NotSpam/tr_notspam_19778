8:30 AM, 6/16/07, Update: Computer recovery continues; Williams sets space =
endurance record=20

Russian flight controllers successfully switched a command-and-control comp=
uter over to operational status early today and began the process of re-act=
ivating critical systems aboard the international space station after elect=
ronic bypass surgery Friday to isolate suspect power supply switches.

"In the last 24 hours, we've had a lot of successes," Flight Director Holly=
 Ridings said early today.

Early today, outgoing space station astronaut Sunita Williams, launched to =
the lab complex aboard shuttle Discovery last December, passed the 188-day =
four-hour mark, setting a new space endurance record for female astronauts.=
 The old record was set by Shannon Lucid during a stay aboard the old Russi=
an Mir space station.

Atlantis delivered Williams' replacement - Clay Anderson - to the internati=
onal space station and if all goes well, Williams will return to Earth next=
 week aboard the shuttle.

"We think Suni's awesome, I mean she's been just so much fun to have on orb=
it," Ridings said. "She's competent, intelligent, laid back and we've just =
really, really enjoyed her stay on orbit."

Today, Williams should have time to catch up a bit briefing Anderson on the=
 subtleties of space station operation.

"One of the by products of doing all this wonderful troubleshooting in the =
last couple of days is we haven't done some of our standard work," Ridings =
said, "which is to transfer items back and forth between the shuttle and st=
ation and to have some time for Suni and Clay to talk to each other and do =
some what we call handover, where Suni will teach him sort of the rules of =
the road, where things are and how things are done. So hopefully today, the=
 crews will get to take a deep breath now that the systems are a little mor=
e (healthy)."

The astronauts face a relatively light schedule, preparing tools for a four=
th and final spacewalk Sunday and holding a traditional joint crew news con=
ference this evening at 7:43 p.m. Here is an updated timeline of today's ac=
tivities (in EDT and mission elapsed time; includes rev. L of the NASA tele=

Earlier this week, around the time the Atlantis astronauts were installing =
a new solar power truss, the guidance computer system in the Russian segmen=
t of the station, a three-computer set known collectively as the terminal c=
omputer, suffered a malfunction and crashed. An automated reboot procedure =
was then executed to shut down and restart all three terminal computer "lan=
es" and the three machines making up the command-and-control system central=
 computer. The reboot procedure didn't work.

After two days of fruitless, around-the-clock troubleshooting, engineers di=
sconnected the computers from U.S. solar power early Friday on the theory s=
omething in the circuitry was producing "noise" or otherwise interfering wi=
th the operation of the German-built computers. The computers are equipped =
with power supplies that include protective low-voltage circuitry sensitive=
 to such noise.

When commands were sent to activate the isolated computers, they failed to =
respond properly and engineers feared the worst - a subtle software bug or =
a hardware failure that at some point, in a worst-case scenario, could forc=
e the station crew to abandon ship.

The Russians ultimately determined that two computers - one terminal lane a=
nd one central lane - had suffered hardware failures in their secondary pow=
er supplies earlier in the week. So they asked station commander Fyodor Yur=
chikhin and flight engineer Oleg Kotov to bypass the suspect power supply c=
ircuitry in the other four computers.

To the relief of the U.S. and Russian flight control teams, the procedure w=
orked and the computers booted normally.

"There were a lot of really smart people here and over in Moscow working li=
terally around the clock to try to figure out what we needed to do," Riding=
s said early today. "And I'm happy to report we have established some commu=
nication with the computers on the Russian segment."

The computer initially were allowed to run in self-test mode to verify thei=
r general health. Overnight, during passes over Russian ground stations, Ru=
ssian engineers "started doing some further troubleshooting," Ridings said.=
 "The first thing they were able to do was bring up one of those two lanes =
of the central computer to an operational state where they could send comma=
nds to it, receive some telemetry. We managed to get the central computer .=
.. on the U.S. side to communicate so now we've got the top-tier computer i=
n both the Russian segment and the U.S. segment talking to each other. ... =
So that was great progress.

"The next step is the terminal computer, which is the guidance and navigati=
on computer on the Russian segment, or SMTC," Ridings said. "They turned th=
at computer on, it took a little more work, but just as before, they manage=
d to synch up with the U.S. GNC computer and that SMTC and have them talk t=
o each other as well. They were working on getting all the software modes s=
et right and get everything looking stable and steady so that kind of bit b=
y bit we can check and make sure our attitude control system is working pro=
perly.

"So of the four computers I've mentioned - Russian central computer, U.S. c=
entral computer, U.S. navigation computer and Russian navigation computer -=
 all four of them are talking to each other, which is a huge improvement fr=
om yesterday."

After assessing the operation of the machines, the Russians switched one ce=
ntral computer lane and one terminal lane to operational mode.

"Now that we've got command capability and telemetry, our Russian colleague=
s are going to start bringing al the systems back on line, kind of take bab=
y steps and do it bit by bit," Ridings said. "Same thing with our attitude =
control system."

Early today, Russian flight controllers asked Yurchikhin and Kotov to hotwi=
re the two computers with failed power supply switches to get all of the ma=
chines in the same state.
