This message is to let you know that your fastmail.fm account
"asvcasfd@fastmail.fm" is scheduled to be closed in 7 days, because you
have not used it for some time. Non-paying accounts are closed after 45
days of inactivity, whilst one-time fee accounts are closed after 120
days of inactivity. If you wish for us to close your account, just do
nothing and we will delete it in 14 days.

If you wish to maintain your account, just login. To login, click here:

Your user name is "asvcasfd@fastmail.fm". If you have lost your

To avoid having your account closed due to inactivity in the future, you

"Upgrade Account". If you upgrade to a one-time payment level, you only
have to login every 120 days to maintain your account. On subscription

addition, by upgrading you will get more storage, transfer quota, and
many additional features.
