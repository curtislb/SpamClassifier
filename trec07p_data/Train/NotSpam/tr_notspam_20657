Hello,

speech dispatcher in C implementation is still one of key Brailcom
project. tts-api-provider and a new implementation of speech dispatcher
will bring new possibilities but again we will support both variant how
long will be necessary. Now you can try a new cvs snapshot of C speech
dispatcher where are some bug fixes.

Best
