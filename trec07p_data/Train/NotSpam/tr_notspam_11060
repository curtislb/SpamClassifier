Yes, lmer can handle unbalanced data and large data sets.

Yes, that should do it.

I enclose a short function to automate the process by extracting the
information from the value of VarCorr.

Thank you. It's wonderful to hear that it is helpful.  The main
objective in developing lmer was to be able to handle large data sets
with crossed or partially crossed random effects.
