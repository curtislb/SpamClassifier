Something is wrong with your setup. According to the package's websites [1], 
recordmydesktop does not exist for Etch (stable). It is available in testing 
and unstable only where it depends on lib6 >= 2.3.6-6, itself available in 
testing, and >= 2.5 in unstable. It looks like you may have made a naughty 
mess of your sources.list.
