     This may need a little editing:

#!/bin/bash
for ( file in filelist.txt ) do {
     lynx -d ftp.wherever.com/directory/%file >  ~/savedir/%file
     grep -i "%file" filelist.txt > filelist.tmp
     mv -f filelist.tmp filelist.txt
} done

     Crap it's been a long time.  Anyway, if you have a list of files
you'd like to download saved to filelist.txt, you can run it in a for
loop.  Use the lynx dump feature to dump  what you want to a file.  Just
point lynx at it and redirect the output to %file, which will be the
file listed in filelist.txt.  Then do an inverse grep on filelist.txt to
remove the filename and redirect grep's output to a temp file.  Then
move the temp file back to filelist.txt, overwriting it, and you should
be done.  [Ctrl+C] will interrupt this script at any time, and resume
where you left off .  I'm *pretty* sure it will work.  I'm just not sure
I got the for command written properly.  Yeah, it could really be 
prettied up using %1 from the command line to name filelist.txt instead. 
  Also pointing lynx's output to a download dir would help too, but the 
principal idea is there.  Have you considered the 'wget' command?  I 
don't know why you're downloading files that way.  Are you on a dialup 
connection?  The only thing about the script above is it expects a 
specific site and directory.  Considerably more work would be needed to 
make it a more generic script that could be used for any site, dir, and 
file list.  Anyway, I HTH,

         Michael
