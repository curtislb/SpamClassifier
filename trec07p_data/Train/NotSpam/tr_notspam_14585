parrot-porters and perl6-internals are supposed to be synonymous - I have a 
ticket into the postmaster to see if we can resolve this issue, sorry about 
the confusion.

Not really.

I would recommend you check out some of the languages in the languages/ 
directory: abc in particular was designed to be an intro to using parrot's 
compiler tools, and is probably the easiest to grasp at the moment.

Pattern matching is provided with one of the PGE compilers. See 
languages/tcl/runtime/builtin/regexp.pir for an example (there is probably 
better documentation, I just happened to know I was using it there in tcl.)

Sure. languages/BASIC used perl, as did tcl some time back. Most are 
generating PIR with PIR these days, though. (ISTR plumhead is generating PIR 
multiple ways)

Don't think so. Is there one you'd like to see?

Parrot itself is probably easier than perl at the moment.

Hope this helps.
