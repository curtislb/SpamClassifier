Well, on a machine at home I am having the problem that linux insists that 
I don't have a cable connected when it most certainly is connected.  I 
have tried it through a router and the cable modem, both with no success.
I suppose I'll have to try my WINDOWS xp machine I have dedicated to 
Kurzweil Reader.

     Take Care,
      Jim
