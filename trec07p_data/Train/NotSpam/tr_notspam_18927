I don't think that short and understandable necessarily go hand-in-hand.
Sometimes longer scripts which are more explicit and use less tricky
syntax shortcuts are much easier to understand a year or two later. Ease
and speed of script writing (taking into account learning curve and time
taken to consult scripting language documentation) are important, as is
the ability to re-visit scripts or examine someone else's script and be
able to work out what it does and how it works is vital, and speed of
execution also counts with large datasets. Also ubiquity of the tool,
whether it is freely available on many platforms, either pre-installed
or in an easy-to-install form are also considerations.

The ability of the tools to scale to large or very large datasets is
also a consideration, as is their speed when dealing with such large data.

Yes, happy to contribute R + Python examples to such wiki pages. Please
post the URL.
