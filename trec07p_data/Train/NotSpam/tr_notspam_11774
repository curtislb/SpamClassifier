Errors-To: speakup-bounces@braille.uwo.ca

The arecord error is meaningless since the alsa driver for the
card failed to load. It may be the case that udev is loading 
driver modules in an order that is causing problems. It may 
be useful to try booting without udev. Also in a situation like
this some manual loading of modules one by one might shed
some light on the situation.

lsmod will show loaded modules
insmod will install a module
rmmod will remove a module
modprobe is another way to load a module

You could try using rmmod to remove all audio related 
drivers then start loading them one by one watching for
any error messages on load, something like

modprobe snd
modprobe soundcore
modprobe snd-ens1371
modprobe snd-emu10k1
modprobe snd-mixer-oss
modeprobe snd-seq-oss
modprobe snd-pcm-oss

Note there may be options on the modules for the card drivers 
(ensoniq and sblive) that can tweak their configuration on load, 
see the alsa pages for details. Also this may be useful

http://alsa.opensrc.org/MultipleCards

google alsa multiple sound cards
will reveal tons of more info including others' dual sound card 
problems and solutions
