With the work over the past week, the issues seem to be back to a few
'usual suspsects'.
In particular, we have 64-bit issues with the pidl tests, and an issue
with the propagation of lcov CFLAGS on 'tridge' (again, for the pidl
tests).=20

I think we can do a TP5 release in this state, and I'll try to work on
this (and finishing my LDAP backend documentation) over the next week.=20

I would like to hear from anybody that still has issues with Vista
joining Samba4, but after my work on qfileinfo it works for me.
