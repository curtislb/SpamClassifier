My intent is to keep it within Perl, but I seem to be going further  
outside of it due to this problem. I'm involved in all sorts of Perl- 
unrelated nonsense.

I've taken another look at HTML::Tidy, and it appears that there are  
some critical issues with the version of tidylib that's on Mac OS X,  
including the version number. Tidy's included, which is nice, but  
fink is intent on keeping the same (old) version.

I figure, get the latest from CVS, but there's been some problems  
there (probably due to me having never used it before). Rebuilding a  
new version of the lib hasn't been successful yet due to a variety of  
problems (but I may solve them tonite). Thus writing an Xsub to it  
(another thing for me to learn) seems excessive. Now I'm really far out!

Roadblocks everywhere!

I'm thinking that a little RegEx might just serve me better even  
though it's reinventing the wheel. This script is intended for use  
with a file from a specific vendor, which has it's own quirks (it  
looks like someone set it an exporter 10 years ago and then left the  
company) that make no sense. It's not _so_ bad to make some custom  
code, is it? Yuck.
