Mark Hammond's win32com Python OLE/ActiveX integration stuff is top 
notch quality, excellent hard core code -- an industrial strength tour 
de force! Its deep scope and the wide range of complex Windows COM 
interfaces that it covers is truly amazing. You can actually use it to 
implement ActiveX controls (OLE/COM servers) in Python, embed JScript 
interpreters via IScriptingEngine, and other tricky stuff like that. 
I've used it to integrate Python with Internet Explorer on Windows, so 
Python can reach in and mess around with the DOM tree via OLE 
Automation. Much easier and more powerful than trying to do everything 
by remote control via http/xml/ajax/etc. It works quite well, and is 
extremely magical, but of course it's a sausage factory inside. (That 
comes with the territory.)

The fact that Mark Hammond is the person behind pyxpcom is why I can 
trust that pyxpcom is good solid technology, because he knows what he's 
doing and has been down that road before. (There aren't a lot of other 
people in the world with his experience and track record.) I think it 
would be a great idea and an excellent investment to use and develop 
pyxpcom for the OLPC project.

Just to be able to go browser.document.body.innerHTML = '<p>Hello 
World!</p>' would be a great start! Even better would be a way for 
Python to handle unsolicited events from JavaScript.
