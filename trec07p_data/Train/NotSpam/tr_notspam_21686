12:15 PM, 6/22/07, Update: Clouds, rain showers force one-orbit landing del=
ay=20

Already running a day late due to blustery Florida weather, entry flight di=
rector Norm Knight told the Atlantis astronauts today to pass up their firs=
t opportunity to land in Florida and to stay in space an extra orbit. Unles=
s the weather in Florida dramatically improves, commander Rick Sturckow lik=
ely will head for at landing at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.

"C.J., the showers are not pushing out of the circle at KSC like we were ho=
ping, so we're going to wave off this rev," astronaut Dominic "Tony" Antone=
lli radioed Sturckow from Houston. "We're going to take a hard look at KSC =
for this next (orbit), rev 219, and we'll also be looking at Edwards."

If Knight decides to divert Atlantis to Edwards, Sturkow and pilot Lee Arch=
ambault will fire the shuttle's braking rockets around 2:43:39 p.m. EDT to =
set up a landing on runway 22 around 3:50 p.m. EDT.

If the weather improves enough to take a shot at Florida, the shuttle's bra=
king rockets will be fired at 2:50:31 p.m. for a landing on runway 15 aroun=
d 3:55 p.m.

There are no other Florida landing opportunities today. There are three opp=
ortunities to land at Edwards, but the winds are expected to build up as th=
e day wears on. Given a poor forecast for Saturday at all three of NASA's s=
huttle landing sites, Knight is expected to bring Atlantis home on the next=
 opportunity, either at Kennedy or Edwards.
