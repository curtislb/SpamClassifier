You might get more help on the debian-laptop mailing list.
Please do not cross-post though

It would help if you told us which version of Debian, if any, you are
running.

I would suggest that if you are running Debian, you install the
debian-reference package.  Reading through that might give you some
insight as to what you need to do to attempt to fix your problems.
