Lou Dobbs Tonight
Friday, April 27, 2007

Tonight, a blistering attack from a high-ranking active duty
Army officer blames the generals for failing to prepare their
forces and misleading Congress about the situation in Iraq.
We’ve seen these attacks from retired officers before, but it’s
rare to hear these dire warnings from sitting officers. We’ll
have the latest on this story tonight.

A coalition of consumer groups claim the Consumer Product
Safety Commission is stacking its cards in favor of industry
and not American consumers. The Bush administration has
nominated industry lobbyist Michael Baroody as Chairman of the
CPSC. If Baroody is elected, he will be the second of three
commissioners on the CPSP’s board who are industry lobbyists.
Whose side is our government fighting for?

The Center for Public Integrity has found that the Bush
administration has gone easy on polluters in America. More than
27 years after the government launched the Superfund program to
clean up toxic waste sites, the Center for Public Integrity has
found that the program has lost both funding and momentum to
clean up more than 1,000 sites in the United States. We’ll
bring you that shocking story tonight.

Attorney General Alberto Gonzales meets with his Mexican
counterpoint today, Eduardo Medina Mora in Washington. We’ll
have a full report on Mexican–U.S. cooperation cracking down on
criminal activity, and we’ll also examine Mexican influence on
the U.S. criminal justice system.

And Lou will be joined by three of the country's best political
analysts –former White House Political Director Ed Rollins,
Democratic National Committeeman Robert Zimmerman and Pulitzer
Prize-winning columnist Michael Goodwin of the New York Daily
News – for a take on the week’s top headlines.

Visit http://cnn.com/loudobbstonight to read Lou’s
latest commentary on how the mainstream media is intentionally
hiding the truth about illegal immigration, and for more on
tonight’s show.

Lou Dobbs lays out his manifesto to save the middle class in
his new book, “War on the Middle Class: How the Government, Big
Business, and Special Interest Groups Are Waging War on the
American Dream and How to Fight Back.” War on the Middle Class
is now on sale in bookstores near you and on Amazon.com and
BarnesandNoble.com.
