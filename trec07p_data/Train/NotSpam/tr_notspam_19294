Localization is something we need to figure out how to do.  My
instinct is to do the following:

* Allow someone to explicitly request a specific locale, ie,
  <script src="http://cc.org/widget/de/source.js"></script>
* If they request the "generic" version, use the browser's language
information to return the "best guess".  So if the default language in
the browser is pt-BR, we'd return the Brazilian Portuguese version
even if the generic one was requested.

Does that sound reasonable?

I don't think it'd be appropriate for XUL applications -- for one
thing it'll be using document.write to inject an HTML <input> element
(well, several of them), which doesn't always work well in XUL in my
experience (iirc you have to do some special namespace declarations to
mix XUL and HTML).
