You code would be much more readable (but a little slower) with
strftime() rather than rolling your own manipulations of the return
value of localtime().

  use POSIX 'strftime';
  my @date = localtime($time);
  push @days, strftime '%d', @date;
  push @months, strftime'%m',@date;
  push @years, strftime '%Y',@date;
  push @searchDate, strftime '%Y-%m-%d',@date

Be aware strftime() is in the POSIX module so there's a theoretical
risk that it may not be available on all platforms. However AFAIK
there are no platforms on which Perl currently runs where
POSIX::strftime is not implemented.

That's not a problem. localtime() knows all about leap years.

Prozac?

But don't simply pop a pill because what you _should_ worry about is
daylight saving time which could cause a date to be skipped or
repeated.

You should make sure that $time is not within the first or last hour
of the day. I would make sure $time starts out at a 12:00.
