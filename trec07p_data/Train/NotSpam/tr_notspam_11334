TONIGHT ON SHOWBIZ TONIGHT- CNN HEADLINE PRIME 11pm ET/ 11pm PT

<b>PARIS HILTON'S JAIL TIME SHORTENED!</b>
Paris Hilton's 45-day jail sentence has been shortened by about half, even before she serves any time! Is Paris getting special treatment? The outrage, tonight on TV's most provocative entertainment news show.

<b>"AMERICAN IDOL" SHOWDOWN</b>
It's down to two on "American Idol," but sometimes the losers are the winners! We take a look at how there are no guarantees about who ends up selling records when it comes to "Idol." Plus, Kelly Clarkson is here in the interview you’ll see only on Showbiz Tonight.

<b>SEX & VIOLENCE IN PRIME TIME</b>
It used to be that 8pm was family viewing hour on television -- but now, the prime time shows are filled with sex, drugs, and violence. Is it time for a change?

<b>SHOWBIZ TONIGHT QUESTION OF THE DAY:</b>
Paris Hilton's jail time shortened: Is she getting special treatment?
