Fyi: It seems that Ken Adelman, Donald Rumsfeld's former right-hand
man, is now keeping the wolf from the door by lending his name to
usaforinnovation.org.  The note distributed below to a Democratic
listserv aims to undermine support for Thailand's historic compulsory
licences by wrapping pharma's monopolistic practices in the call to
save "American" jobs! As this list knows, drug companies are
transnational, many not even headquartered in the US; and outsourcing
is already their middle name. - Ellen Shaffer

>A military dictatorship took control of Thailand by coup last
>September and has since been leading the latest attack on American jobs.
>
>The military has stolen money from Americans through the imposition
>of capital controls, has passed new discriminatory business laws
>against Americans working in Thailand, and is now stealing American
>medical innovations - a direct attack on hundreds of thousands of
>American scientists, doctors, teachers and researchers.

>The new Ministry of Health has been particularly fixated on harming
>Americans. The military-appointed representative at the World Health
>Organization, Dr. Suwit Wibulpolprasert, proposed in January holding
>Western tourists hostage to bargain for flu vaccines.

>But the junta's ire is not solely directed at America - they are
>proving themselves to be dangerous to Thailand as well.

>The new military regime overtly displayed its corruption by awarding
>themselves pay increases of nearly $10 million and going on a
>military spending spree surpassing the $1 billion mark.
>
>And just last month, Human Rights Watch issued a report critical of
>the Thai government, accusing them in the mass "disappearances" of
>Malay Muslims including the use of "paramilitary Army rangers and
>village defense volunteers", putting innocent civilians at risk.

>This week, the Thai Minister of Health is holding court with

>While there are many issues around the world surrounding delivery of
