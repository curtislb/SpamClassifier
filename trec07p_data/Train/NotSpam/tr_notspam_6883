CLINTON, OBAMA TO JOIN JUNE NH DEBATE: Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama Tuesday joined the leading Democratic and
Republican White House hopefuls in agreeing to participate in back-to-back New Hampshire presidential debates next
month in the politically influential Granite State. Clinton and Obama were the final two presidential contenders to
announce plans to participate in the debates, which are being held by CNN, WMUR and the New Hampshire Union Leader.
Democrats will take the stage at Saint Anselm College on June 3, and Republicans visit the campus on June 5. Despite
early statements that they would work within a debate sanctioning process instituted by the Democratic National
Committee, Clinton, a New York Democrat, and Obama, an Illinois Democrat, announced within hours of each other their
intentions to take part in the June debate. CNN.com: Clinton, Obama give thumbs up to New Hampshire debate

BUSH VETOES BILL, CALLS DEADLINE FOR WITHDRAWAL "IRRESPONSIBLE": President Bush vetoed a Democratic war spending bill
Tuesday that would have compelled him to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq, a move that came exactly four years after he
triumphantly landed on an aircraft carrier to announce the end of "major combat operations." "Setting a deadline for
withdrawal is setting a date for failure, and that would be irresponsible," Bush said. On a day rich with symbolism,
the president fulfilled his veto threat in the White House's main hall, hours after the House and Senate majority
leaders sent Bush the legislation after a rare signing ceremony of their own. Democrats condemned Bush's action and
accused him of misrepresenting their legislation. "If the president thinks by vetoing this bill he'll stop us from
working to change the direction of the war in Iraq, he is mistaken," said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.).

STATE WORRIED ABOUT PTSD IN IRAQ'S FOREIGN SERVICE WORKERS: U.S. diplomats are returning from Iraq with the same
debilitating, stress-related symptoms that have afflicted many U.S. troops, prompting the State Department to order a
mental health survey of 1,400 employees who have completed assignments there. Larry Brown, the State Department's
director of medical services, said that as early as this month the department will e-mail questionnaires to employees
who have been posted in Iraq. The surveys, to be completed anonymously, are intended to determine how many returning
diplomats and civilian employees are suffering post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other problems as a result of
exposure to a war zone, Brown said. State Department employees in Iraq seldom leave the capital's heavily fortified
Green Zone. Even there, rocket and mortar attacks are frequent, and the sound of gunfire is constant. USA Today: U.S.
diplomats returning from Iraq with post-traumatic stress disorder

DEPUTY AG "WAS SURPRISED TO LEARN" OF U.S. ATTORNEY FIRINGS: Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty told congressional
investigators he was surprised to learn in late October of a plan to fire U.S. attorneys and didn't know why they were
targeted for removal, Senate aides said. McNulty, questioned in private on April 27 by House and Senate lawyers, said
he never asked Attorney General Alberto Gonzales or his former chief of staff, D. Kyle Sampson, the reasons for the
eight dismissals, said one aide. The two aides spoke on condition of anonymity. Gonzales testified before the Senate
Judiciary Committee last month that seven U.S. attorneys who were asked to resign on Dec. 7 were drawn from a
"consensus" of senior Justice Department officials. Neither Gonzales nor Sampson, who also testified before the
committee, could say why individual prosecutors were singled out. Bloomberg: McNulty Asserts He Knew Little of Firings,
Aides Say http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=washingtonstory&sid=aA9JUhfQbP5s

"ANOTHER EXAMPLE" OF AG STATEMENTS CONFLICTING WITH ACTIONS OF AIDES: On Nov. 10, 2005, Attorney General Alberto R.
Gonzales sent a letter to a federal judge in Montana, assuring him that the U.S. attorney there, William W. Mercer, was
not violating federal law by spending most of his time in Washington as a senior Justice Department official. That same
day, Mercer had a GOP Senate staffer insert into a bill a provision that would change the rules so that federal
prosecutors could live outside their districts to serve in other jobs, according to documents and interviews... [T]he
episode, which received little notice at the time, provides another example in which Gonzales's statements appear to
conflict with simultaneous actions by his aides in connection with U.S. attorney policies. Washington Post: Residency
Clause Adds Fuel To Dispute Over U.S. Attorneys

"EXTRAORDINARY DISCORD AT HIGHEST LEVELS" OF WORLD BANK: Two former top officials at the World Bank have issued new
statements disputing the contention of Paul D. Wolfowitz, the bank president, that they and others knew about his
actions on behalf of his companion, who was employed there when he joined the bank in 2005, according to testimony
released Monday night and Tuesday. The officials' testimony, providing new details of their conversations with Mr.
Wolfowitz two years ago, laid bare the extraordinary discord at the highest levels of the bank after Mr. Wolfowitz
became president. At issue was how Mr. Wolfowitz should handle the possibility of a conflict of interest resulting from
his relationship with Shaha Ali Riza, who had been with the bank for seven years when he arrived. New York Times:
Former World Bank Officials Detail Discord Over Wolfowitz http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/02/washington/02wolfowitz.html


GOP-ERS ASK PELOSI TO SAVE TIPSTERS LEGISLATION: Key Republicans are lobbying House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to protect
legislation that prohibits airline passengers from being sued if they report suspicious behavior that foreshadows a
terrorist attack. Republican leaders used a procedural motion to insert that provision into a transportation-safety
bill last month, but House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer, Maryland Democrat, has threatened to bar from becoming law
all language entered into bills under such "motions to recommit." "We cannot afford to wait any longer to protect
individuals who seek to do the right thing by speaking up to prevent a terrorist attack," more than a dozen Republicans
wrote to Mrs. Pelosi, California Democrat, today in a letter obtained in advance by The Washington Times. Washington

RENZI'S "GROWING POLITICAL CRISIS": Rep. Rick Renzi paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in back taxes while settling
charges that his businesses improperly financed his first campaign for office, according to documents released Tuesday
by federal regulators. The Arizona Republican already faces a federal corruption inquiry over allegations that he tried
to use legislation for land swaps in Arizona to help a former business partner. He also is facing a growing political
crisis, which could include interest by the House ethics committee.  Tuesday's disclosure by the Federal Election
Commission threatens to revive the older scandal over whether Renzi broke campaign finance laws when first elected in
2002. Arizona Republic: Renzi's taxes telling http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/0502renzi0502.html

REAGAN DIARIES TO BE PUBLISHED: Ronald Reagan thought Alexander Haig was "utterly paranoid," considered former senator
Lowell Weicker "a pompous, no good fathead" and was "surprised at how shy" Michael Jackson was. Reagan also refused to
talk to his son after Ron Reagan hung up on him, felt that daughter Patti had "a kind of yo yo family relationship" and
was invariably "lonesome" when his wife, Nancy, was out of town. A self-portrait of the 40th president -- determined,
funny, wistful, at times clinging to his beliefs despite countervailing facts -- emerges from diaries that he
faithfully kept from 1981 to 1989, his eight years in the White House. Historian Spielas Brinkley had exclusive access
to the five hardback books bound in maroon leather, each page filled to the bottom with Reagan's neat handwriting.
Vanity Fair magazine, in its June issue, is publishing excerpts of the book "The Reagan Diaries," edited by Brinkley
and due out this month from publisher HarperCollins. Washington Post: Ronald Reagan, In His Own Words

GIULIANI'S "SOFTER TONE" ON IMMIGRATION: Addressing a group of Latino small business leaders, Mayor Giuliani yesterday
adopted a moderate stance on immigration, emphasizing the need to beef up security at the borders while maintaining
America's tradition as the world's most popular destination for people seeking a better life. Mr. Giuliani articulated
much the same position on immigration that he has on the campaign trail, but he began with a softer tone, casting the
country's attractiveness to immigrants as a strength to be preserved. " America is the country that more people want to
come to than any country, I think, in the history of the world," he said in a speech to the Latino Coalition, a
nonpartisan group that endorsed a mixture of Republicans and Democrats in 2006. "So before we reflect on our problems,
let's reflect on our strengths." New York Sun: Giuliani Adopts Moderate Stance on Immigration

LAW FIRM'S ENERGY LOBBYING MIGHT "POSE POLITICAL RISKS" FOR GIULIANI: [Rudy] Giuliani has drawn support from Texans who
were notable donors to President Bush, including a former Enron president, Richard D. Kinder, and business executives
who direct many of the nation's oil, gas and energy producers. And a good part of this success, analysts say, stems
from his affiliation with a well-established and politically connected law firm that is based in Houston and bears his
name, Bracewell & Giuliani. That affiliation adds to Mr. Giuliani's personal wealth but also could pose political risks
for him. The firm is perhaps the nation's most aggressive lobbyist for coal-fired power plants, heavy emitters of air
pollutants and carbon dioxide, a gas associated with global warming. New York Times: Giuliani's Tie to Texas Law Firm
May Pose Risk http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/02/us/politics/02giuliani.html

GIULIANI CALLS CHAVEZ "DANGEROUS TO U.S. INTERESTS": Presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani, whose law firm represents an
American subsidiary of a Hugo Chavez-controlled oil company, said Tuesday that the socialist Venezuelan president is
dangerous to U.S. interests. In a speech to Hispanic small business leaders, the Republican brought up Chavez while
discussing ways the United States could become free from its reliance on foreign oil. "Isn't it annoying, upsetting and
even in some cases a matter of national security that we have to send money to our enemies?" Giuliani asked. "We need a
president who knows how to get things done so we don't have to be sending money to Chavez." AP via Yahoo! News: Rudy
Giuliani assails Venezuela's Chavez http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070502/ap_on_el_pr/giuliani_chavez

McCAIN TALKS FOREIGN POLICY, DOES NOT SAY "IRAQ" IN HOOVER INSTITUTION SPEECH: Senator John McCain, a leading candidate
for the Republican nomination to be the next president, made a pilgrimage to the Hoover Institution yesterday to
address fellows and woo donors with a speech that outlined for the first time his plan to create a "League of
Democracies." Speaking before more than 150 people in an underground auditorium adjacent to the Hoover Tower, the
Arizona Republican took a hard line stance on Russia and China, criticized unilateralism, and called on the democratic
nations of the world to "strike a new grand bargain for the future."... In more than 3,000 words of prepared text that
he read from a teleprompter, McCain did not use the word "Iraq" once. But at a press conference after the address, the
senator defended the ongoing U.S. troop surge. Stanford Daily: McCain unveils democracy agenda

EDWARDS LEADS IN SOUTHERN FUNDRAISING: North Carolina's John Edwards says he's the only Democratic presidential
candidate with any chance of winning the coveted South. If early fundraising is any indication, he might be right.
Edwards placed a distant third behind Democrats Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama in first quarter fundraising,
tallying $14 million compared to Clinton's $26 million and Obama's $25 million. But in money raised in the South,
Edwards was the leader. From Louisiana to the Carolinas, Edwards easily beat his Democratic rivals and - perhaps more
importantly - raised more money than the top three Republican candidates combined. AP via Yahoo! News: Edwards
dominates money race in South http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070501/ap_on_el_pr/presidential_money_south

SCHWARZENEGGER "DETERMINED TO BE A FORCE" IN 2008: He may be sidelined by the Constitution, but Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger is determined to be a force in the 2008 presidential race, greeting candidates who want his endorsement
and popping up in campaign forums where he's certain to attract notice. On Tuesday, the governor met privately with
Republican candidate Mitt Romney in Sacramento. And Schwarzenegger will attend the GOP debate Thursday at the Ronald
Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley as a guest of Nancy Reagan. He has already made joint appearances with
Republican candidates John McCain and Rudolph W. Giuliani. Los Angeles Times: Governor positions himself to influence
