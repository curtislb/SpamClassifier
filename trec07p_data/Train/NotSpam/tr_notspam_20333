There's the British Museum cryptanalysis package which according to Chuck 
Hallenbech who wrote me about it earlier is pretty effective in doing its 
work.  Simtel mirrors many years ago had some very basic encryption and 
decryption packages on them and those may have been removed.  There's all 
kinds of password cracking utilities used by hackers to open up files that 
oughtn't be available to them too.  If you ever get any of those, please 
first run them through with clamscan and if you get a good report proceed 
with caution.  Finally, the data file formats handbook latest edition will 
probably provide a huge amount of help in certain instances.  Get the 
latest edition though since it gets updated just about every year.
