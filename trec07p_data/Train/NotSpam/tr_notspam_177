TONIGHT ON SHOWBIZ TONIGHT- CNN HEADLINE PRIME 11pm ET/ 11pm PT

OUTRAGE OVER IMUS
The anger over Imus! With more and more demands that Don Imus be fired for his racially insensitive remarks on the radio, is there really a chance he could lose his job? Tonight, Rev. Al Sharpton weighs in on the outrage, on TV's most provocative entertainment news show.

ANNA NICOLE SMITH: THE CUSTODY BATTLE
Explosive new developments, just hours before we're expected to find out if Larry Birkhead is the father of Anna Nicole's baby Dannielynn. Is Howard K. Stern really ready to give up the fight if Birkhead is the father? Also, what challenges will Dannielynn face growing up? Showbiz Tonight has all the angles covered.

WHY ARE MOVIES SO LONG?
Who has the time or the patience to sit through a movie that's longer than three hours? And that's not even counting the previews and commercials! So why in the world do the studios keep making painfully long movies? A Showbiz Tonight Special Report!

SHOWBIZ TONIGHT QUESTION OF THE DAY:
Don Imus: Should he be fired for his racial remarks?
