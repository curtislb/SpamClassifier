I disagree.
Donny does have valid points. And people do seem to jump on the fashionable
bandwagon, which is currently "carbon footprints" (and "organic farming",
although I didn't know anything inorganic could ever grow).

And on the topic of organic farming (since I brought it up), I find
it interesting after a few years of that fad, that many scientists
are now showing that "organic" products are not any tastier, nor any
better nutrient-wise, and that fertilizing with sh*t carries way more
risks and contains nasty by-products.

Humans really don't have a clue, do they!
