This is not critical.

Problem number one.

You seem to have two problems:

1) graphics card

Try to comment out the "VideoRam 4000" line from xorg.conf. If this does
not make the error go away then you have to reduce your resolution
and/or DefaultDepth. I think this error is not the reason for X to fail
completely, but your graphics rendering will be significantly faster and
use less CPU cycles if you get the DRI (direct rendering infrastructure)
going.

2) mouse and touchpad

There is a problem with the device node for mouse and touchpad. Try to
do "modprobe psmouse" as root and check if you can start X after that.
If this does not help then we need the output of these two commands:

ls -l /dev/input/by-id
awk '/Section "InputDevice"/,/EndSection/' /etc/X11/xorg.conf

Another thing to try is to add 

Option "AllowMouseOpenFail"  "true"

to the ServerFlags section of your xorg.conf (see "man xorg.conf"). This
will at least tell you if it is really the mouse issue that keeps X from
starting.
