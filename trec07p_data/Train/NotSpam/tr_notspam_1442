Sounds great, could you please start a new thread and explain briefly
how these scripts are working in Debian-BR-CDD ? I'm sure that we
shouldn't add them into desktop-base though, since the user can decide
remove the automount feature (and the package) but keep with the
default artwork. Let us keep desktop-base for artwork and strict
related stuff and prepare a new source package.

Sounds great except for the CCHost licensing issues. :( Anyway, please
make sure that the artwork submitted won't be tainted by CC non-free
license, if in doubt ask here or in debian-legal mailing list. I'm
looking forward for the goodies from the Debian Artwork project.
