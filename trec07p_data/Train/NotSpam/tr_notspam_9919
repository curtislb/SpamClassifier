It *must* be decided on a case-by-case basis: no general rule can be
drawn from a specific decision, because what is source in one case, can
be compiled form in another.

This holds even for programs, not only for audio, video and similar
stuff.
Imagine we decided that C code is "always source": that would be a wrong
oversimplification, because there are quite some cases where C code is
generated from some other form (typical examples: parser code generated
from a grammar description by Bison, or C code automatically translated
from a higher level language).

Hence, each case has to be examined to determine which is the source.

As I said, we cannot reach any reasonable *general* conclusion about a
format.
In some cases an Ogg Vorbis file qualifies as source, because maybe it's
the preferred form for making modification to a work.  In other cases,
an Ogg Vorbis file does not qualify.

Art does not need any special-casing (and anyway the boundaries of "art"
are quite blurred: some programs can be so elegant to be considered
"art"...).
Source code is defined as the form of a work which is preferred for
making modifications to it.

P.S.: I am instead subscribed to debian-legal, so please do *not* Cc:
me, as long as debian-legal is in the loop!
