My take on how a modified BY-SA could work follows...

It is reasonable, but it is not the only reasonable way to do SA.

OK,

here goes (rough thoughts so far)

A modified BY-SA could work along these lines...

If you make a derivative of the work, you must put BY-SA on the derivative.

If you use the work in another work where a copyright arises, the work getting 
the copyright must be BY-SA and any works also used in the larger work must 
be compatible with BY-SA for use in collections and the like.

This would not attempt to force a BY-SA license on works used alongside a 
BY-SA work in a collection, but it would require the collection as a whole to 
be BY-SA and it would limit the licenses on works used in the collection to 
ones which carry a "compatible for collections" license.

As a first cut on "compatible for collections" licneses, they would need to be 
Free.

Perhaps the over all work would only need to carry such a license and not 
BY-SA itself. I don't know how copyrights work on collections. If so, then 
since the works used alongside the BY-SA work and the overall work are not 
derivatives (or would not necessarily be?) actual derivatives of the BY-SA 
work, they could be licensed in other ways when not in the presence of hte 
BY-SA work.

In cases where no copyright would arise from putting the BY-SA work together 
with other works, none of this would apply.

First, have I been clear in the above?

Second, have I failed to cover some inportant point(s)?

Third, benefits of such an approach over the current BY-SA?

Fourth, costs of such an approach over the current BY-SA?

Fifth, overall, would you prefer such an approach to the current BY-SA 
approach?
