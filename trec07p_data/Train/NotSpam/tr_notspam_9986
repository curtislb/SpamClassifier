A couple more comments, sorry about the double post. I did want to
point out that even though your friend hasn't changed her password, it
is possible that /etc/shadow and/or /etc/passwd got corrupted. Also,
in the correctly spelled second thread, someone suggested using single
user mode. However, as far as I know, you still have to login even
then, so that might not work.

Greg
