One of my clients implemented reverse DNS lookup and it stopped my email
going through.

email is generated from user@internal.mydomain.com.au  reverse DNS looks
up where the email is supposed to come from ie internal.mydomain.com.au
and it fails because this is not a public machine address.

Solution was to fiddle the email address to remove the machine name.
