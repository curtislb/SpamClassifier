An anonymous reader writes "A British judge admitted on Wednesday he was
struggling to cope with basic terms like "Web site" in the trial of three
men accused of inciting terrorism via the Internet. Judge Peter Openshaw
broke into the questioning of a witness about a Web forum used by alleged
Islamist radicals. "The trouble is I don't understand the language. [0]I
don't really understand what a Web site is". he told a London court
during the trial of three men charged under anti-terrorism laws.
Prosecutor Mark Ellison briefly set aside his questioning to explain the
terms "Web site" and "forum." An exchange followed in which the
59-year-old judge acknowledged: "I haven't quite grasped the concepts.""

Hitachi's solution is to replace the zinc with a fine powder of

making it a much better conductor."

[0]earthlingpink writes about the ongoing DDoSing of Estonia. The
Guardian is reporting that [1]Russia stands accused of engaging in a
three-week-long series of cyber-attacks. Government, banking, and media
websites have been targeted. It is unclear whether the attacks are
sanctioned or initiated by the Russian Government, but Estonian
authorities believe that to be the case. NATO has sent security experts
to Tallinn to help beef up defenses. The Estonian defense minister said,
"At present, NATO does not define cyber-attacks as a clear military
action. This means that the provisions of... collective self-defense,
will not automatically be extended to the attacked country... this matter
needs to be resolved in the near future."

An anonymous reader writes "A paper was recently published about Shift at
the Computer Human Interaction Conference earlier this month. The authors
(Daniel Vogel, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Toronto and Patrick
Baudisch, a research scientist at Microsoft Research) developed the
technology to [0]solve several problems with mobile-phone touch screens.
Most such screens are designed to be operated with a stylus; when touched
with a finger the UI doesn't work so well. They also created a short
video with a demonstration of how Shift works. Shift builds on an
existing technology known as Offset Cursor, which displays a cursor just
above the spot a user touches on the screen. That allows a user to place
their finger below the item they wish to choose so that they can see the
item, rather than hiding it with their finger."

ultimate [0]futility of fighting online pirates. From the article: 'As
the world's largest repository of BitTorrent files, ThePirateBay.org
helps millions of users around the world share copyrighted movies, music
and other files — without paying for them ... That's illegal, of course —
at least it is in the U.S. But when Time Warner's (nyse: TWX — news —

in 2005, the pirates gleefully reminded the movie company that they
didn't live in America, but rather in the land of vikings, reindeer,
Aurora Borealis and cute blond girls.' The article also touches on the
many YouTube clones and AllofMP3.com."

CVG has up a piece noting the fact that not much about Zelda games have
changed since the move to 3D. Chalk that up to the greatness of Ocarina
of Time if you will, but the same mirror moving, fire-arrow switch
activating puzzles have been in the last several titles. Is it time for
some kind of [0]radical change to the equation? "People generally don't
like to accept change. But change doesn't always spell disaster. Final
Fantasy introduces a totally new cast, setting and theme with each sequel
and continues to please fans. Resident Evil 4 completely revolutionised
Capcom's horror series and is now viewed as one of the best games ever
made ... We still totally adore Zelda but eventually the appeal will tire
and the series risks bombing. Nintendo needs to take the bold step and
inject something totally new into Zelda. We're not talking about a couple
of new items, or a new location - that's been done. We mean a significant
change that affects the whole structure and gameplay."

[0]Spy Handler writes "Researchers analyzing bullet fragments from the
1963 Kennedy assassination using new techniques say that the government's
1976 conclusion that [1]the bullets came from only one gun (Oswald's) is
wrong. 'Using new guidelines set forth by the National Academy of
Sciences for proper bullet analysis, Tobin and his colleagues at Texas
A&M re-analyzed the bullet evidence used by the 1976 House Select
Committee on Assassinations, which concluded that only one shooter,
Oswald, fired the shots that killed Kennedy in Dallas. The committee's
finding was based in part on the research of now-deceased University of
California at Irvine chemist Vincent P. Guinn. He used bullet lead
analysis to conclude that the five bullet fragments recovered from the
Kennedy assassination scene came from just two bullets, which were traced
to the same batch of bullets Oswald owned.'"

release of AACS, which is intended to fix the currently compromised
version. The only problem is, [1]the patched version has already been
cracked. From the article: 'AACS LA's attempts to stifle dissemination of
AACS keys and prevent hackers from compromising new keys are obviously
meeting with extremely limited success. The hacker collective continues
to adapt to AACS revisions and is demonstrating a capacity to assimilate
new volume keys at a rate which truly reveals the futility of resistance.
If keys can be compromised before HD DVDs bearing those keys are even
released into the wild, one has to question the viability of the entire
key revocation model.'"

abhinav_pc writes "Wired is carrying an article pondering [0]whether
Firefox has become big and bloated, much like IE. As the browser's
popularity has risen, the interest in cramming more features into the
product has as well. Slowdowns and feature creep have some users asking
for a return to the days of the 'slim and sexy' Firefox. 'Firefox's
page-cache mechanism, for example, introduced in version 1.5, stores the
last eight visited pages in the computer's memory. Caching pages in
memory allows faster back browsing, but it can also leave a lot less
memory for other applications to use. Less available RAM equals a
less-responsive computer. Firefox addresses this issue somewhat, setting
the default cache lower on computers with less than a gigabyte of RAM.
Though the jury is still out on where the perfect balance between too
many and too few features lies, one truth is apparent: The new web is
pushing our browsers to the limit.'"

[1]Hitachi Deskstar 7K1000 1TB Hard Drive, which ushers in the terabyte
age. It performs well on HDTach and PCMark benchmarks, though not as
speedily as professional-grade drives. It could be just the ticket for
digital media junkies. 'One of the first issues to note is that you may
not see an actual one terabyte capacity on your system. First, the
formatted capacity is always less than the raw space available on the
drive. Directory information and formatting data always take up some
space. Second, the hard drive industry's definition of a megabyte differs
from the rest of the PC business. One megabyte of hard drive space is
1,000,000 bytes: 10^6 bytes. Operating systems calculate one megabyte as
2^20 bytes, or 1,048,576 bytes. Once installed and set up, Hitachi's 1TB
hard drive offers up an actual formatted capacity of about 935GB, as
measured by the OS. That's still a lot of space, by anyone's
definition.'" Update: 05/17 21:52 GMT by [2]Z : Adding '^s' missing from

| Is Dedicated Hosting for Critical DTDs Necessary?                  |

pcause asks: "Recently there was a glitch, when someone at Netscape took
down a page that had an important DTD (for RSS), used by many
applications and services. This got me thinking that many or all of the
important DTDs that software and commerce depend on are hosted at various
commercial entities. Is this a sane way to build an XML based Internet
infrastructure? Companies come and go all of the time; this means that
the storage and availability of those DTDs is in constant jeopardy. It
strikes me that we need an infrastructure akin to the root server
structure to hold the key DTDs that are used throughout the industry.
What organization would be the likely custodian of such data, and what
would be the best way to insure such an infrastructure stays funded?"

[0]Roland Piquepaille writes "In a short article, Popular Science reports
that researchers at the University of Washington have built [1]a robotic
cable inspection system. This system should help utility companies to
[2]maintain their networks of subterranean cables. The robot, dubbed
Cruiser, is about 4-feet-long and is designed like a snake. When it
detects an anomaly on an underground cable, it sends a message to a human
operator via Wi-Fi. The first field tests took place in New Orleans in
December 2006. But a commercial version should not be available before
2012."
