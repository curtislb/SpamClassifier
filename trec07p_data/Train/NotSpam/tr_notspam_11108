Summary: COMMUNITY: user-generated tasks contests/productions/request

Initial Comment:
Basically, users need a clear way to generate tasks,
requests for content, and in terms of previous
verbiage, need to be able to generate their own
contests that identify a goal, a reward, and a timeline.

This will give the community new life for generating
its own content and contests...

I think this shoudl generally be called a task system
and then allow users to select: production, contest,
request, forhire

This way, various levels of involvement can bubble-up
from the bottom of the community rather than be a top
down endeavour.

A task system along with a reputation system is what
make s World of Warcraft and so many other massive
communities work effectively and be self-fed.
