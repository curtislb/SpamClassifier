Thanks to everyone for the replies.

 I expected what you pointed out above, that /\b(w+)\s+(\w+)\s+/gs would
match every instance of the pattern. Instead I got wildly results, with
random letters in some variables and the values I wanted in a different
offset every time. I cannot explain that, but the pattern works with the
left hand values written as literals (/\b(word)\s+(.*)\s+/)

This can be treated as key/values delimited by whitespace.

I wonder if the unexpected results could be related to tabs or something
else besides \n? How do I see what's used for white space? Shouldn't \s
match any whitespace character?

Thanks. That's cool. Since this is the beginner's list, I'll just dive in
and ask a(nother) dumb question. I'm not sure I understand the double curly
braces around split. Would you mind showing me that in a less terse form?
