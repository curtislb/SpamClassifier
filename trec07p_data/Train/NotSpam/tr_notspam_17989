For some there's a convenience issue, they don't like physical storage.  I
find that ironic because CD was intended as "the" long term storage
solution, when HDDs were flakey and FDD more so.  HDD technology has
advanced so much in the last 10 years, also flash memory technology, not
forgetting the yet-to-be on-line storage "for all" solution.

So, I agree there's something nostalgic rather than practical about wanting
something on a CD, vinyl or any kind of tactile media of yesteryear.
However, I do feel there's something missing from the mix of medias these
days.  t-shirts have maintained their popularity, whilst printed materials
are more than lacking in imagination, mostly due to the space restrictions.

I've agreed previously with some of Drew's suggestions with regard to
reproduction of artwork, something you can hang on your wall.  Some old
album art I'm seriously considering framing up and putting on walls.  I'd
never consider doing this with CD artwork due to the size, and artwork I've
seen downloaded with online audio purchases is little more than a thumbnail.
I'm sure there's a merchandise opportunity waiting to happen for some
enterprising internet entrepreneur who simply provides A4/letter-size cover
art as an accompanying download.  It's all about adding value in my mind.

Speaking of value add and quality issues.....

>From the selfish perspective of a virtual musician wanting to deliver his
art in it's optimum form (yes I include myself in that description) a CD is
nowadays an inferior "format".  16bit Stereo 44.1KHz?  Only makes sense if
you're mastering for some gad-awful 90s technology like MP3 ;)

DVD-audio http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD-Audio has a much more interesting
set of options.  For instance I record most of my instrumentation via Cubase
at 24bit 192KHz on a "low cost" audio card made by E-MU.  You CAN hear the
difference on half-way decent speakers.  It makes me queasy to think that
people are paying money to various online outlets for low quality lossy
audio.  It's an age-old gripe, but I feel it's a valid one.

My suggestion would be to forget about CD audio, that's replaced effectively
by the lossless codecs like flac and ape (which you should prefer btw).
Push the technology envelope, put yourself out there on the edge ;) ....have
the artists master their work in hi-def, surround sound if they wish!

Just my 2p....good luck with the project! :D
