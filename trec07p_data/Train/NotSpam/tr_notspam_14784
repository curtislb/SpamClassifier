Christian,

The formula language is not suited to such recursive useage 
AFAICS.

You can _vectorize_ your code like this:

cmat <- outer( 1:25, 1:25, function(y,x) ifelse( x>y, 0, 0.8^(y-x) ) )
res <- replicate(1000,{
 	y <- 1 + cmat %*% rnorm(25)
 	coef(lm(y[-1]~y[-25]))
 			})
rowMeans(res) # mean of 1000 replicates

HTH,

Chuck
