You can, but that's rapidly sliding into "obfuscation" territory.  You already
have the data... why shove it out as a filehandle and back in line by line,
when all you need to do is split the data up by lines?

string-as-filehandle is mostly to work around legacy systems that want a
filehandle but you actually want the data in memory.  Don't invent *new*
interfaces that *require* their use.  Ugh.
