I think it isn't. Freedom to make changes is required under the DFSG,
and this license doesn't grant that freedom: it restricts it with the
(vague) "as long as the alteration does not significantly alter the
content".

Whatever "significantly" means, it's non-DFSG-free to forbid changes
to the work that are "significant".
