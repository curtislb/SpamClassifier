>From the help page

      'pdf' writes uncompressed PDF.  It is primarily intended for
      producing PDF graphics for inclusion in other documents, and
      PDF-includers such as 'pdftex' are usually able to handle
      compression.

If you are able to contribute a stream compressor, R will produce smaller 
plots.  Otherwise it is unlikely to happen (and it any case would be a
smaller contribution than that of the author of pdf(), who is quite happy 
with external compressors).

Acrobat does other things (not all of which it tells you about), but 
compression is the main advantage.
