Too Many Lawyers

Bang Bang

Zap Zap

-----

Long ago I read an article that reported on the correlation between a
country's economic growth rate and the percentage of lawyers in that
country.  The conclusion: a country with too few lawyers lacks the legal
structure that enables open markets and the flow of capital to wherever
it's treated best.  Contrarily, a country with too many lawyers finds
itself bogged down by excessive lawmaking and red tape.  Somewhere in the
middle, the author argued, was an optimum level.

Of course, economics is an exceedingly complex business, and there are
numerous factors that are even more important than the number of lawyers.

But a fair amount of evidence suggests that the U.S. now has more lawyers
than it needs.

For example, two-thirds of the world's lawyers are now found in the U.S.,
and law schools continue to produce some 40,000 more every year.  Because
supply exceeds demand, not all of them end up in the legal profession, and
no doubt that's a good thing.

But enough of them get there to cause trouble, like the fellow who's suing
his dry cleaner for $54 million over the loss of a pair of pants.  That he
tarnishes both his profession and his own reputation in the process is a
given.  Anyone with half a brain can see that $54 million is a
ridiculously inappropriate number.  Yet the plaintiff carries on,
confident that the potential reward outweighs the certain costs of time,
money and loss of reputation and proving, in the process, the old saw that
the lawyer who represents himself has a fool for a client.

I wonder what his mother thinks.

Sticking to lawyers (assuming that most politicians are lawyers) and
begging your indulgence, I'll descend for a spell into the morass of
national politics, where poll numbers and a good haircut matter more than
ideas and honesty.

Normally, I steer clear of politics in these letters.  I know you're
reading this for investment ideas (they're coming), and I know from
experience that some people can get touchy when it comes to political
opinions.  But I can't resist commenting on this week's development.

In short, New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg announced that he had
dropped out of the Republican Party and is now unaffiliated with any party
.  My response, in the word of Teddy Roosevelt: "Bully!"  The only thing
better would be to have Hillary and Mitt and Barack and Rudy do the same,
so we can have a chance to learn what they, as true individuals, really
think, and not what they think their respective parties want to hear.

And I know I'm not alone.  After all, between 30% and 40% of voters
nationally belong to neither the Republican nor the Democratic Party.  In
Alaska, the percentage is 60%, in New Jersey 59% and in Massachusetts 50%.
 These people are sick of the two-party system in which each party's
biggest priority is self-perpetuation.  They want politicians who can work
together to do the right thing in solving our country's problems.  They
want less influence by lobbyists and special interest groups and more
attention paid to what's right for the country as a whole.  And given the
right candidate, they'll vote for him or her.

Now, technically, Bloomberg is not running for President.  But that's part
of the game.  Given his fortune, legally earned by serving the needs of
investors, he can afford to delay an official entry into the race.

And if he does declare, I wish him luck.  I appreciate a man (or woman)
who can break from the party ranks to stand alone for ideas that he (or
she) believes in.  I like Lieberman for breaking free from the Democrats
in Connecticut.  I like Schwarzenegger for daring to be a different kind
of Republican in California.  And hey, I even appreciate that old
socialist from Vermont, Bernie Sanders, just because he's neither a
Democrat nor a Republican!

So now on to guns, where I have both a traditional and a "space-age"
investment idea.

Of course, guns, like politics, tend to incite passions.  But this
section's not about my opinions; it's about the stocks themselves.  I
learned long ago that the market is always right, and because the stocks
of both these companies are going up, I think they're both worth writing
about . . . and perhaps investing in.

On the traditional side, there's Smith & Wesson Holding Corp (SWHC), which
traces its roots back to 1852.  Smith & Wesson, in fact, is the #1 maker
of handguns in the U.S.  Its manufacturing facilities are in Springfield,
Massachusetts and Houlton, Maine.

In 1987, the company was bought by Tomkins PLC, a British conglomerate,
for $112 million, and things went okay for while.  Then in 2000 the
company signed an agreement with the Clinton administration (in order to
avoid lawsuits) saying it would add safety features to all its products. 
But the resulting boycotts from gun clubs and gun rights groups so damaged
sales that the company was sold a year later to Saf-T-Hammer - run by a
former Smith & Wesson executive who had previously left Tomkins - for just
$15 million.

>From today's perspective, that was a huge bargain!  The market has now
accepted the safety features in Smith & Wesson guns and today, six years
later, the company is valued by the market at $640 million!

Credit good management for the turnaround.  Smith & Wesson has introduced
new models of handguns to the market, targeted to both the law enforcement
and sporting markets.  No longer restricting itself to revolvers, it's
branched out into pistols, and with them it's fast winning new law
enforcement contracts.  It's increased its use of plastics, thus lowering
both weight and cost.  It's revamped its sporting goods sales force so
that it's comprised entirely of employees instead of manufacturers'
representatives.  And it's partnered with companies like Walther to
co-manufacture handguns.

And now it's getting into the long-gun business!  In January Smith &
Wesson spent $102 million to buy Thomson/Center Arms, a New Hampshire
manufacturer of hunting rifles and black powder muzzleloaders.  And it's
introduced its own line of shotguns.  In short, it's using the venerable
Smith & Wesson name, and the cash from its IPO, to grow through both
diversification and acquisition.  More acquisitions are likely.

But perhaps the biggest growth could come from the U.S. government.   
Smith & Wesson's new pistols have won the company four orders from the
Department of Defense in recent years; some are for firearms in
Afghanistan.  But there's been nothing big yet; orders from the federal
government account for just $5 million per quarter.  Looking ahead though,
there's hope that the government will replace its 9-millimeter pistols
with more powerful sidearms, like Smith & Wesson's new .45 caliber pistol.
 If so, that would really light a fire under the stock.

Not that it's doing badly now.  Smith and Wesson (SWHC) has earned a spot
in Cabot Top Ten Report five times in the past ten months, most recently
in April.  And readers who bought on any one of those recommendations -
and held on - are happy today, as the stock is hitting new highs.  If you
choose to buy, try to do so during a corrections.

My other gun story - the space-age one - is about Taser (TASR).

A Taser (an acronym of Thomas A. Swift Electric Rifle) is technically not
a gun.  It doesn't shoot projectiles.  It shoots darts that remain
attached to the hand-held Taser by small wires that then deliver pulses of
electricity to the target, effectively incapacitating him (it's almost
always a him) by disrupting neuromuscular function.

Back in 2003-2004, the Cabot Market Letter's Model Portfolio owned Taser
and rode it to a profit of 296%.  Why did we sell?  Because the stock
turned down.

And why did the stock turn down?  Because of growing fears by both
investors and police departments (the main buyers of Tasers) of the
growing number of lawsuits against the company.  The fears by police
departments led to shrinking revenues, and the fears by investors led to a
tumbling stock price.  Top-to-bottom, Taser lost 84% of its value!

But the bottom did come.  Police departments did resume ordering.   
Tasers are now in use or in tests by 4,300 law enforcement agencies in the
U.S. and Canada.  And the company recently completed its 50th successful
defense against a wrongful death or injury lawsuit.  In fact, the company
has never lost a product liability lawsuit!

The conclusion, as we believed years ago, is that Tasers are safe.   
More important, they reduce injuries and deaths of both law enforcement
officers and suspects, and that leads to a raft of benefits for all
parties.

Taser actually makes models for both professionals and consumers.   
The professional models use wires that are 35 feet long, while the
consumer model uses wires that are just 15 feet long.  In a shoot-out
involving a professional and consumer, the professional wins.

There's growing interest from international customers; last week the
company announced that a foreign international law enforcement agency had
ordered 1,375 units.  And there's talk that the new law-and-order
president of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, would like to arm all of France's
250,000 police officers with Tasers.

Finally, coming on July 7 is the official introduction of the company's
long-awaited extended range electronic projectile (XREP).   
Expelled from a 12-gauge shotgun, the new product will dispense with wires
and use "microprocessor-controlled intelligent electrode selection
technologies" in a self-contained projectile.

The company is keeping a tight lid on the details until then, but we know
it has been tested by the U.S. military "at ranges up to 30 meters." 
Furthermore, "Mr. Stephen Kunich, representing the Air Force Air Combat
Command Security Forces, volunteered for a five-second exposure . . .
After the exposure, Mr. Kunich commented, "The effect locked up muscles
and totally overwhelmed the senses.  I was completely incapacitated. 
Additionally, I was amazed at the instantaneous physical recovery.  There
isn't much doubt of full compliance after exposure to a TASER weapon like
XREP.""

There's investment risk, of course. At $12, this is still a fairly
low-priced stock, and that means volatility is a given.  Furthermore, the
stock has gained 50% in the past two months, so a correction that gives
some of that back would not be unusual.

But long-term, we expect the move to non-lethal weapons to continue to
grow.  We like the fact that this is a global business. We like the
company's patents, and the fact that they're the leader in the industry. 
And because the company has penetrated roughly 20% of the domestic
law-enforcement market and less than 5% of the worldwide market, there's
clearly terrific growth potential.

If you're attracted to it as an investment, I suggest that you buy
carefully, ideally on a pullback, and that you be careful to keep losses
small.

Editor's note:

The Cabot Market Letter recommended Taser this week, but didn't add it to
its portfolio . . . yet.  The Model Portfolio is already loaded with
stocks . . . and it's up 19% year-to-date.  But in the future, anything
could happen.  To stay abreast of all the Cabot Market Letter's
top-performing stocks (like Crocs, up nearly 200% since its
recommendation), consider a no-risk trial subscription today.  To get
