TONIGHT ON SHOWBIZ TONIGHT- CNN HEADLINE PRIME 11pm ET/ 11pm PT

<b>ROSIE VS. ELISABETH ON "THE VIEW"!</b>
The political bickering between Rosie O'Donnell and Elisabeth Hasselbeck gets downright nasty and turns into a knock-down, drag-out fight you absolutely have to see to belive! The play-by-play, tonight on TV's most provocative entertainment news show.

<b>LINDSAY'S ALCOHOL SHOCKER!</b>
Fresh out of rehab and attending AA meetings, Lindsay Lohan is about to celebrate her 21st birthday -- and there are reports that a <i>vodka</i> company is sponsoring the bash! Is this really true? What could she be thinking? The answers, on Showbiz Tonight.

<b>IS HOLLYWOOD FRESH OUT OF IDEAS?</b>
It's the year of the silver screen sequel! Spider-Man, Pirates, Bourne, Shrek, the list goes on and on, and it's all well and good, but Showbiz Tonight has to ask -- are there "any" new ideas left in Hollywood? We go searching, tonight.

<b>SHOWBIZ TONIGHT QUESTION OF THE DAY:</b>
Bible-toting Paris Hilton: Is it just a publicity stunt?
