No the benefit is in reducing the complexity of allocation. As you  
allocate more different types of object, the code moves closer to  
being a general purpose allocator. That's not something I want to  
write or maintain, and as it becomes more complex it is harder to grow  
the mmap.

That depends on exactly what you want.

If you think that smbprofile.h is OK for client apps, then it should  
be standalone. IMHO smbprofile.h is not the right solution for this,  
and from the sounds of the above, you have some changes.
