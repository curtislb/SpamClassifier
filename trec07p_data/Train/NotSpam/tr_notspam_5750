Here's a note from Bill Lagattuta on Saturday's 48 Hours Mystery, Murder in=
 the Fast Lane:=20

"The story of Mickey Thompson is the story of a genuine American hero--the =
man who at one time was the fastest man on earth. He was a down-to-earth ra=
cing icon, a tough businessman, an innovator and he was married to the love=
 of his life, Trudy. It all came to a horrible end almost twenty years ago =
when Mickey and Trudy were gunned down, execution style, in the driveway of=
 their Los Angeles area home. I remember covering this story as a young new=
s reporter, and it's fitting for me to be present at the final chapter.=20

>From the beginning, the focus of the investigation was Mickey Thompson's co=
lorful business partner, Mike Goodwin. But there was no physical evidence t=
o tie him to the crimes. For the past two decades, through a series of fasc=
inating twists and turns, detectives and Thompson's hard-driving sister Col=
leen have been pursuing Goodwin, hoping his flamboyant personality and his =
big mouth would be his undoing. In our program this week, we will take you =
step by step through this fascinating case... and you'll be able to watch w=
hat many considered the surprise ending in court. Murder in the Fast Lane w=
as an amazing story for me to live, and to report. I hope you will join us =
on Saturday night."=20
