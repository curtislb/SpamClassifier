One thing with which I struggled when browsing in *nix is that there is no 
virtual browse mode.  You are pretty much viewing the screen as a sighted 
person would see it; exactly as the web author intended for it to appear. 
This is why your arrow keys do not work.  Also, this is why we prefer to 
number links because it is often difficult to tell where the links are. 
When you are confronted with a new site, read it in its entirety, which is 
what you should do anyways, then go back to the top and search for what you 
need with the / (slash) key.
