index is definitely defined in my version ( 2.4.0) because when I do
?index, I get info. Maybe you
Are using an older or younger version of R ? I'm really not sure why you
are experiencing that problem.

Thanks,

no index function was defined in R.

I try to use the split(order(temp), temp), the number of groups are
correct, however the result doesnot seem to be correct. I try to match
before the ordered index and the original index.
