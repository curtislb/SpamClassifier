That's exactly what I was thinking.  I know I fixed some leaks the other day 
which might help somewhat, but if we're not freeing Strings properly, there's 
a problem.

Another possibility is that these PMCs get marked inappropriately when they're 
no longer reachable from P-regs.  I find that more difficult to believe, but 
it's possible.
