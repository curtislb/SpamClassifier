There is no order in a hash.
I wouldn't call a hash array as its confusing personally.
If you require order then you can either add another sort to your hash i.e.
make it 3 level with a numerical sort.
Or use a list with a list of hashes.
You can also use Tie::Hash

Hi Guys...

 I have checked the following file..

#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;
my ($a,$b);
my %array = ("jan",1,"Feb",2,"Mar",3);
while (($a,$b)= each(%array))
{print $a.$b. "\n";}


the output is like that,

jan1
Mar3
Feb2

What is order of retrieving the values from Hash??  


Thanks,
Siva
