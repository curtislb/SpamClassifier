The variable-sized proposal just allocates differently (non-resizable) PMCs. 
Same thing as we are already allocating differently sized GC-able items 
(PObjs) namely: PMC, Buffer, String, and Buffer-like. The only differences 
are some flag bits and the presence of a vtable.

This is what the cstruct-Proposal is for. The cstruct is describing the 
internals of a PMC (which happen to consist of C structure items)
