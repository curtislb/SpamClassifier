A program in command line that works might be too long under Windows, but if 
it is necessary it could be made sending the list of files to the program 
with a pipe, like:

dir /b | perl -e "print <STDIN>;"

This command prints the list of filenames on the console, and the dos 
command dir accepts wildcards, then the perl program could do anything with 
those files, like opening them, modifying....
