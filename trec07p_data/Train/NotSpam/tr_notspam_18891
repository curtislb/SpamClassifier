Yeap...
Congratulations to d-i team for this theme.

But, I think the pallet color (used by gtk theme and upper bar image)
is different of used by default desktop, creating a failure on visual
identity of system. :(

Can we prepare an other GTK theme, using other gtk2 engine?

Yeap.. I can help with it...

About the images/icons, the artists of DebianArt can help and we can
create a contest on DebianArt for receive ideas...
