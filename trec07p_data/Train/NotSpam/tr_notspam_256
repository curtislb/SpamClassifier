I think I now understand your comments. I've used snow and Rmpi quite
a bit. But the problem with Rmpi (or, rather, MPI) is the lack of
fault tolerance: if a node goes down, the whole MPI universe breaks,
and thus the complete set of slaves. Setting up some kind of
fault-tolerant scheme with Rserve seemed possible/simpler (as it does
not depend on the MPI layer).

(Yes, maybe I should check snowFT, but it uses PVM, and I recall a
while back there was a reason why we decided to go with MPI instead of
PVM).

Aha. I should have seen that. I think I understand the differences better now.

Yes, sure. I think that should be doable, though, if I decide to try
to go down this route.

It does help! Thanks a lot.
