Note that, in the UK at least, adding a "free" CD jacks up the cost of a 
printed manual/book significantly. Given that a typical O'Reilly sells 
for between £20 and £40, adding a CD will also add about £5 tax to the 
price (books are VAT-free, adding a CD makes the *entire* *package* 
liable to 17.5% tax).
