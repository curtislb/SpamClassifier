Yes, I do that too (to c:\R, in my case). I don't know whether Vista
considers c:\R a system area; if not, making c:\R the default would avoid
problems for sole users.

Assuming that c:\R is not a system area, the question is what's the best
default location for installing R. I suspect that most people who use R on
Windows are using it on sole-user machines, and are not used to
differentiating between administrator and other accounts. Vista will make
them attend to this distinction, and they may well get in the habit of
installing software as an administrator. This would lead to the kinds of
problems that have been surfacing: Difficulty installing packages as an
unprivileged user after doing a default install of R as an administrator.

Sysadmins, on the other hand, tend to be more sophisticated, and could
install R to c:\Program Files\R even if the default location is c:\R.

Yes, I recall that. I agree that the change made sense at the time.

I think that the general principle should be to choose defaults to cause the
least difficulty, especially to unsophisticated users. Perhaps the
implications of that have changed with Vista. As I said, I don't currently
have a Vista machine, so none of this is based on experience.

 John
