Hi,

As part of an ongoing effort to bring our kernel tree closer with the 
mainline kernel (ideally identical) we have opted to drop the speakup 
patch from our tree.

We have found it fairly difficult to maintain and it has not seen the 
kind of usage that the graphical systems (Orca, etc) have.

It seems that many speakup users traditionally prefer to compile their 
own kernel, which will of course still be an option, and as Ubuntu 
approaches a fairly standard kernel this should be fairly easy.

This does by no means mean that we are reducing our focus on 
accessibility. We have a range of new projects in the works both for the 
visually impaired and other groups. See: 
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Accessibility/Specs

Henrik


ps. I originally sent this on 30/04, but as was not subscribed it must 
have bounced
