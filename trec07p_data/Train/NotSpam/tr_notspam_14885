The () there very specifically say "This subroutine takes no
arguments".

... and yet you're retrieving arguments from the subroutine.

The & there specifically says to ignore the prototype (ie, how many
arguments the subroutine says it needs).  So first you tell your
subroutines "don't take any arguments", and then you tell them "ignore
what I just told you."  Stop doing that.

Where the heck did this subroutine come from?  The subroutine you
called above is called deleteposter_file.  And you're again telling it
it takes no arguments, even though you passed arguments to it.

What?  You're not calling this subroutine as a method.  Why are you
thinking it has an object reference as the first argument?

>         my $file_path = @_;

This sets $file_path equal to the number of arguments left in @_
(after you shifted off $self).  It does not set $file_path equal to
the first element of @_.  For that, you want either:
my ($file_path) = @_;
or
my $file_path = shift;
or
my $file_path = $_[0];

> # extract the file name
> #       my @parts = split('\/',$file_path);

Why are you commenting this out?  Why are you not checking for
errors?  Why are you not printing $file to see what it is?

unlink $file or die "Cannot unlink '$file': $!";

> #       if( -e "file" ) {

"file" is not the same thing as $file.

even if you change it to $file, you're looking for $file in the
current directory, even though you just determined it may not be
located in that directory, because you were originally passed a full
path.

again,
unlink $file_path or die "Cannot unlink '$file_path': $!";

You didn't ask it to.  system calls don't report errors unless you
check for an error and print the error out yourself.
