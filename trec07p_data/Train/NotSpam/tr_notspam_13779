And no, it's not a well-established word in that regard. Like many
terms in the Copyright/Trademark/Patent rights space, it gets missused
by people who are not familiar with it and haven't bothered to consult
a dictionary.

If you mean non-free, just say non-free. Don't use confusing terms
like proprietary, which belongs on the closed/open axis, not the
free/non-free axis. Non-free is even shorter that proprietary, so your
fingers will thank you.
