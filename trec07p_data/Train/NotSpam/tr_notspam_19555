Make that 3 votes. I have both a doubletalk and a tripletalk. But lately, 
I've been using the doubletalk more than the  tripletalk. The tripletalk 
doesn't seem to work with the latest speakup-enabled version of the debian 
installer. The triple talk has some advantages over the doubletalk though. 
It  gets power through the USB port so you don't have to plug it into a wall 
socket. The doubletalk can use a battery but i would always forget to turn 
it off and the next thing I knew, the battery would be dead.

The tripletalk is also a little bit more solidly built. I had to send my 
doubletalk back to have the serial cable replaced. And now the headphone 
jack broke. It's true that the doubletalk has taken a beating the way i 
carry it around. I am always grabbing it and running up to somebody's office 
to fix their computer. But I do the same thing with the tripletalk and it 
still works.
