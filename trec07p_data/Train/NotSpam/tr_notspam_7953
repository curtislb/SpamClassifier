GCC's manpages are mechanically generated from its info files.  We
asked the FSF how to apply the GFDL and were told that the *entire
collection of manpages* counted as the Work, so it was okay to put the
Invariant Sections in separate manpages.  See
http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2001-11/msg00311.html et seq.

I'm not a fan of the GFDL, and I'm very happy to see Debian finally
throwing all of the FSF's documentation into non-free where it
belongs, but I don't think you need to worry about GFDL manpages being
undistributable (at least, as long as they come from FSF projects; one
could easily have a copyright holder not buy the above reasoning).
