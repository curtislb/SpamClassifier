2. COMING SOON: EJB 3.O PROJECTS 

In the next few weeks TopCoder plans to release a dozen or more EJB 3.0 entity bean projects directly to development, and we're giving you a heads-up!  We'll be looking to have collections of simple entity classes developed for use with a Java Persistence API (JPA) EntityManager, along with corresponding XML O/R mapping files.  If you haven't looked into JPA yet, then this might be a good opportunity to learn.  (And if you have experience with Hibernate then you will find yourself right at home -- it implements JPA.)

If you want to read up on EJB 3.0 entities and JPA then here are some resources:
* http://java.sun.com/javaee/technologies/persistence.jsp
* http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr220/index.html
* http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2006/05/17/standardizing-with-ejb3-java-persistence-api.html
* http://www.javabeat.net/javabeat/ejb3/articles/2007/04/introduction_to_java_persistence_api_jpa_ejb_3_0_1.php

If you want to experiment with EJB 3 persistence then there are many application servers you could use, but JBoss 4.0.5 might give you the best orientation to the upcoming components [hint].
