Unfortunately, you still cannot use Hershey fonts with plotmath (just
lacking implementation).

Also, the perpendicular symbol is not implemented in plotmath (yet).

In this case though, there may be a possible workaround.  Try the
following ...

> plot(1, ann=FALSE)
> title(ylab=expression(epsilon["\136"]), family="symbol")

The plain text character "\136" gets drawn using the symbol font and the
perpendicular symbol is character 94 (Octal 136) in the Adobe Symbol
Encoding and in the Windows symbol font encoding so this works for PDF,
on Windows, and on X11 (though I had to switch to a single-byte encoding
to get my system to pick up the symbol font).  The drawback with this
solution is that anything that is NOT a special mathematical symbol in
the expression will come out in Greek letters.
