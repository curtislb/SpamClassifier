There's nothing stoping CDs with content that you feel is free enough
being made. And frankly, being concerned with a PR image isn't a valid
reason to compromise principles. The FSF is no more interested in its
public image than Debian is. [If the FSF or Debian were, there's no
doubt that RMS, myself, and the rest of us who are non-photogenic
would have been hidden away long ago.]

I agree, which is why I've personally been involved in pressuring the
FSF to resolve the remaining issues in the GFDL for quite some time.
In my opinion, recognizing the issues and getting them resolved is the
right way forward; ignoring them because they come from the FSF is
not.

Deciding to use free software is quite often a moralistic stance;
where your convictions and morals lie dictate how you feel about this
issue.

If a developer is unable to accept the decision of the majority as the
decision of Debian on a particular issue, that's really all that they
can do. In the end, of course, the separation of works into main and
non-free is necessarily a judgement based on the licenses which the
works have. Anyone who disagrees with the final determination made has
the ability to decide that the packages in the archive have
incorrectly segregated, and filter the Packages.gz files in the
archive appropriately.

Regardless, in this particular case, the only way to effect the change
you are calling for is to have a GR to overturn the existing GR.
Discussion of the issue on this mailing list will not cause the GR to
disappear.
