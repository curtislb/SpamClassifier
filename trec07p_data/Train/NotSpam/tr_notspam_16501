I'll just answer a couple questions about the Levelstar Icon that I
know the answers to.  Larry may jump in and answer others. 

Yes you can run other applications on the Icon.  Most all of it's
current facilities are written in python but it comes with speakup and
you can drop into a console and run whatever you like.  It is using a
common embedded packaging system called open embedded.  The synth it
uses is via voice or FlexTalk so it is proprietary but somebody could
port espeak or something else to it if they liked.

The python code is compiled so it is also proprietary but there are
python decompilers available if somebody with the experience wanted to
take it apart to get the source.  I haven't had the time to devote to
it as much as I'd like to.
