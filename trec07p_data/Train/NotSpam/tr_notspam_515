Lou Dobbs Tonight
Tuesday, April 10, 2007

Tonight, the biggest battle in Baghdad in weeks for U.S. armed
forces. Violence in Iraq is rising sharply. We’ll have a
special report.

Nearly 100 products have been recalled in America by the
Consumer Product Safety Commission so far this year. More than
half of those recalls were manufactured in China. Many of them
were children’s clothing and toys. Why isn’t the United States
government doing anything to protect American citizens from
dangerous products? Who is watching out for the American
consumer? We’ll have a special report.

While it becomes more difficult for American families to send
their kids to college, new evidence suggests that financial aid
lenders and colleges are tied up in conflicts of interest and
backroom deals. New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo is
heading an investigation into student loan kickbacks.  Cuomo
found that Student Loan Xpress paid consulting fees and part of
graduate school for a student loan officer at John Hopkins
University. And the company allegedly also paid tens of
thousands of dollars to officials at two other colleges. We’ll
have a full report.

A large percentage of Americans including a majority of
Hispanic Americans believe law enforcement should crackdown on
illegal aliens. According to a recently conducted poll by Zogby
International and Judicial Watch, nearly 70 percent of likely
American voters, including more than 50 percent of Hispanic
Americans, support law enforcement efforts to stop illegal
aliens. The poll also found a large percentage of Americans in
favor of local law enforcement of federal immigration laws.
We’ll have that special report tonight.

We’ll continue our coverage of the most important espionage
case in a generation. Today, a naval investigator is expected
to take the stand in the latest development in the case of
American engineer Chi Mak who allegedly conspired to smuggle
American military secrets to Communist China. We’ll have a live
report from the courthouse.

And we'll be joined by three of the nation's best radio talk
show hosts: Joe Madison of WOL in Washington, Laura Flanders of
Air America in New York and Charles Goyette of KFNX in Phoenix.
We’ll continue our discussion of the controversy surrounding
comments by Don Imus with Clarence Page, Pulitzer prize-winning
columnist and member of the editorial board at the Chicago
Tribune, and Bryan Monroe, president of the National
Association of Black Journalists.
