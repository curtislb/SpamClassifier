A  message to  KTWARWIC@SPEEDY.UWATERLOO.CA from  the CNN-DAILYTOP10  was
returned as undeliverable. It eventually made it through to you since you
are reading this message, but there was a problem with the delivery.

After an e-mail is undeliverable, there  is the possibility that you will
be  removed  from that  list  automatically.  Please send  the  following
command in  the message  body to  LISTSERV@CNNIMAIL23.CNN.COM as  soon as
possible:

                         CONFIRM CNN-DAILYTOP10

This will tell LISTSERV that your account actually does work and that you
still want to receive mail from the CNN-DAILYTOP10 list.

Thank you.
