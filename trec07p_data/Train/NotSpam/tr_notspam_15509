  Hi everyone, <br>
  <br>
  <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>I</span></b>&#8217;ll be anchoring our
  broadcast tonight from <st1:City w:st=3D"on">Washington</st1:City>, <st1:=

attle
  for a single vote in Congress. We&#8217;ll show you my report tonight alo=
ng
  with the day&#8217;s news. <br>
  <br>
  First, Dr. Jack Kevorkian called his release from jail today &#8220;one of
  the high points in life.&#8221; Kevorkian, who has participated in at lea=
st
  130 assisted suicides, spent eight years in jail &#8211; and says he still
  believes people should have the right to die. <b><span style=3D'font-weig=
ht:

  exclusive <b><i><span style=3D'font-weight:bold;font-style:italic'>60 Min=

  interview with Kevorkian. <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Byron Pitts=
</span></b>
  will also report on how Kevorkian drew the country&#8217;s attention towa=
rd
  how we live the end of our lives. <br>
  <br>
  More of the story of Andrew Speaker, the <st1:City w:st=3D"on"><st1:place
   w:st=3D"on">Atlanta</st1:place></st1:City> attorney infected with potent=
ially
  deadly tuberculosis, unfolded today. He apologized to those he may have
  exposed. Tonight we&#8217;ll hear their reaction as some of them get resu=
lts
  of their TB tests. <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Kelly Cobiella</sp=
an></b>
  will have the very latest. <br>
  <br>
  And new violence erupted in a Palestinian refugee camp in <st1:country-re=
gion
  w:st=3D"on"><st1:place w:st=3D"on">Lebanon</st1:place></st1:country-regio=
n>,
  where militants allegedly linked to al Qaeda are holed up. The Lebanese a=

  effort by sending in ammunition for this deadly standoff, <b><span
  style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Mark Phillips</span></b> will report. <br>
  <br>
  Finally, <b><span style=3D'font-weight:bold'>Steve Hartman</span></b> wil=
l have
  a special <i><span style=3D'font-style:italic'>Assignment America</span><=
/i>
  tonight. He&#8217;ll give you a behind-the-scenes look at the sacred grou=
