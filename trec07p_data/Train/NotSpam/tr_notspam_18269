CBS NEWS STS-117 STATUS REPORT: 39
Posted: 3:39 PM, 6/11/07

By William Harwood
CBS News Space Analyst

Changes and additions:

   SR-36 (06/10/07): Flight director thrilled with smooth rendezvous; pitch=
 maneuver finds no obvious signs of damage to shuttle's heat shield
   SR-37 (06/10/07): Shannon leaning toward spacewalk repair of protruding =
blanket
   SR-38 (06/11/07): Astronauts gear up for spacewalk, solar array install
   SR-39 (06/11/07): S3/S4 bolted to station power truss

3:39 PM, 6/11/07, Update: S3/S4 bolted to station power truss; spacewalk on=
 tap=20

Running about an hour behind schedule, the Atlantis astronauts successfully=
 bolted a new 36,000-pound solar array truss and rotary joint to the intern=
ational space station today, setting the stage for a spacewalk by Jim Reill=
y and Danny Olivas to activate and outfit the new equipment.

Shuttle pilot Lee Archambault, operating the space station's Canadian-built=
 robot arm, eased the huge truss segment into place for an initial capture =
around 2:27 p.m. A large claw on the outboard end of the existing S1 truss =
then rotated and locked onto a capture bar in the S3 segment.

As the claw pulled the S3/S4 segments in tight, alignment guides ensured fo=
ur motorized bolts lined up properly. By 3:11 p.m., three of the bolts had =
been successfully driven home - a requirement for pressing ahead with today=
's spacewalk - and a few minutes later, Archambault, operating the robot ar=
m, released the now-firmly-attached truss. The fourth bolt was in place by =
3:38 p.m.

The work ran about an hour behind schedule after the space station's contro=
l moment gyroscopes became "saturated," losing their ability to maintain th=
e station's orientation. This is a routine issue with gyroscope systems and=
 after using the shuttle's thrusters to maintain control, the station gyros=
 were reset and able to resume control.

Reilly and Olivas are suited up in the station's Quest airlock module. Toda=
y's spacewalk originally was scheduled to begin at 2:58 p.m., but it was de=
layed, along with truss attachment, by the gyro problem. As of 3:34 p.m., t=
he crew was preparing to depressurizing the airlock, which would result in =
a spacewalk start time of around 4:10 p.m.
