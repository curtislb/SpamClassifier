They're in the /lib/firmware folder.  My problem was that when I 
un-tarred the ipw2200-fw file. it put ipw2200-fw in the /lib/firmware 
folder.  Inside of it were the sniffer and other files. In essence 
creating a sub-directory.  I needed to have only the files in 
/lib/firmware.  Does that make any sense?  If I browsed /lib/firmware, I 
saw ipw2200-fw[3.0, when I browsed it, it contained the individual files

My ipw firmware files are in /lib/firmware, where I think you said
yours were, and I am not having any problems with them.

Inquiring mind would like to know.
