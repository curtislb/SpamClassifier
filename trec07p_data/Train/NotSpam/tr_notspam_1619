As long as you still have some way to reach the low-level opens --
though it's an odd thing to do (except perhaps in a disk integrity
checker), there's no fundamental reason why you shouldn't be able to
actually look at the bytes that happen to represent a directory
structure on disk.

Also, for security or correctness reasons you may want to make sure that
you don't clobber things you don't mean to -- so non-dwimmy open
variants are a good idea to keep around.

This could be as simple as 'open(:!dwim)' I guess, or whatever the
negated boolean adverb syntax is these days ....
