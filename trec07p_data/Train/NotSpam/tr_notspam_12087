Hope to be able to have a pronounciation from Italy as well.
The MoH met during WHA, discussed a lot of possible partnerships on API and the so called
"health diplomacy" that the Italian minister likes so much.
Now it is a question of implementing it, as they did with the CLs.
I have been in contact with the Moh and MoFA for the last three days all the time.
I trust it is not too far....
Nicoletta

Issues related to Ip and medicines at a hotly debated topic here at the
World Health Assembly. Lets hope the UK will repeat the statement of support
here at the WHA. There is still a deafening silence on the side of the WHO
on the subject. Which sits not well with many of the developing country
member states.

This information comes from Steve Cockburn coordinator of the UK Stop AIDS
Campaign.
At a Westminster Hall debate yesterday, Gareth Thomas made the following
comment:


"hon. Friend also asked about our position on trade-related aspects of
intellectual property rights. We remain a strong supporter of the right of
developing countries, including Thailand and Brazil, to implement the TRIPS
agreement, as is appropriate for

15 May 2007 : Column 243WH
their circumstances. We understand the concerns of Médecins sans Frontières
and several others about the complexity of the agreement, which is why we
are working in Kenya and Botswana to fund legal research and assistance
that will help those countries to implement the flexibilities that are
available under the TRIPS process"


There is much more in quite an interesting statement - see
