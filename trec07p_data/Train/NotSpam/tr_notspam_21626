Lou Dobbs Tonight
Friday June 22, 2007

Tonight, a top U.S. General accuses Iran of escalating support
of Iraqi insurgents. We’ll have a full report.

A law firm’s video teaching employers how to get around hiring
Americans has outraged members of Congress. Senators Chuck
Grassley and Lamar Smith sent a letter to U.S. Labor Secretary
Elaine Chao saying the tape shows "the blatant disregard for
American workers and deliberate attempts to bring in cheaper
foreign workers through the H-1B program". We’ll have a full
report on the continued effort to skirt hiring American
workers.

The future of the Senate’s revived immigration bill may be
determined by the cloture vote expected on Tuesday. Senators
are already casting votes in the public forum saying they won’t
vote for cloture. Cloture would require 60 votes to bring the
bill to the Senate floor. We’ll have more on that tonight.

Are members of Congress looking to crack down on Talk Radio?
We’ll be investigating talk that Senators Hillary Clinton and
Barbara Boxer have had discussions to fix “far right extremist
radio” as Republican Senator Trent Lott says “talk radio is
running America and we have to deal with that problem”. Are
both sides of the aisle coming together to fight talk radio?
We’ll have full coverage.

In our weekly tribute to the men and women who serve this
nation in uniform, we bring you the story of twin brothers who
were deployed to Iraq together where they protected our troops
along the main supply route. They were both wounded during
their tour and will be awarded the Purple Heart. Their special
relationship as twin brothers got them through the hardest
times. We’ll have a special report tonight.

And, three of the country's best political analysts: Robert
Zimmerman, Democratic National Committeeman, Michael Goodwin,
Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for the New York Daily News
and James Taranto, editor of the Wall Street Journal's
OpinionJournal.com join Lou.
