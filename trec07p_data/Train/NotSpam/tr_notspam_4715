"Confronting Thailand's Theft of American Property on World IP Day"

Featured Panelists:
James Pinkerton, Columnist, Newsday
Jim DeLong, Special Counsel, Kamlet, Shepherd & Reichert, LLP
Scott LaGanga, Executive Director, Property Rights Alliance
Jerry Norris, Senior Fellow, Hudson Institute

Moderated By:

Ken Adelman , Executive Director, USA for Innovation

The new Thai military regime, which assumed power by coup last
September, has introduced direct government theft of American innovation
through its abrogation of the intellectual property of three drugs
produced by American and European companies. U.S. Trade Representative
noted that Thailand continues to suffer from "widespread commercial IPR
counterfeiting and piracy." This forum will serve as an opportunity to
educate the Congress on the consequences of the Thai government's
actions and to discuss whether USTR should elevate Thailand to the
Priority Watch List in its Special 301 Report.
