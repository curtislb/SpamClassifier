TONIGHT ON  <http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/eveningnews/main3420.shtml> TH=
E CBS EVENING NEWS

Here is an early preview of what we are planning for tonight's CBS EVENING =
NEWS from Anchor and Managing Editor, Katie Couric...=20

Hi everyone,=20

I'll be anchoring a special hour-long broadcast tonight from Blacksburg, Vi=
rginia, where earlier today a gunman opened fire multiple times at the Virg=
inia Tech University, resulting in the deadliest campus massacre in U.S. hi=
story. Our team of correspondents will bring you complete coverage.=20

We will start by telling you about the incidents that began unfolding at 7:=
15 this morning in one of the largest residence halls on the Virginia Tech =
campus and continued two hours later at Norris Hall, an engineering buildin=
g. By late morning, at least 33 on campus were dead. President Bush said he=
 was "horrified" by the news of the shooting, and expressed his sympathy fo=
r the victims and their families. Thalia Assuras will talk with some of the=
 students who survived the shooting and have more eyewitness accounts.=20

Daniel Sieberg, our Science and Technology Correspondent, will detail how t=
he university and the students who study there used Internet communications=
 to keep one another informed as the tragedy unfolded.=20

And in the wake of such a massacre, it is natural to ask "could this have b=
een prevented?" Hari Sreenivasan will report on the state of security on ca=
mpuses around the country.=20

In the meantime, residents of the Northeast are coping with the remnants of=
 a massive storm that hit over the weekend, bringing record rainfall and st=
rong winds. By Monday afternoon, much of the East Coast was still under wat=
er and hundreds of thousands of people were without electricity. Nancy Cord=
es will have the story.=20

The National Urban League is releasing a report tomorrow that will show tha=
t black men in America don't have many of the same privileges as other citi=
zens. We'll have the study's findings tonight.=20

I hope you'll join us. In the meantime, stay updated on news out of Virgini=
a by visiting CBSNews.com.=20

Thanks,=20

Here is a look at some of the stories we will be focusing on:=20

VIRGINIA TECH LATEST: On Monday, Virginia Tech was the scene of horrible ma=
ssacre. With at least 30 dead and close to 22 injured, it is the worst camp=
us shooting in United States history. Police say the gunman killed a victim=
 in a dorm, and then later opened fire in a classroom where most of the fat=
alities occurred. CBS News Security Correspondent Bob Orr will have the lat=
est on the gunman and what exactly happened at Virginia Tech.=20

LOU DOBBS ON SCHOOL VIOLENCE: Lou Dobbs will offer his take on school viole=
nce in his second weekly commentary.=20

HISTORY OF SCHOOL SHOOTINGS: School shootings are nothing new. In fact, bef=
ore the massacre at Virginia Tech, a shooting in 1966 was the most devastat=
ing in United States history. Now, we once again are forced to take a look =
at why such horrific violence is happening and has continued to happen for =
decades.=20

VIRGINIA TECH TRAUMA: Clinical psychologist and Early Show Contributor Robi=
n Goodman will join us to take a look at the trauma the students at Virgini=
a Tech will be experiencing. How can they begin the healing process? Also, =
we'll ask Dr. Goodman about the trauma the shooting may be causing your chi=
ldren at home. Should they watch the news with you? And is it good for them=
 to do so? We'll take a look.=20

IS YOUR CHILD SAFE?: EARLY SHOW National Correspondent Hattie Kaufman will =

stions you need to be sure to ask on any campus tour.=20
