This doesn't matter, it's still free. If you derive GPL software, you can't
violate the terms of the GPL license and yet that GPL software still
remains Free by the DFSG definition. Same with a renamed ion derivative, if
you derive from a renamed ion and violate its license, the renamed ion
remains Free.
