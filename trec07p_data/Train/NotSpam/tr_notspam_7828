Well, I for one would be interested if I had a T22.  I have 600E that runs
etch flawlessly except for the sound system and modem (which never work
under linux on any laptop in my experience) and some issues with the
PCMCIA and USB ports.  But if someone had a DVD that would solve any or
all of  those problems, I would be very keen:  I simply cannot afford a
couple of days per issue, which is what it usually takes even with a good
ADSL connection.
