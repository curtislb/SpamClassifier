Sounds like a combination of both.

If your mail server is set up to allow internal sites to pass through
with no checks, then you should be OK

If you mail server checks everything, white list your internal domain

If your mail server is not the culprit, check your email program and
white-list things there as well.

But the kicker is you first need to make sure your headers are properly
formatted.  Check the header of the email in your Junk/Spam folder and
see why it got put there in the first place.  With spam-assassin running
on your mail server, it should put the score in the header.

You have some digging to do to figure out why, but the first spot should
be local machine, then server, then mail message.  Bad formatted headers
will do more harm then good, so getting things correct there might help
with scores on the other end.

HTH,
Wolf
