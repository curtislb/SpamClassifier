Yes, iconv, but still only if you know the encoding of the source, see
my "beforehand".
See also `man iconv`.

Don't do that unless the contents of the file (that you open for
reading) are in utf8.

No, see again my "beforehand". A utf8 file (I assume you mean "Perl
utf8") is still just a stream of bytes.
