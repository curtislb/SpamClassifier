Well, I'm used to deal with the mozilla beast...

Yeah but the fact that the maintainer didn't care about getting it fixed
for more than one month (the bug has been reported on 2007-03-25) is not
encouraging.

Part of xulrunner.

Sure.

Nothing particular no. I'm pretty sure you will get the same issue if
you try to build trunk.

We *do* need the technology. We might not have resources to make it
work, though.

Definite yes to both a) and b)

xulrunner doesn't use gtk widgets (except for the toplevel window) even
if you build it with gtk support, it just try to emulate the theme.

It's hard to explain to someone which is not familiar with the Sugar UI
design but we will need a bunch of custom widgets to implement it. And
xulrunner does not provide those. Sure you could reimplement the
controls we need in xulrunner, and write xulrunner components to talk
with sugar presence service and...

The Sugar platform is pretty well defined at this point and we made the
conscious decision to *not* use xulrunner to build it a while ago.
Evolving two different platforms, one based on GNOME and one on
xulrunner would be a non sense.

Convergence between the GNOME platform and the mozilla.org one has been
discussed multiple times in the past. It would be awesome in principle
but it won't happen any time soon. The only practical approach is to use
embedding to bridge the two worlds.
