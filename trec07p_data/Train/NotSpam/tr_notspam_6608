This week's file of the week is:
src/object.c

As Allison says below, no patch is to small.
typo fixes, spelling fixes, documentation welcome, as well as code 
refactorings.

I'm going to try to describe the purpose of each of the functions to get 
things started.
Patch coming soon. :)

Kevin

12:50 < mdiep> What happened to the File of the Week?
...
12:52 < tewk> Lets pick one for this week.
12:52 < chromatic> Do you want to pick it, tewk?
12:56 < tewk> I can, but I would choose pretty arbitrarily, If there are 
no suggestions, I'll choose.
12:57 < chromatic> Be my guest.
12:57 < particle> can it be pdd15-related?
12:58 < particle> we still have some pdd15 impl work to do
12:58 < allison> src/objects.c?
12:58 < chromatic> Absolutely.
12:58 < tewk> Sounds good.
12:59 < tewk> I'll send out an email.
12:59 < allison> it's a hairy one
13:00 < allison> but really, even cleanups as small as typo fixes are a 
huge help
13:00 < allison> no fix is too small to be worth making :)
13:01 < mdiep> from the looks of it, comments explaining what each sub 
does would be a big help
13:03 < tewk> I'll take that one, explainations of each sub.
