Yes, it does (I've checked with a "pseudo-user" who receives
r-help in digests in MIME format). 
So you can indeed do the following.

In my limited experience, the main problem is the bad quality of
people'e e-mail software which does not properly work with
the (typically invisible) 'References:' and 'In-Reply-To:'
headers which mailman indeed does preserve in its MIME-digests.

    TH> As to (1), you will probably get several suggestions for
