Hello,
    This simply isn't working for me--I've killed Speakup on TTY7, after 
starting Gnome and Orca, but the speakup keypad review keys still say blank, 
and preempt Orca's review keys.  Could the fact I'm using a software 
synthesizer have something to do with this?  Is this a bug fixed in later 
Speakup versions?
Thanks,
Zack.
