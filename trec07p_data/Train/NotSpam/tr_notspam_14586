I don't know jack about flex, so I can't help you with a comparison, but

this is what the zero-width lookahead assertion means.  It say with
out moving where you are currently starting the match, make certain
you can match the following pattern.  If you want it to move where the
match starts then you have to include something that does not have
zero-width like this

#match groups of three characters followed by three characters: "123" and "456"
@store = $str =~ m/(\d\d\d)(?=\d\d\d)/g;
