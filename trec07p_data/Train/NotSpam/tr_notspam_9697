Yes, but only if your data is proper. Mind that any ASCII-character is a
UTF-8 character too (U+0000 .. U+007F).

Only if your data is proper. A file is just a string of bytes. If you
use the proper IO-layer while reading in the file, then you'll end up
with proper data (a string of characters, not of bytes) to work with.

A UTF-8 encoded file can't tell you that it is UTF-8 encoded. For
example a UTF-8 BOM at the start (as Windows Notepad uses) is not proof.
So you need to know beforehand.
