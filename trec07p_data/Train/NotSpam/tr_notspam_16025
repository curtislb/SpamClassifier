Well, when you hold people to different standards based on whether they
agree with you or not, you can pretty safely expect that you'll end up
with a pretty biassed group.

That's not my experience. From what I've seen, -legal mostly consists of
people who aren't particularly experienced in free software development or
professionally trained in any sort of legal analysis making unconditional
claims about whether particular clauses are good or bad (mostly the
latter) and how they'll be enforced.

Obviously (I hope), I don't consider you to be inexperienced in free
software development, but just in this thread you've made a reasonable
number of unconditional statements, including ones that're simply wrong.

I hope you can see why that can be frustrating, and why it can be more
annoying when it's done by people whose only "contribution" to free
software seems to be participating on -legal.

Well, the GFDL issues have been "going to be fixed" for some years now
too; which, afaics, means that leaving Debian's interests up to folks
on -legal (including yourself in this case) isn't very effective. Maybe
it's not possible to be more effective on this score -- I'm not involved
enough to say -- but I do know -legal could be a lot more effective in
other respect, if it wasn't so insular: ie, less unconditional about
what's "free" and less likely to inflate things that are regarded in
the rest of the free software community as a non-issue (or a feature!)
into a disaster wrt DFSG-freeness.

What contributors to -legal feel is irrelevant to the above -- things
go to a GR if, and only if, Debian Developers care sufficiently about it.

And I mean, I know what a GR is for, why are you telling me? It's still
not a *good solution* for deciding these things; it's a last resort,
and the only other options we currently have a "ftpmaster decides" and
"it's obvious to pretty much everybody".

When you're saying a license from the Free Software Foundation is
non-free, it's *very easy* to tell you're going against another section
of the free software community. We've done that with the Affero General
Public License, the GNU Free Documentation License, and there's been
the occassional attempt to do it with the GPLv2 even.

Likewise when you're declaring an approach at free licensing from a
major community isn't good enough -- whether that be the good ol' MPL,
OpenSolaris's CDDL, or the Plan9 license.

The official position of Debian is what we allow in main. Thinking of
it in any other way is counterproductive. There might be times when
our official position is contradictory or inconsistent or incoherent,
and we should work to fix that, certainly.

And, of course, we are. I wish I could say the same about posters on
debian-legal.

Had you paid more attention to it you might have been qualified to
comment on it in the authoritative tone you used anyway.

I really don't know how I can possibly explain this to you. It seems
pretty basic to me.=20

If you don't believe there's a rational and consistent basis for coming
up with the original decision, then any decisions you come up with will
be, according to your own statements, either counter to the rationale
for that decision, or irrational.

> It's not like I'm personally campaigning for the ability to make these

No, what you're doing is pretending you're already in a position to be
authoritative about those decisions when you're not. Which is actively
misleading.

That's mostly because -legal won't even say that the GPLv2 is DFSG-free,
except in so far as it's explicitly listed as being DFSG-free.

"-legal in general", was, however, wrong on that score.

Unfortunately, since "-legal in general" becomes an amorphous set of
individuals who reserve the right to hold whatever opinions they like
whenever questioned, there's little hope of -legal ever learning from
its mistakes.
