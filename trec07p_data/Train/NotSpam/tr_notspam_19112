Most likely the second line should look like this:

  @TablePreReq   = keys(%{$ConfigFile{InputDataFile}});

that is we expect the $ConfigFile{InputDataFile} to be a reference to 
a hash so we dereference it and then get the list of keys.

it looks to me like the first line also needs to be changed. I'd 
expect it to be

  read_config ('../config/legacyload.cfg', \%ConfigFile);

to pass a reference to the hash. Though it's hard to be sure since we 
do not know what module defined the read_config() function. It might 
be using prototypes to allow you to call it like you did, but it 
looks unlikely to me.
