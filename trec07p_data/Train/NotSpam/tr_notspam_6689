HEADLINES:
SUICIDE BOMBER STRIKES SHIITE FUNERAL; AT LEAST 22 DEAD
Today, a suicide bomber detonated his explosives vest among a group of Shiite mourners in the town of Khalis, north of Baghdad.  At least 22 are dead with 33 others hurt, an interior ministry official tells CNN.  The mourners were gathered in a tent when the attack happened, the official said.  Khalis is in Diyala province, which has recently been plagued by violence.  In other scenes of violence today, a mortar round struck al-Husseiniya, north of Baghdad, killing six civilians and wounding 13 others.  Five mortar rounds exploded in the Shiite enclave of Abu-Dsheer in Baghdad's Dora district, killing two and wounding 15.  And a parked car bomb in the al-Bayaa neighborhood killed at least three civilians and wounded nine others.

WOLFOWITZ BLASTS “SMEAR CAMPAIGN,” VOWS TO STAY ON AT WORLD BANK
Today, World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz said he followed an ethics committee's instructions by giving his girlfriend a hefty pay raise and promotion and accused critics of mounting a "smear campaign" against him.  Wolfowitz told a bank committee investigating the matter that he knew he faced a possible conflict of interest when he took his job and "strongly objected" to being involved in a decision involving Shaha Riza, a longtime World Bank employee. But he said he acted in good faith by seeking the advice of the bank's ethics committee, which he said recommended Riza's reassignment to the U.S. State Department with a $180,000 salary to offset the disruption to her career.  "I believe that the record is so clear that I acted in accordance with the guidance of the ethics committee, I can only conclude that the rush to judgment and the orchestrated leaks of false, misleading, incomplete and personal information about me and Ms. Riza are all part of a conscious campaign to !
 undermine my effectiveness as president and derail important programs of the bank to aid the poor, especially in Africa," Wolfowitz said in a prepared statement to the committee.  The goal of this smear campaign, I believe, is to create a self-fulfilling prophecy that I am an ineffective leader and must step down for that reason alone, even if the ethics charges are unwarranted."  He said the bank's ethics committee had reviewed the matter twice and found both times that it had been handled "appropriately."  "For the directors now to declare my actions to be improper and criticize me would be unjust and frankly hypocritical," he said. "Such a change of course would not survive public scrutiny."  Wolfowitz has apologized for the way Riza's transfer was handled, although he has insisted he tried to implement the advice given to him by the bank's ethics committee.  Wolfowitz served as deputy secretary of defense in the Bush administration and was one of the architects of the 2!
 003 invasion of Iraq.  Today President Bush, who nominated Wol!
 fowitz t
o the post, reaffirmed his confidence in the embattled bank president saying, "My position is that he ought to stay and he ought to be given a fair hearing."

5 PENNSYLVANIA CAMPUSES REMAIN CLOSED AFTER E-MAIL THREAT
Delaware County Community College's five campuses in Pennsylvania remain shut, four days after faculty members received an e-mail threatening violence, college officials said.  The sender wrote that he or she "would be getting some guns from a friend," said the school’s Vice President Kathleen Breslin, who tells CNN the e-mail said Exton and Downington campuses would be targeted today or tomorrow.  West Whiteland Township Police Chief Ralph Burton tells CNN the campuses were shut Thursday for an indefinite period, after the e-mail was received by four to six faculty members at the Exton campus in West Whiteland Township.  No suspect has been identified, he said.  In the one-paragraph missive sent from a Hotmail account, the writer mentions feeling stressed and unhappy, Burton said.  The 10,000 students who attend the Exton commuter campus were notified of the threat via e-mail, signs posted on campus and a message on the school Web site.

NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR CORZINE LEAVES HOSPITAL
Almost three weeks after he was almost killed in a car crash, today New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine left Cooper University Hospital saying, "I am a blessed human being."  The 60-year-old governor was pushed in a wheelchair by his two adult children.  "I understand that I set a very poor example for a lot of young people, and people in general," the governor said to a crowd of well-wishers gathered outside the hospital entrance.  "I hope the state will forgive me," he said in an apparent acknowledgment that he was not wearing a seatbelt on April 12 when the SUV, being driven at about 90 miles-per-hour by a state trooper, hit a guard rail.  "I will work really hard to set the right example to make a difference in people's lives," he said.  His voice breaking, he thanked his family, medical staff and rescuers for their work and support.  The crash on the Garden State Parkway broke his left thigh bone in two places and caused the femur to pierce through his skin. He also broke r!
 ibs on each side, his sternum, his collarbone, fractured a lower vertebra and suffered a deep facial cut.

MORE MONEY, MORE MONEY: MILLIONAIRE HOUSEHOLDS AT A RECORD
Another year, another record for the rich. The ranks of households with a net worth of $1 million grew 5-percent to an all-time high of 9.3 million, according to a report out today.  The report, by research firm TNS, covers the year through mid-2006; the value of primary residences was not included.  The number of millionaire households has increased in each of the past four years, with the biggest growth spurt occurring in 2004, when the number of high-net-worth households jumped 33 percent.  As was the case last year, four of the top 10 counties with the greatest number of millionaire households are in California. Combined, those four California counties boast 561,255 millionaire households.  Other states with counties that boast the highest number of millionaires across the country are Illinois, Arizona, Texas, New York, Florida and Washington. King County, Washington, bumped off Middlesex County, Massachusetts, to take 10th place this year.  The ranks of the wealthy with!
  even higher net worths than $1 million are also expanding. A recent survey by the Spectrem group found that the number of U.S. households with a net worth of $5 million or more, excluding primary residences, exceeded 1 million for the first time.
