1:29 PM, 6/13/07, Update: Array retraction halted for spacewalk; Russians t=
roubleshoot more computer problems=20

The Atlantis astronauts, working step-by-step with flight controllers, succ=
essfully retracted the 115-foot P6-2B solar array 7.5 45-inch mast bays tod=
ay, or about 28 feet, before standing down for the start of a planned space=
walk by astronauts Pat Forrester and Steve Swanson.

"We appreciate the hard work and we got a lot further than we anticipated,"=
 Steve Bowen radioed the crew from space station control in Houston.

Space station commander Fyodor Yurchikhin and flight engineer Oleg Kotov, m=
eanwhile, worked with engineers in Russian to recover from yet another comp=
uter crash in the Russian segment of the outpost. Computer glitches Tuesday=
 caused major problems, preventing the station from switching back to gyros=
cope control of its orientation as planned.

NASA engineers ultimately figured out a way to switch back to gyro control =
Tuesday night and there are no problems on that front today. But the Russia=
n computers are critical to space station operations. It's not yet clear wh=
at is causing the trouble or what might be needed to fix it. Troubleshootin=
g continues.

For the NASA flight control team, the morning was devoted to retraction of =
the P6-2B solar array.

At 6:47 a.m., ground controllers started the long-awaited retraction, pulli=
ng the central mast in one-half bay to release tension on the springs holdi=
ng the flexible blankets taut.

The astronauts then commanded the mast to retract one bay at a time, starti=
ng at 10:42 a.m., stopping between each cycle to give ground controllers ti=
me to assess the alignment of the blankets. Commands were sent to wiggle th=
e mast, rotating it back and forth like a pencil between thumb and forefing=
er, to provide enough motion to coax blanket grommets to slide along guidew=
ires as needed.

By 12:36 p.m., the mast had been retracted 7.5 bays, or about 28 feet. Comm=
ander Rick Sturckow and Jim Reilly noted several hung-up grommets and anoth=
er wiggle test was ordered.

"OK, Houston. It doesn't appear to me that that had the same effect it had =
last time," Sturckow reported. "There are several grommets that are not poi=
nting directly at me. They are either pointing up or down. ... Basically, o=
n the left blanket, the inner wire has got like the first, the second, the =
third, the fifth and maybe the sixth pointing down toward the blanket box a=
nd then on the left blanket outboard, the guidewires, there's a couple of g=
rommets pointing up, out of the box.

"But JR and I've been looking at it and thought we might try one more bay a=
nd if that doesn't look good then we might be good to do either another wig=
gle or to extend, whatever you like."

Flight controllers debated that approach but decided to stand down for the =
spacewalk.

"After even more discussion, we're going to stand down," Bowen said. "We're=
 starting to get concerned about potential billowing and the damage that ma=
y cause the panel. So we think we're in a good config for the EVA and we're=
 going to stand down here."

The P6-2B array's central mast is an open framework truss that assembles it=
self into cube-like bays when driven outward and collapses into a canister =
as it is retracted. The mast stretches some 115 feet and is made up of 30.5=
 open-framework bays when fully extended.

The array must be retracted 19 or 20 bays - 70 to 75 feet - to provide the =
clearance needed to begin rotating the newly installed S4 solar arrays on t=
he right side of the station's main power truss so they can track the sun a=
s required.
