    Peru's old treasures being looted
    <http://www.washingtontimes.com/entertainment/20070413-093813-8915r.htm>

By AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE
Published April 14, 2007

LIMA, Peru -- Smugglers are sapping Peru's ancient heritage as statues, 
gold finery and other treasures are stolen to meet orders on the 
Internet or be sold on the street, Peruvian and international 
authorities say.
    Peru is the country worst hit in the region by thefts of ancient 
objects -- far more than Bolivia and Mexico, two other nations with a 
heritage of pre-Colombian antiquities, Interpol official Eladio Zamudio 
says.
    The international police agency is investigating several cases of 
stolen art objects from Peru that have passed through the country's 
porous borders to end up in Europe, the United States and elsewhere in 
South America.
    The head of the National Culture Institute, Cecilia Bakula, has 
denounced "the organized gangs that are rampant not only in drugs but in 
stealing cultural heritage."
    In one symbolic case, police in March caught thieves trying to sell 
an old flag to an antiquarian in Lima. It was the same one the Peruvian 
leader Jose de San Martin had used when proclaiming independence from 
Spain in 1820.
    The western South American nation is rich in antiquities from before 
the Inca empire, which ruled much of the region for hundreds of years up 
to the 16th century, as well as artworks dating from the subsequent 
Spanish colonial times.
    Peru's soil yields numerous fossils and archaeological finds -- many 
of which are looted by so-called huaqeros, smugglers who swoop onto 
remote sites at night. This carries a five-year jail term, but looters 
often get away with a fine.
    Authorities say they lack the power and resources to fight back.
    "It's difficult to guard more than 10,000 archaeological sites," 
says Blanca Alva, the institute's official in charge of defending 
heritage. Among Peru's private museums, about 300 do not have their 
holdings inventoried, she adds.
    After looting, the first point of sale is often children hawking 
items on the street to tourists. These valuables have varied from 
antique fabrics to 6-inch-long teeth from a megalodon, a type of 
prehistoric shark.
    Orders for objects also come from the Internet, Interpol says. A 
museum near Lima removed from its displays a wooden statue of the 
mythological god Pachacamac, fearing it would be stolen after offers to 
buy it were made online.
    In remote parts of the Andes Mountains, Miss Alva says, colonial-era 
churches have been stripped of their finery. In the central Mantaro 
Valley, chapels are missing their altarpieces, pictures and other 
religious treasures.
    "Everything has been stolen, including the gold and silver 
chalices," Miss Alva says.
    The stolen goods are trafficked far afield. Interpol is tracking 
cases of items that have wound up in Belgium, France, Spain, Brazil, 
Uruguay and the United States.
    Several years ago, an altar weighing almost half a ton disappeared 
from the church of Challapampa in the south-eastern city of Puno and was 
smuggled across the Bolivian border. It wound up in a Texas art gallery 
but was returned when Peruvian authorities intervened.
    A golden headdress dating from at least as far back as the eighth 
century and valued at $1 million was recovered in London last year.
    Also last year, customs agents seized 114 envelopes containing the 
separated contents of a 397-page 16th-century manuscript stolen from 
Peru's national archives, according to John Alarcon Herrera, head of the 
postal customs authority.
    Other smugglers' tricks include painting over colonial-era pictures 
-- favorite canvases include works from the so-called Cuzco movement of 
religious painting.
    Antique pots, even while being smuggled, are sometimes used as 
containers for cocaine.

    Art thieves hit Chihuly exhibit

BY LISA ARTHUR
Call this one The Case of the Missing Red Reeds.

Red glass reeds, to be precise. Hand-blown sculptures designed by artist 
Dale Chihuly swiped on a dark and stormy night -- clich?d but true -- 
from Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden.

The theft happened sometime on the night of April 11, while a nasty 
storm pounded South Florida. The reeds were discovered missing the next 
morning, during the daily inventory of the thousands of pieces in the 
Chihuly exhibit.

Coral Gables police wouldn't comment Saturday, but Fairchild officials 
say they are hopeful about cracking the case and recovering the seven to 
12 stolen pieces, each valued in the ``tens of thousands of dollars.''

''We have some DNA evidence and a surveillance tape,'' said Bruce Greer, 
president of the Fairchild Board of Trustees.

He declined to elaborate, but did say the heist was definitely not an 
inside job. The tape ruled that out.

''The police asked me not to say anything else until we get the art 
back, and recovery is our focus,'' Greer said.

This is the second time reed-seeking thieves have hit the popular art 
exhibit. The first incident -- in December, shortly after Chihuly opened 
his second run at Fairchild -- ended happily with the stolen reeds 
recovered thanks to an anonymous tipster. There were no arrests; the 
investigation remains open.

The reeds aren't easily portable. The tubelike pieces stand six to seven 
feet tall, said Nannette Zapata, Fairchild's chief operating officer.

''Who knows what someone would do with them,'' she said. ``Enjoy them. 
Sell them. They are valuable pieces of art. They are worth tens of 
thousands of dollars each, at least. This is a major theft.''

Greer said the Chihuly exhibit will continue as scheduled and visitors 
won't notice that pieces are missing.

Chihuly couldn't be reached for comment, but his publicist Janet Makela 
sent the following statement by e-mail: ``We are aware of the incident 
and know that Fairchild has the situation well in hand. They are working 
closely with local authorities to recover the stolen artwork as quickly 
as possibly.''

The Seattle artist's six-month installation last winter and spring drew 
approximately 300,000 visitors. His rare return visit to Fairchild ends 
in May.

The thefts here aren't the first time Chihuly's art has been stolen, 
according to published reports.

In 2004, ''Moccasin Brown Desert Basket Set with Turquoise Blue Lip 
Wrap,'' valued at $50,000, was stolen from the Mockingbird Art Gallery 
in Bend, Ore. In 2003, a man walked out of an upscale Seattle hotel with 
a $40,000 glass bowl that was as big as a 36-inch television set.

In fact, according to a report in the Seattle Times, at least 25 Chihuly 
works are listed in the Art Loss Register, an international database 
used by police and art dealers to aid in finding stolen art.

Both Zapata and Greer said the Fairchild thieves twice beat a 
''sophisticated'' surveillance system that includes cameras and 24-hour 
guards. The thefts hurt the Garden deeply, they said.

''It's quite hurtful to do anything like this to a charity,'' said 
Greer. ``That someone would do this to a place that is a world-class 
institution and not want to protect a cultural treasure is something 
that I don't understand.''

Zapata encouraged people who know something about the theft to call the 
police or Fairchild with tips.

''When stuff like this takes place it doesn't make Miami seem like a 
wonderful place to display art,'' Zapata said. ``It really hurts more 
than people think.''

$26,000 piece of art likely became a puddle
The sculpture stolen from an Everett park may have fetched $100 for 
metal thieves.

/By David Chircop/
/Herald Writer
/

EVERETT - A bronze sculpture stolen from an Everett park last September 
would only bring about $100 if it was melted down and recycled.

But the theft of the 150-pound art piece wound up costing the city's 
insurance provider $26,000 to replace.

Sultan sculptor Kevin Pettelle believes metal thieves took his 
31/2-foot-tall piece, "Neck Fragment," which was stolen from Evergreen 
Arboretum and Gardens in Legion Park.

A city insurance policy paid Pettelle for the loss of the work, which 
the city had been leasing the statue for $500 a year.

"It's disheartening and I feel violated, especially if it's going for 
something as superficial as drugs," said Pettelle, whose work primarily 
focuses on the human body. "My guess is that it was taken for the bronze 
and that it's long gone."

"Neck Fragment" had been on display with permanent art pieces and 
sculptures on loan at the 2.4-acre arboretum since the summer of 2005.

Somebody knocked over the work and sawed the metal sculpture from its base.

When he first started sculpting 27 years ago, Pettelle said no one could 
have predicted that people would one day steal bronze sculptures to melt 
down for the metal. That was the sort of thing one might expect with 
sculptures made of more precious metals, such as silver.

But the times have changed.

His hunch that the bronze was recycled is based on a nationwide rash of 
metal thefts.

Prices for copper, the main ingredient of bronze, which is an alloy, 
have skyrocketed recently, a result of demand in China and other quickly 
developing countries. A consequence of that markup has been an increase 
in thefts.

Around the Puget Sound area, metal thieves have been particularly 
brazen, stealing 2,000 feet of power line that was downed in November's 
snowstorm. In February, Snohomish County PUD reported that more than 
half a mile of wire from streetlights on U.S. 2 near Index was stolen.

In March, thieves in Federal Way made off with a handmade 23-pound 
copper gong from Three Trees Yoga & Healing Arts Center, which members 
feared ended up in a scrap yard.

Other notable metal thefts in the news include brass flag holders, 
ripped from the graves of veterans in Pennsylvania and a brass church 
bell lifted from a heritage site in Quebec.

Like pawnbrokers, scrap metal dealers are required to record the 
identities of their suppliers. Not all operate above board, police say.

Authorities this week raided a south Seattle scrap yard, which police 
say was knowingly buying stolen metal items, including copper wire from 
utility companies.

The theft of the sculpture from Evergreen Arboretum and Gardens in 
Legion Park marks the first time anything was stolen from a public arts 
program, in which the city leases sculptures from local artists, Everett 
spokeswoman Kate Reardon said.

The four-year-old program, run by the city's municipal arts department, 
has a total of 17 sculptures downtown along Colby Avenue, and a handful 
at the Arboretum.

Later this year, it plans to develop a brochure to promote the downtown 
sculpture walk.

Reardon said city park rangers patrol the area where the sculpture was 
stolen, but can't always avoid determined thieves.

"We rely on the eyes and ears of people out there," she said.

Anyone with information about the sculpture is asked to call the Everett 
Police Department's tip line at 425-257-8450.

Reward for stolen Goldie's return

A reward of up to $20,000 is being offered for information on a rare 
Goldie painting stolen from Auckland University, but few believe the 
painting will be returned.

Planning Revenge by Charles Goldie was stolen from the university over 
the Christmas holidays. A set of poems by Colin McCahon and an Oxford 
lectern bible were also taken.

The Goldie had just been put on display on December 4, leading to 
suspicions it was stolen to order, said Detective Sergeant Kevin Burke. 
"There's a definite market for the items that have gone. But they're 
specialised items in that their appeal is probably limited, as opposed 
to just selling a colour TV or an X-Box down the pub."

The painting's London insurers have hired investigators GAB Robins to 
track the treasure - so far without success. The reward is a last 
effort, according to investigators, who say the chances of recovery are 
"very remote".

"I think it went underground very quickly. Because of what it is and how 
well known it is, [it] is unlikely to surface for a long, long time... 
It's probably gone to someone's private collection overseas [that we] in 
New Zealand will not hear about for a long time, at best," said an 
investigator.


But if information leads to the successful return of the painting, the 
reward could be up to $20,000.

"It depends on how good the information is - we don't have a specific 
sum," said the investigator.

The other two items are being investigated by Vero Insurance, which is 
not offering a reward at this stage.
