It's a lot clearer.

Yay!

I only noticed one thing (besides large swaths of removed code, which is 
always nice).  This code occurs multiple times:

+                /* if the :flat arg is empty, just go to the next arg */
+                if (!st->src.slurp_n) {
+                    st->src.mode &= ~CALL_STATE_FLATTEN;
+                    st->src.i++;
+                }

It's three lines; is it worth extracting somehow?
