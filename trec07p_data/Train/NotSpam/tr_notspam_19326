It's a valid aside to note that, while people know what singular and
plural are, few people use or even refer much to the Greek use of a
special intermediary (the dual) when there were exectly two of
something...but the basic mindest of dichotomy is a fundament of the
language. (c.f. the men/de construct so basic to the language).

Perl is like that. There are a lot of little corner cases that are
distinctly Perl, things unlikely to be seen elsewhere, and sometimes
hardly ever even used in Perl.... but the mindset that is Perl is a
beautiful thing, and that's still there. 

Besides, if you don't get the aesthetics of the Schwartzian Transform,
then you should probably be using python or java anyway, hm?

Let's let Perl be Perl. It's a new Perl, but it's still a pearl. =o)
