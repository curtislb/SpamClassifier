Are there any options I need to set in Lynx to be able to read web pages?
I ask because when I have used Orca and Speakup to navigate web pages
using Lynx, the help screen seems to get in the way and using the
standard arrow keys to navigate pages, it doesn't seem to track
properly for example I might read text and a few lines down I might
get the same text repeated.
What I am trying to say is that it doesn't scroll standard text like
it does in say a Word Processed document.
Am I supposed to use the read line keys in either Orca or Speakup to
navigate pages properly or is there an option I need to set?
I looked for one but the only ones I could find are the show cursor
option and the option for showing links as numbers but I am not sure
if it is one or both of these or whether it is something else which
seems obscure.
