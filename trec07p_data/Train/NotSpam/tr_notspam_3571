Is it still the "out of memory" panic?  

Just to add a "me too", I've also noticed that running PGE-based
routines with GC enabled causes them to consume memory much faster
than with GC disabled, which seems totally counterintuitive.

AFAIK, PGE isn't creating any global references (beyond its
static internal tables) that would cause objects to stick 
around "forever".  It certainly isn't part of PGE's design
for that to happen.  So, maybe we need to do a bit of forensics 
to find out where the memory consumption is occurring.
