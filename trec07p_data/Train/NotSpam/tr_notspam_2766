a bit of background.
Last week i emailed debian-desktop list to propose as lenny release goal
to add a task called "enterprise-desktop" and also one called
"enterprise-server", names are not important. I am just giving my
support to this.

I think the majoraty of debian's instalations are in corportive
environments, server And/or desktops. So i think that debian should have
the goal to give those users a better solution than the general one.

My first proposal was to create 2 tasks in tasksel. We have desktop
task, so we could add an enterprise-desktop task.

My point was to provide centralized authentication and information,
having something like libpam-ldap and libpam-mount installed and
configured by debconf's interface.

For -ldap is easy, just now, it just asks for the server, but -mount
would mount server partitions as well as user's desktop preferences.

Also, it would be given care to the tools and packages included.

A cdd would be good for some first testing, but having it included in
debian would be great.

count with me.
