I've appealed several times on this list for help to improve speakup 
support in Ubuntu, including server CD support. It's generated a bit of 
debate, but no real contributions have been made towards that from the 
speakup list.

That is a shame because this is probably the largest community anywhere 
of technically skilled visually impaired Linux users. The list is 
potentially a huge resource for helping less technical users have a 
better computing experience.

We have certain procedures for taking projects forward, which include 
writing a spec and then finding people to do coding. When there are 
useful code contributions from the community our dev team is happy to 
help accommodate and integrate that work. The same is true for the 
mainline kernel process.

I am told that at the moment we have about 20 modules that are not in 
the main kernel trees. This is generally to support new hardware or 
features that will eventually find their way into the main kernel. That 
way we don't have to indefinitely maintain external patches. We 
generally don't maintain patches perpetually that are not on track to 
move into mainline.

Ubuntu offered a channel by which the speakup module into the mainline 
kernel. But that requires a close collaboration with upstream (speakup) 
to help strengthen the code. Version control is also an issue; has 
speakup moved to git yet?

For gutsy we are seeking to  actively reduce the number of external 
modules and alternative configurations in the stock kernels. We will be 
preparing a few secondary kernels for special uses such as real-time. In 
each case there is an active community that uses those features who 
supports it.

The fact that Gnome or X can crash is a problem for most people, not 
just the visually impaired. The average user who is faces with the 
command line will generally do a fresh install to fix it (possibly of 
Windows). The point is that the real answer is to make Gnome and X 
unbreakable, which we are working on.
