Lou Dobbs Tonight
Wednesday, April 11, 2007

Tonight, Defense Secretary Robert Gates says that all
active-duty Army soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan will have to
serve three months longer than the usual standard. How are
members of the Armed Forces and their families reacting to the
news? We’ll have the latest for you tonight.

A large percentage of Americans, including a majority of
Hispanic Americans, believe law enforcement should crackdown on
illegal aliens. In fact, 66 percent of likely American voters,
including 51.6 percent of Hispanic Americans, support law
enforcement efforts to stop illegal aliens. So is the federal
government failing its citizens?

A group of immigration activists from groups who receive money
from the government are printing and distributing materials to
illegal aliens to help them avoid arrest and deportation. In
Los Angeles, the Catholic Church is finishing the construction
of a building attached to a church to shield illegal aliens
from the law. These efforts are all connected as part of an
effort to give aid and to harbor illegal aliens…an act that
appears to be in direct violation of the law. We’ll have that
story tonight.

More and more Americans are complaining that their bosses don’t
respect religious freedom: Complaints of religious intolerance
are on the rise in offices across the country. But how many are
legitimate? We'll explore why workers are demanding special
treatment from their employers based on their religious
beliefs.

And we'll be joined by Robert MacNeil, host of “America at a
Crossroads.” The PBS series explores the challenges confronting
the post-9/11 world and is aimed at creating a national
dialogue surrounding those critical issues. It debuts this
Sunday at 9 p.m. ET.

tonight’s show.

Lou Dobbs lays out his manifesto to save the middle class in
his new book, “War on the Middle Class: How the Government, Big
Business, and Special Interest Groups Are Waging War on the
American Dream and How to Fight Back.” War on the Middle Class
is now on sale in bookstores near you and on Amazon.com and
BarnesandNoble.com.
