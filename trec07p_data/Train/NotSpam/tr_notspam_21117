Hello Mark,

thank you for your additional advices.
I had already a short look at the vegan package but I think I have to=20=20
look closer and also at the ade4 package.

Unfortunately I am basically from Germany and my French is perhaps=20=20
only a rudimental school french but anyway, I would like to have a=20=20
look at this lecture notes, but I can not open the link you wrote me.
Ah sorry now the link works.

Greetings and thanks a lot.

Birgit

Hey Gavin,
I found it funny that your institute is in the Gower Street.
