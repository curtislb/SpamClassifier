I received this notice today from the Global Health Council. Hope that
some of you in the DC area can attend and raise the issues of access to
and pricing of cancer drugs, topics rarely addressed by the major cancer
societies whether or  healthcare professionals or of patients.   Note
sponsor of this event is Novartis.

2007 Conference on Global Health
<http://ent.groundspring.org/EmailNow/pub.php?module=URLTracker&cmd=track&j=141796589&u=1357988>

May 14, 2007

Auxiliary Event @ Conference

Transferring Knowledge into Action: Expanding Cancer Prevention,
Treatment and Care in Developing Countries

Tuesday, May 29, 2007
7-9:30pm
Educational Roundtable and Dinner
Diplomat Ballroom
Omni Shoreham Hotel
Washington, D.C.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The next urgent issue being recognized by the World Health Organization,
the International Agency for Research on Cancer, and a recent study in
the journal Annals of Oncology tells us that...

...12.5% of all deaths in developing countries are caused by cancer;
more than the total percentage of deaths caused by HIV/AIDS,
tuberculosis and malaria put together.

... up to 75% cancer patients in developing countries are diagnosed with
advanced stage or terminal cancers at the time they present to the
health system.

...more than 70 percent of the world's 7.6 million cancer deaths in 2005
occurred in low- and middle-income countries, where cancer rates are
also rising steeply.

This emerging cancer epidemic requires a coordinated global response.
But how?

This session will present comprehensive information and perspectives on
the topic of cancer in developing countries, and strategies will be
discussed for bringing cancer onto the global health agenda. Innovative
and thought-provoking ideas will focus on the mobilization of both
action and funding to address the challenges to cancer prevention,
diagnosis, treatment and care in developing countries.

Speakers:

Princess Nikky Onyeri
Princess Nikky Breast Cancer Foundation Nigeria;

Adamos Adamou
Member of the European Parliament and Head of the European Society of
Medical Oncology Developing Countries Task Force;

Allen Lichter
Executive VP and CEO of the American Society of Clinical Oncology;

Maurice Middleberg
VP for Public Policy, Global Health Council;

Joseph Saba
CEO of Axios
