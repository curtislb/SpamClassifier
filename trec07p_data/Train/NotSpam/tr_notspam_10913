Subject: YARQ: Yet Another Regex Question
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

I have a trouble ticket application that uses a regex to find a piece of
information in an incoming email and auto populate a field if it is found.  The
line it will be looking for is
CUSTOMER ENVIRONMENT customer_name
where customer_name will never have a space making it one word.  If I just want
to pull from the line the customer_name would my regex look like
$MatchString = "CUSTOMER ENVIRONMENT\s+(\w)"

For what it's worth the line that will handle this is
$found = ($Transaction->Attachments->First->Content =~ /$MatchString/m);
I'm guessing that when used in an assignment like this, $1 will be used as the
value.  The contents of (\w) in this case.  Is that correct?

Mathew
