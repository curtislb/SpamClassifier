I know they contain cross-references to the other man pages, I'm not
sure how clear they make it that the entire collection is the work.
Joseph Myers is the person to ask; I've cc:ed him.

I have no idea.  We took the FSF's licensing compliance guy's word for
it.  I suppose it might not be a bad idea to copy some of the text at
the URL above into debian/copyright.

I entirely agree with you, but the GCC steering committee is of the
opinion that there is no chance of persuading RMS to sign off on it.
[I do not know whether they ever tried, but I think they're right.
Joseph, again, might know more.]
