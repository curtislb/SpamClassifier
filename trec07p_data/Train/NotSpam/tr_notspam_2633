CBS NEWS STS-117 STATUS REPORT: 10
Posted: 09:00 p.m. EDT, 04/17/07

By William Harwood
CBS News Space Analyst

Changes and additions:

   SR-07 (04/05/07): NASA managers order shuttle propulsion system inspecti=
ons
   SR-08 (04/10/07): NASA hopes to launch Atlantis, with repaired fuel tank=
, around June 8
   SR-09 (04/17/07): NASA updates shuttle manifest
   SR-10 (04/17/07): NASA managers reassess Williams' status, mission durat=
ion

09:00 p.m., 04/17/07, Update: NASA managers reassess Williams' status=20

NASA managers are reassessing whether to leave astronaut Sunita Williams ab=
oard the international space station until August, a longer-than-planned st=
ay because of a shuttle launch delay, or to bring her home aboard the Atlan=
tis when flights resume in June, sources say.
`
Williams was launched to the station aboard the shuttle Discovery in Decemb=
er. She originally planned to return to Earth aboard the shuttle Endeavour =
in June, after the flight of Atlantis in March. But Atlantis was grounded b=
y hail damage to the ship's external tank and the March launch has been del=
ayed to no earlier than June 8. As a result, Endeavour's launch has slipped=
 to Aug. 9 and along with it, Williams' ride home.

Bill Gerstenmaier, NASA's chief of spaceflight operations, said during a ne=
ws conference April 10 that barring major problems, Williams would come hom=
e in August aboard Endeavour as planned. He said the impact of additional e=
xposure to space radiation was minimal.

Sources, however, said Tuesday NASA is revisiting the issue but a timetable=
 for making a final decision was not known.

For her part, Williams said during an earlier interview she was not overly =
concerned about increased exposure to space radiation or any other aspects =
of a longer-than-planned stay in space.

"Well, you know, I've been in constant contact with my flight surgeon and h=
e's keeping me up to date on the concerns we have," she told reporters duri=
ng a news conference April 10. "I think eight months is fine from all the i=
ndications I've heard, we're at a time right now where we're not getting to=
o much extra radiation from activity on the sun. So I think right now, all =
indications say that's no problem."

During an interview Monday evening, she was asked again whether she might c=
ome home early.

"I think, actually, the jury is out on that," she said. "I think they are d=
ebating this week when to bring me home - on the next shuttle or the shuttl=
e after that. So it is up in the air. That's just par for the course. I hav=
e a Navy background and been on deployments that have been extended and sho=
rtened. It's no big deal."

Whatever happens, she said, "I'm happy to stay, I'm happy to go home early =
and get Clay Anderson up here so that he can enjoy his time up in space. We=
'll just have to see what happens."

Anderson is scheduled to launch aboard Endeavour in August to replace Willi=
ams. If a decision is made to bring her home aboard Atlantis in June, Ander=
son presumbably would be added to that crew and launched ahead of schedule.=
 The impact of such a change on crew training, the sequence of spacewalks a=
board the space station and whether NASA would add an astronaut to Endeavou=
r's crew to replace Anderson is not yet known.
