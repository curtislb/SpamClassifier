						Today's Quote for the Day:
<br>

<br>
"He was thrilled when I told him he had come ahead of Brad Pitt and George =
Clooney in a survey of the world's most attractive men. He was less than th=
rilled when I told him the list was in alphabetical order" - Sarah, wife of=
 Zombie Brown, the Prime Minister in waiting.

In tonight's programme:
<br>

<br>
<b>Salman Rushdie</b>
<br>

<br>
The government of Pakistan has demanded that Britain withdraw the honour of=
 a knighthood awarded to Salman Rushdie.=20
<br>

<br>
In the heated atmosphere the knighthood has caused, Pakistan's religious af=
fairs minister appears to use the award as a justification for suicide bomb=
ing.=20
<br>

<br>
<b>David Cameron and the Battle for Britain</b>
<br>

<br>
The Conservative leader has made a speech rallying his troops against what =
he sees as the "old" politics of Zombie Brown.=20
<br>

<br>
We'll be hearing from a senior member of the Shadow Cabinet about whether t=
his is an attempt by Mr Cameron to get back on track after a very shaky cou=
ple of weeks.

<br>
<b>Israel and the Palestinians </b>
<br>

<br>
The schism between Gaza and the West Bank leaves Israel with the unpalatabl=
e possibility of a kind of "three state" solution" - two hostile Palestinia=
n entities on its borders.=20
<br>

<br>
With Prime Minister Olmert visiting the United States, we'll hear from a to=
p Israeli about what the Olmert government sees as the next move on Gaza.
<br>

<br>
<b>Bernard Manning </b>
<br>

<br>
The comedian Bernard Manning died today. Steve Smith will be assessing what=
 he did for British comedy.
<br>

<br>
<b>And finally...</b>
<br>

<br>
Newsnight viewer Dick Carbutt sent in the following joke which is - probabl=
y - fit for an 11 year old.
<br>

<br>
I went to the Patent Office trying to register some of my inventions.
<br>

<br>
I went to the main desk to sign in and the lady at the desk had a form=20
<br>
that had to be filled out.
<br>

<br>
She wrote down my personal info and then asked me what I had invented.
<br>

<br>
I said, "A folding bottle."
<br>

<br>
She said, "Okay. What do you call it?"
<br>

<br>
"A Fottle."
<br>

<br>
"What else do you have?"
<br>

<br>
"A folding carton."
<br>

<br>
"What do you call it?"
<br>

<br>
"A Farton."
<br>

<br>
She sniggered and said, "Those are silly names for products and one of=20
<br>
them sounds kind of crude."
<br>

<br>
I was so upset by her comment that I grabbed the form and left the office
<br>
without even telling her about my folding bucket.=20
