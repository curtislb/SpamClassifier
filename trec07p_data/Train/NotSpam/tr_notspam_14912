Yeah, a few weeks ago I forgot my doubletalk synth at work when I went home 
for the weekend. I had an install that just couldn't wait so i did a serial 
console install. It wasn't easy but it worked. Although, if I wasn't already 
very familiar with the installer, I'm not sure I'd have been able to pull it 
off.
