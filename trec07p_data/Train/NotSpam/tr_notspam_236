HEADLINES:
PRES. BUSH RE-LAUNCHES PUSH FOR IMMIGRATION OVERHAUL WITH ARIZONA VISIT
President Bush renewed his push for an overhaul of U.S. immigration laws today, telling Border Patrol agents and National Guard troops that a border clampdown must be accompanied by opportunities for immigrant workers.  "All elements of the issue must be addressed together," the president said. "You can't address just one aspect and not be able to say to the American people that we're securing our borders. We need a comprehensive bill, and that's what I'm working with members of Congress on."  Mister Bush's effort to create a temporary guest-worker program and a path to legal status for an estimated 11 million-plus illegal immigrants foundered in a Congress controlled by his fellow Republicans last year. Many of his GOP allies opposed the legalization plan in particular, denouncing it as "amnesty."  But President Bush called his plan "a practical answer that lies between granting automatic citizenship to every illegal immigrant and deporting every illegal immigrant." He said!
  the proposal did not amount to amnesty, since workers now in the country illegally would pay back taxes and a "meaningful penalty" for breaking the law.  Mister Bush also said any "comprehensive" bill should include tight border controls, a crackdown on workers who hire illegal immigrants and efforts to help new immigrants learn English and civics.  The Senate passed an immigration bill along the lines of Bush's proposals last year. But it was never reconciled with a bill backed by GOP critics in the House of Representatives, which limited its measure to border enforcement.

THOUSANDS GATHER IN NAJAF FOR ANTI-AMERICAN RALLY ON MAJOR ANNIVERSARY
As thousands of Shiite protesters gathered today in the holy city of Najaf for an anti-American demonstration called for by radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, a U.S. military spokesman voiced approval, saying the U.S. military came to Iraq to give Iraqis the freedom to protest.  U.S. military spokesman Major General William Caldwell tells CNN, "There's about 5,000 to 7,000 of them today out there, and as we watch that, it's going peacefully. They're expressing their will. I mean, that's something we came here to give them the ability to do. Four years ago it was not possible. Today it is.”  Najaf Police spokesman Colonel Ali Nomas tells CNN that tens of thousands of protesters have gathered in Najaf.  He said extra Iraqi security forces were deployed throughout the city, but there were no initial reports of violence.  U.S. military spokesman Colonel Steve Boylan estimated the crowd size at about 5,000 to 7,000, based on aerial photographs.  Meanwhile, today is the fourth!
  anniversary of the fall of the Iraqi capital to U.S. forces.

IRAN: WE'VE REACHED “INDUSTRIAL LEVEL” NUCLEAR PRODUCTION
Iran's nuclear production has reached the "industrial level," the nation's hard-line controversial president announced today.  "Iran has succeeded in development to attain production at an industrial level," President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said in a speech at the Natanz uranium enrichment facility in central Iran, on the anniversary of the start of uranium enrichment at the plant.  "With great pride, I announce that as of today, our dear country, Iran, is among the countries of the world that produces the industrial level of nuclear fuel."  He vowed it will be used for energy, "and for the expansion of peace and stability," adding that the goal of "progress" for Iran is "irreversible."  Ahmadinejad's speech came on what Iran is calling its National Nuclear Feast, designed to send a message to the world that Iran will not halt its nuclear activities despite calls by many western nations, particularly the United States, and sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council.  Bells !
 rung at schools throughout the country, and the kids chanted slogans such as "Nuclear energy is an inalienable right of the Iranian nation," "No country has the right to deprive Iran of its indisputable right," and "The Iranian nation is in need of nuclear fuel cycle," state-run news agency IRNA said.  The Bush administration believes Iran is using its nuclear energy program to develop nuclear weapons.  The International Atomic Energy Agency -- the U.N. nuclear watchdog -- has said it cannot confirm that Iran's nuclear activities are really for peaceful purposes.  IAEA officials say Iran has failed to cooperate with inspectors.  Ahmadinejad said today there has been "no evidence of violation in our activities."

NEW YORK MOVES ITS PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY TO FEBRUARY 5
Today, New York Governor Eliot Spitzer signed a law officially moving his state's presidential primary to Feb. 5, 2008, joining an ever-growing roster of states to hold a presidential contest that day.  February 5 is quickly shaping up to be essentially a "national primary," with 10 other states having already scheduled presidential primudles or caucuses that day and another 15 states considering doing the same. It will be the largest single day of voting next year aside from the general election itself in November.  The Empire State is one of the largest prizes in each major party's nomination process. The largest prize, California, officially moved its primary to Feb. 5 last month.

GAS PRICES ON THE RISE.  UP MORE THAN 18-CENTS IN PAST 2 WEEKS: SURVEY
Gas prices rose more than 18-cents over the past two weeks, to a national average of $2.79 per gallon of self-serve regular, a national survey says.  That marks a rise of 60 cents since late January, said Trilby Lundberg, publisher of "Lundberg Survey," which tallies prices every two to three weeks at 5,000 gas stations.  The current price is about 12 cents higher than it was a year ago, and 24 cents lower than the record high set last August, she said.  Lundberg attributed the price increases to problems at several refineries that cut gasoline production at a time of rising demand.  Lundberg said OPEC's million-barrel-per-day cut in production is also helping keep crude prices strong.
