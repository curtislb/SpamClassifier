I understand that. And this is perfectly reasonable. However, you  
*could* do step 2 also in response to a dbus message. In fact, a few  
days ago the Sugar code handled both cases nicely. Now you replaced  
that mechanism by an admittedly better one, but at the same time you  
have removed all fallbacks - and that's what I'm arguing about.

Unless you have an activity which cannot set the window properties  
before opening the window.

Agreed, but it would help activity developers like me if you  
supported alternate strategies.

You misunderstood. This would only be the backup-strategy. What I  
suggest is allowing multiple ways to detect activities. There is the  
one preferred way of X window properties, but there could be a DBus- 
based one, too.
