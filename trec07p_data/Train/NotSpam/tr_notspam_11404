Intellectual Property Management in Health and
Agricultural Innovation: A Handbook of Best
Practices has been released earlier last week at
BIO in Boston. Prepared by and for policy-makers,
leaders of public sector research establishments,
technology transfer professionals, licensing
executives, and scientists, the Handbook offers
up-to-date information and strategies for
utilizing the power of both intellectual property
and the public domain. Eschewing ideological
debates and general proclamations, the authors
always keep their eye on the practical side of IP
management. The Handbook provides substantive
discussions and analyses of the opportunities
awaiting anyone in the field who wants to put intellectual property to work.

The Handbook is a suite of 157 chapters and
prefatory comments, composed by nearly 200
authors from East, West, North and South. The
companion Executive Guide distills the key points
of each chapter into simple language and places
them in the context of evolving best practices.
The books will be distributed for free to low-
and middle-income countries (subject to
availability of funding and support for distribution).

Please visit www.ipHandbook.org to order online,
or use the order form below.  Distributed for
free to developing countries (subject to
availability of distribution support and funding).

----------
“This Handbook... is a valuable guide in helping
to navigate the complex­ but rewarding­world of
an increasingly global innovation system.”
­ Norman Borlaug, Nobel Peace Prize Laureate

“At the dawn of the 21st century the world
created an unprecedented wave of public–private
partnerships. For such investments to bear fruit
as public goods it is paramount to manage
intellectual property with the public interest in
mind. This Handbook provides expert guidance to
do just that and will assist in developing new
capabilities in low- and middle-income countries.”
­ Ariel Pablos-Méndez, Managing Director, Rockefeller Foundation

“For all who believe, as I believe, that
developing countries can­and should­participate
in and benefit from an interconnected world of
innovation, this book is an indispensable guide.”
­ Mahmoud F. Fathalla, Professor and former Dean,
Medical School at Assiut University, Egypt, and
Chairperson of the WHO Advisory Committee on Health Research

“Intellectual property (IP) has become a much
richer field of endeavor as it has moved from
isolationism in the world of policy to a position
of engagement. [This Handbook] will serve as an
invaluable resource in this challenging new environment.”
–– From the Foreword of Francis Gurry, Deputy Director General, WIPO

“This Handbook­which really transcends the
category of handbooks altogether­ is a must read
for anyone who deals with intellectual property.”
­ Pramilla Senanayake, FRCOG, Chair, Global Forum
for Health Research, MIHR, and the Concept Foundation
