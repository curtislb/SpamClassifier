But it's a XUL application right? Not an embedding application.

We are locked into gtk widgets, yeah. So I think there are two
possibilities:

1 Write an embedding widget from scratch in Pyxpcom. It has been done
for JavaXPCOM I think, so it's possible in theory.

2 Use gtkmozembed (written in C) but give access to the gtkmozembed
nsIWebBrowser as a PyXPCOM object so that we can access the DOM document
from python. It should be possible but I never investigated it much.

Does this clarify?

Thanks,
Marco
