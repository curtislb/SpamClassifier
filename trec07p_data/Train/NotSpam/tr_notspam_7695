Hello everyone,
I was wondering, is there a Live CD version of Fedora?
I have tried Ubuntu on 4 of my computers, 3 of which are laptops, and so 
far, no sound on the 2 newer systems, and it does not seem to even boot on 
the 2 older units, one is a gateway desktop, and the other is a Presario 
1800 laptop.
Maybe even if there is a Fedora Live version, maybe there is no software 
speech anyway.
Any sure-fire distros available which I could try?
Thanks
Glenn
