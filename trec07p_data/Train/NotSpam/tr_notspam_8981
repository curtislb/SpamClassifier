Using InactiveDestroy flag seems a standard way since this module's author provide this flag.
But it's maybe bring some problems when the applications are large enough,and it's not the fact that every programmer would disconnect their dbh connections in time.For example,consider the case programs were run under modperl and without Apache::DBI,using this flag would possibly make lots of db connections to database and consume db's socket source quickly.
Then for me I would maybe consider another way of creating its own dbh in child after fork.
Hope I'm right,:)
