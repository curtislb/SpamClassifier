Just see EC Regulation 44/2001:
"A judgment given in a Member State is to be recognised automatically, no
special proceedings being necessary unless recognition is actually
contested. A declaration that a foreign judgment is enforceable is to be
issued after purely formal checks of the documents supplied."
http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/l33054.htm

Most relevant is article 5(1) that says that "in matters relating to a
contract, [jurisdiction is] in the courts for the place of performance of
the obligation in question". If I'm in the Netherlands and distribute
CDDL software to a Belgian citizen while violating the CDDL, the
copyright holder has to come to the Netherlands, choice-of-venue
(mostly) notwithstanding.
