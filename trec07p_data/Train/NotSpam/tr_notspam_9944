I am writing up that proposal, and a far more extensive patch. I do
not mind the revert, I had asked for review in the RT.

I really hope this does not sound whiny but review has been a problem
for me. This is not the first revert for a lack of review. Could someone
who is trusted please designate themselves as a reviewer for this particular
issue ?

The loader is not "hot" like the object implementation and alot of other
important issues being worked on, but it is important. Gentoo's parrot
in tree is 0.4.6. The maintainer has (by rumor) thrown up his hands
on parrot.

Parrot deserves better than being thrown to the side for a broken
install target, and an alpha loader.

The issues are not gentoo specific either. The ebuild that I posted
for gentoo was almost a dead-on match for the RPM posted, and we
didn't talk to each other at all before posting.

I will keep working on the patches because they are necessary.
Please though when I finish the proposal please think on it.

-> think about how the changes will affect you.
-> think about how other languages have worked well (I nominate perl5)
-> think about how other languages have been bad or annoying (I nominate ja=
va)

then library.c can go back to collecting dust and I can do something more
fun like pheme and async IO.

Cheers,
Mike Mattie
