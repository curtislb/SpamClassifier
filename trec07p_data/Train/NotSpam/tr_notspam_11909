Amanda,

This sounds like a PCI error of some sort, it appears to probe
the PCI bus and and cannot find the card. The message shows
it assigned an interrupt (IRQ 9) but then says cannot find the 
slot  for index 0 (range 0-0), that could also be related to the 
ACPI which among other things dynamically assigns the 
interrupts. Maybe it is conflicting with the other sound card
or another PCI device. A few things that you could check:

If you do lspci command does it show both sound cards?

Have you tried getting each sound card working separately 
before trying to get them both working at the same time?

In the BIOS settings there is configuration for PCI slots,
you may be able to do manual setting the PCI slots that 
have the cards installed rather choosing auto.

Two other possible BIOS settings you could try are 
turning of the "PnP Aware OS" setting and turning off
the ACPI setting. If you try these try them one at a time
to see if they make any difference.

It would be worthwhile to try to find out what the error
code -12 means on the following error message
EMU10K1X: probe of 0000:00:0f.0 failed with error -12

Perhaps looking at the alsaconf source code would help
determine what triggers the -12 error and what it means,
depends on if the code is well documented.

BTW I love your email signature, continuing on with the
Williamson quote ... There is nothing enlightened about 
shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around 
you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were 
born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. 
It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let 
our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people 
permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our 
own fear, our presence automatically liberates others ...
