Given the fact I can't remember why I did it, I suppose it was not so
important. The fact it is only in SAMBA_3_0 is indicative I didn't feel
comfortable putting it in the release branch for some reason.

So I'd say we can cut it out.

If it was something we really needed, it will resurface and next time I
hope I will give a better log message :/

Simo.
