When I was working with it for one of the Butterfly iterations
(admittedly about 1 1/2 years ago) it was in pretty bad state, with only
1 person working on it IIRC, and nobody could really help me out with
problems.  It's not had that great of a track record.  So unless it's
gotten a lot of love in the past year, it's probably not the right
approach if you need something in the next few months.
