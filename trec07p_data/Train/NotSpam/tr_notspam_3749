Folks,

Got a question regarding perl code in cgi script.

I am running below line of code in cgi script which doesn't work as
expected.

 my $ticket = qx{echo $p4pass | p4 login -p $p4user};

Basically command has to return a ticket or error message. I keep getting
$ticket as empty.

However, if I write same code in stand alone perl script, it works fine as
expected. Not sure what is going on.

I looked at other options like open(CMD, "| $cmd") and open3. But, not sure
how to get output from the command.

Any idea what is going wrong here.

Nothing in webserver logs too.

Thanks,
Craig.
