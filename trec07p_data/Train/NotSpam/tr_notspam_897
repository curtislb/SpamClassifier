John, I believe that this has been mentioned on the list previously, but
if you don't have convenient access to SAS, they do offer a free
download called the SAS System Viewer. It can read the proprietary SAS
datasets and then enable you to save them as ASCII delimited files.

It is available at the SAS web site here:

http://www.sas.com/apps/demosdownloads/sassystemviewer_PROD_9.1.3_sysdep.jsp?packageID=000313

There is also DBMS/Copy, which is by DataFlux (now a SAS subsidiary).
More information is here:

HTH,

Marc Schwartz
