1. Yes you need a shape file with that information.

2. One place to look is:
http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cob/bdy_files.html There are shapefiles
(the .shp ones) for counties and zip codes (as well as many other
things).  These work pretty directly with the tools in the maptools and
sp packages.

3. Read the .shp file in using maptools, the .dbf information is
automatically read in as well (with whatever details come with the
shapefile), then look at the structure of what you read in, you will see
the data frame and you should be able to just add your data into that
data frame, or use it seperately.

4. plot.Map has an option auxvar, though it is now prefered to use the
plot methods for the more specific objects (SpatialLinesDataFrame object
from the readLinesShape function).  I would expect that they would have
an auxvar or similar argument also.  Or you can decide what color you
want to use, plot the overall map, then add each county/zipcode
individually using the specified color.

Hope this helps,
