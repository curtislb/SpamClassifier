The GPL allows you to charge for the cost of distributing source. If you 
state up front that "if the customer wants source, it's provided on a 
hard disk and costs £100", I can't see a problem.

Indeed, if it's that big, and impractical to provide on DVD, I can't see 
a problem if you *don't* state that up front.

Of course, if you charge £100, you'll get the "gratis software police" 
moaning blue murder that it's not "free" but the GPL (and *F*ree 
Software) isn't interested in that sort of argument. At the end of the 
day, the GPL allows you to recover reasonable costs for distributing 
source, and if you say that the only reasonable way to distribute that 
quantity of source is on hard disk, then they have to pay for it if they 
want it. And you can say to them "well, you put it on a free download 
site then. I don't care!". Unless they've got more money than sense, or 
are desperate to flaunt their "gratis" credentials, they'll back off 
sharply!

Cheers,
Wol
