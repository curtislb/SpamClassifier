Subject: Re: Wireless Router

Just a note on ddwrt/openwrt on the wrt54s, if you're going to increase 
the power on the wireless NIC or overclock the processor as supported by 
certain models, you have to watch the temps...anything over the stock 
settings seems to cause them to heat up quite a bit, and a heatsync or 
fan should be added if you want to leave them in this state for any 
length of time.

Microsoft is not the answer.
Microsoft is the question.
NO (or Linux) is the answer.
