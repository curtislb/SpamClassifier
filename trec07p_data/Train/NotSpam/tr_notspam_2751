Hi all.  For those using linux who have an interest in seeing current
weather conditions, I've written a bash script that gets the weather
info from braille.wunderground.com, and displays the current conditions.

I called the script "conditions".  you just put it in a directory in
your tath, run chmod 755 on the file, and you are rready to go.  You
must have the lynx browser installed in order to use this.

You just type:

conditions Ames Iowa

or some other city state combination, or a zip code, and it displays the
current conditions for that location.  I've included the script at the
end of this message.  Have fun!
