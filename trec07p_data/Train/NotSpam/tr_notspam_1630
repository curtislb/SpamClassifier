That is an easy way to view it. Technically, what you had said before is 
perfectly correct, but
thinking of the file as being licenced under the combination of the 
conditions is also perfectly valid
(as long as you realize that if the parts are seperated, the original lices 
still apply, of course).

In summary, just make sure you meet all the terms of both, and you are fine.
