Hi Jeremy,
First, setting hmax to a small number could prevent a large step, if  
you think that is a problem. Second, however, I don't see how you can  
get a negative population size when using the log trick. I would  
think that that would prevent completely any negative values of N  
(i.e. e^-100000 > 0). Can you explain? or do you want to a void that  
trick? The only other solver I know of is rk4 and it is not recommended.
Hank
