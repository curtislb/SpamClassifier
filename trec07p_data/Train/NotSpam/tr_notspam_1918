Hiya,
    I at least have found it to be a viable alternative so far, and would be 
glad to describe my methodology as best I can.
    I downloaded VMWare server and installed it on Windows.  I then ran the 
VMware Virtual Machine Console, as it's called, and created a new VM.  The 
console GUI is quite easy to navigate, at least with Window-Eyes.
    I had previously downloaded a Gentoo ISO, which I used as my cdrom 
image.  The process of adding a cdrom to the vm is fairly straightforward: 
if someone wants more details I'll add them.
    I also switched the Ethernet adapter--which is an emulated PCnet32 to 
'bridged' mode, because I happen to be on a private network that can handle 
that sort of thing.
    Finally, I booted up the ISO and waited a few seconds, then hit ctrl+g 
to switch the input to the VM.  I gave an ifconfig command to switch eth0 to 
an IP address I knew, changed the password on the root account, and started 
sshd.
    From that point, I just ssh'd into the VM--after hitting ctrl+alt to 
switch input back to Windows.  The Gentoo install, including partitioning 
and kernel compilation, went off without a hitch.  I just made sure to start 
sshd at boot, configure the network appropriately, etc.
I'm glad to answer any questions you may have.  I apologize if this has been 
vague.
I hope I can help.
Thanks,
Zack.
