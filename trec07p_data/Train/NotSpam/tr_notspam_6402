						Tonight on Newsnight we have an exclusive on the links between the bo=
mb plotters found guilty today and the terrorist mastermind behind the 7/7 =
attacks in London. What were the failings of intelligence and did MI5 misle=
ad MPs?=20
<br>
=20
<br>
Home Secretary, John Reid, speaking in the Commons has rejected calls for a=
n inquiry into the 7/7 bombings. He's said MI5 are putting information on t=
heir website, and a parliamentary committee will look at the case again.
<br>
Richard Watson reveals in astonishing detail how the 7/7 ringleader was bei=
ng watched by MI5 and knew the bomb plotters. Shadow Home Secretary David D=
avis reminded the Commons today that the government said the bombings had c=
ome out of the blue. We hope to be getting answers tonight to the key quest=
ions following this trial.=20
<br>

<br>
We're hoping to speak to the Chairman of the Intelligence and Security Comm=
ittee that took evidence from MI5. We should also be joined by opposition p=
oliticians, an intelligence chief, a 7/7 victim and a Muslim community lead=
er. And in the second part of his investigation for the programme tonight R=
ichard Watson goes on the trail of the terror network in the UK and Pakista=
n, confronting the men suspected of organising it.=20=20
<br>

<br>
See you at 10.30pm on BBC2.=20
