I'd like more information on what you're trying to do. For example,
are you trying to summarize what gets covered and what doesn't? Is
"Run" merely an identifying string? Do "In" and "Out" denote the
endpoints of a stream of covered items?

One way to solve that kind of coverage problem, if that's what it is,
is to build a data structure from the input, then output the contents
of the structure in an orderly way. For what I think is your case,
you'd want perhaps a hash whose keys are the run number. Under each
run number, the corresponding value would be the summary of what items
were covered in that run. (If the list of items is a simple list of
integers, you could represent that as a bitmap.)

Hope this helps!
