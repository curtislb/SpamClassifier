4:00 AM, 6/10/07, Update: Shuttle Atlantis closes in on space station=20

The shuttle Atlantis is closing in on the international space station today=
 for a long-awaited linkup to deliver a new crew member and a $367 million =
set of solar arrays. The new arrays are needed to boost the lab's power and=
 help pave the way for arrival of European and Japanese research modules la=
te this year and early next.

Shuttle commander Rick Sturckow will fly a standard rendezvous profile, app=
roaching the lab complex from behind and below. The terminal phase of the r=
endezvous procedure begins with a critical rocket firing at 1 p.m. At that =
point, the shuttle will be trailing the space station by about 9.2 miles.=
=20

On final approach, at a distance of about 600 feet directly below the stati=
on on an imaginary line known as the R-bar, Sturckow will guide Atlantis th=
rough a slow end-over-end flip known as a rotational (or rendezvous) pitch =
maneuver. The RPM maneuver will take about nine minutes to complete - three=
 quarters of a degree per second - allowing the station crew to photograph =
the shuttle's belly with video and digital cameras equipped with 400-mm and=
 800-mm telephoto lenses.

The idea is to document the condition of the shuttle's fragile heat shield =
tiles so engineers at the Johnson Space Center can determine if any impact =
damage might have occurred during launch Friday. The RPM is one of the most=
 effective post-Columbia techniques for spotting critical damage that might=
 pose a threat during re-entry.

An ongoing analysis of launch-day video and a detailed inspection of the sh=
uttle nose cap and wing leading edge panels Saturday is not yet complete. B=
ut so far, there are no indications of any debris impacts from the shuttle'=
s external tank that might cause problems during re-entry.

The most significant anomaly to this point is a 4-inch by 6-inch triangular=
 section of insulation blanket that somehow got pulled up during launch. Th=
e blanket is located on the upper surface of Atlantis' left side Orbital Ma=
neuvering System rocket pod.

"There's not a great deal of concern over it right now, but there's a lot o=
f work to be done and we'll do that in the coming days," John Shannon, chai=
rman of NASA's Mission Management Team, said Saturday.

Temperatures on the upper surfaces of the OMS pods reach 1,000 degrees  in =
places. On the nose cap and wing leading edge panels, it exceeds 3,000 degr=
ees.

The astronauts inspected the nose cap and reinforced carbon carbon leading =
edge panels Saturday. During final approach to the space station today, Exp=
edition 15 commander Fyodor Yurchikhin and flight engineer Oleg Kotov will =
photograph the shuttle's belly as Sturckow guides the ship through the RPM.

"We'll basically fly up the R-bar and then we will look to stop our approac=
h around 600 feet, and we'll do a full 360-degree pivot while the station c=
rew takes photographs of the underside of the space shuttle Atlantis," Stur=
ckow said in a NASA interview.

Kotov will snap 800-mm photos while Yurchikhin will handle the 400-mm lens.=
 The pictures and video will be downlinked later in the day.

With the R-bar pitch maneuver complete, Sturckow will fly Atlantis through =
a slow quarter-loop to a point about 400 feet directly in front of the stat=
ion with the shuttle's tail pointed toward Earth and its open payload bay p=
ointed toward pressurized mating adapter No. 2 on the front of the Destiny =
laboratory module. From there, flying the shuttle from the aft flight deck,=
 Sturckow will manually guide Atlantis to a precision docking.

Here is a timeline of today's activities, including highlights from NASA's =
television schedule (revision C); in EDT and mission elapsed time. NOTE: NA=
SA rounds down when producing its television schedule. Docking, for example=
, is predicted to occur at a mission elapsed time of one day 20 hours zero =
minutes and 40 seconds, or 3:38:40 p.m. In the chart below, that is rounded=
 up to 3:39 p.m. while NASA's TV schedule rounds it down to 3:38 p.m.

After leak checks and hatch opening, Yurchikhin, Kotov and NASA astronaut S=
unita Williams will welcome the shuttle astronauts aboard and provide a qui=
ck safety briefing. Later in the day, Clay Anderson's custom Soyuz seat lin=
er will be transferred to the station and he will officially become a membe=
r of the Expedition 15 crew, sleeping aboard the station while Williams joi=
ns the shuttle crew.

On past flights, rendezvous and docking would have capped a busy day in spa=
ce. But for Atlantis' crew, docking will kick off an equally busy afternoon=
 of work to pull the 36,000-pound S3/S4 solar array truss segment from the =
shuttle's cargo bay so it can be handed off to the station's robot arm and =
safely "parked" overnight.

The S3 (starboard 3) segment features a powerful rotary joint that will slo=
wly rotate the station's right-side solar arrays to keep them face-on to th=
e sun. The S4 segment includes two telescoping solar blankets that will str=
etch 240 feet from tip to tip when fully extended Tuesday.

"The robotic arm operations will actually start immediately after docking, =
but even prior to us opening the hatches between the space shuttle and the =
space station," shuttle pilot Lee Archambault said in a NASA interview. "Ri=
ght after docking Pat Forrester and myself will go ahead and grapple the pa=
yload with the space shuttle robotic arm. This is about a 30-minute procedu=
re. Pat will be flying the arm and I'll be assisting him, but it's kind of =
a tricky procedure in that Pat's going to have to reach across the belly of=
 the shuttle payload bay and over the top of the payload and grab it from t=
he starboard grapple fixture on the payload.

Forrester will have just an inch or so of clearance between S3/S4 and the O=
BSS heat shield inspection boom mounted along the right wall of Atlantis' p=
ayload bay. As he is lifting the payload straight up from its perch in the =
payload bay, he will have to jog it slightly to the left to avoid the OBSS.=
 It is a delicate procedure because of the payload's inertia and the need t=
o avoid any overshoots that could cause it to hit anything.

A similar maneuver was required last September when the P3/P4 truss segment=
s were installed.

"I am what we call R1 for the space shuttle arm," Forrester said in a NASA =
interview. "I will reach into the payload bay of the space shuttle and will=
 grapple the S3/S4 truss. The grapple fixture is on the S3 portion, and rig=
ht after that the hatches will be opened, we=92ll say our hellos to everyon=
e on board station and then we=92ll get right back to work. And, with Lee A=
rchambault as my R2, we will pull the S3/S4 Truss out of the bay, put it th=
rough a series of maneuvers and bring it to a point where we can turn it ov=
er to the computers, what we call automated maneuvers, and then the compute=
rs will fly that arm and the truss section attached out to a position where=
 we can hand it off to the space station robotic arm.

"The S3/S4 weighs about 35,000 pounds, very similar to P3/P4. It=92s just a=
 little bit heavier, and I think to date this will be the heaviest payload =
that we=92ve delivered to station. The folks, the trainers in the robotic a=
rea have simplified things for us and have designed a series of what we wou=
ld call one-axis maneuvers as we bring it out of the bay and then shift it =
a little bit to the port side of the orbiter to move it away from the new b=
oom that we carry for inspections. Then we=92ll bring it out a little bit h=
igher, push it back a little, do a couple other small maneuvers, and then i=
t=92ll be in a position for the computers to fly. So actually it=92s a very=
 simple task."

At that point, Archambault said, "I will hurry over to the space station an=
d then assist Suni Williams, who's one of our space station crew members, a=
nd she will have the space station robotic arm ready to go. She will move i=
n and double grapple, if you will, the payload with the space station robot=
ic arm. And then once we get the payload grappled with the space station ro=
botic arm, it will now be double grappled, and then I'll hurry back over to=
 the space shuttle and then assist Pat in ungrappling the space shuttle rob=
otic arm from the payload, and that's where we'll complete our arm operatio=
ns for that day. We'll leave the payload grappled to the space station robo=
tic arm in that handoff position overnight."

Astronauts Jim Reilly and Danny Olivas will spend the night sealed up in th=
e space station's Quest airlock module as part of a new "camp out" procedur=
e before a planned spacewalk Monday to electrically connect and outfit the =
new truss segment. The airlock's pressure will be lowered from 14.2 pounds =
per square inch to 10.2 psi to help the spacewalkers purge nitrogen from th=
eir blood and prevent the bends when working in their 5-psi spacesuits.

A detailed overview of Monday's spacewalk will be posted later in the day.

After leak checks and hatch opening, Yurchikhin, Kotov and NASA astronaut S=
unita Williams will welcome the shuttle astronauts aboard and provide a qui=
ck safety briefing. Later in the day, Clay Anderson's custom Soyuz seat lin=
er will be transferred to the station and he will officially become a membe=
r of the Expedition 15 crew, sleeping aboard the station while Williams joi=
ns the shuttle crew.<BR>
<BR>
On past flights, rendezvous and docking would have capped a busy day in spa=
ce. But for Atlantis' crew, docking will kick off an equally busy afternoon=
 of work to pull the 36,000-pound S3/S4 solar array truss segment from the =
shuttle's cargo bay so it can be handed off to the station's robot arm and =
safely &quot;parked&quot; overnight.<BR>
<BR>
The S3 (starboard 3) segment features a powerful rotary joint that will slo=
wly rotate the station's right-side solar arrays to keep them face-on to th=
e sun. The S4 segment includes two telescoping solar blankets that will str=
etch 240 feet from tip to tip when fully extended Tuesday.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The robotic arm operations will actually start immediately after dock=
ing, but even prior to us opening the hatches between the space shuttle and=
 the space station,&quot; shuttle pilot Lee Archambault said in a NASA inte=
rview. &quot;Right after docking Pat Forrester and myself will go ahead and=
 grapple the payload with the space shuttle robotic arm. This is about a 30=
-minute procedure. Pat will be flying the arm and I'll be assisting him, bu=
t it's kind of a tricky procedure in that Pat's going to have to reach acro=
ss the belly of the shuttle payload bay and over the top of the payload and=
 grab it from the starboard grapple fixture on the payload.<BR>
<BR>
Forrester will have just an inch or so of clearance between S3/S4 and the O=
BSS heat shield inspection boom mounted along the right wall of Atlantis' p=
ayload bay. As he is lifting the payload straight up from its perch in the =
payload bay, he will have to jog it slightly to the left to avoid the OBSS.=
 It is a delicate procedure because of the payload's inertia and the need t=
o avoid any overshoots that could cause it to hit anything.<BR>
<BR>
A similar maneuver was required last September when the P3/P4 truss segment=
s were installed.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I am what we call R1 for the space shuttle arm,&quot; Forrester said =
in a NASA interview. &quot;I will reach into the payload bay of the space s=
huttle and will grapple the S3/S4 truss. The grapple fixture is on the S3 p=
ortion, and right after that the hatches will be opened, we&#146;ll say our=
 hellos to everyone on board station and then we&#146;ll get right back to =
work. And, with Lee Archambault as my R2, we will pull the S3/S4 Truss out =
of the bay, put it through a series of maneuvers and bring it to a point wh=
ere we can turn it over to the computers, what we call automated maneuvers,=
 and then the computers will fly that arm and the truss section attached ou=
t to a position where we can hand it off to the space station robotic arm.<=
BR>
<BR>
&quot;The S3/S4 weighs about 35,000 pounds, very similar to P3/P4. It&#146;=
s just a little bit heavier, and I think to date this will be the heaviest =
payload that we&#146;ve delivered to station. The folks, the trainers in th=
e robotic area have simplified things for us and have designed a series of =
what we would call one-axis maneuvers as we bring it out of the bay and the=
n shift it a little bit to the port side of the orbiter to move it away fro=
m the new boom that we carry for inspections. Then we&#146;ll bring it out =
a little bit higher, push it back a little, do a couple other small maneuve=
rs, and then it&#146;ll be in a position for the computers to fly. So actua=
lly it&#146;s a very simple task.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
At that point, Archambault said, &quot;I will hurry over to the space stati=
on and then assist Suni Williams, who's one of our space station crew membe=
rs, and she will have the space station robotic arm ready to go. She will m=
ove in and double grapple, if you will, the payload with the space station =
robotic arm. And then once we get the payload grappled with the space stati=
on robotic arm, it will now be double grappled, and then I'll hurry back ov=
er to the space shuttle and then assist Pat in ungrappling the space shuttl=
e robotic arm from the payload, and that's where we'll complete our arm ope=
rations for that day. We'll leave the payload grappled to the space station=
 robotic arm in that handoff position overnight.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Astronauts Jim Reilly and Danny Olivas will spend the night sealed up in th=
e space station's Quest airlock module as part of a new &quot;camp out&quot=
; procedure before a planned spacewalk Monday to electrically connect and o=
utfit the new truss segment. The airlock's pressure will be lowered from 14=
.2 pounds per square inch to 10.2 psi to help the spacewalkers purge nitrog=
en from their blood and prevent the bends when working in their 5-psi space=
suits.<BR>
<BR>
A detailed overview of Monday's spacewalk will be posted later in the day.<=
