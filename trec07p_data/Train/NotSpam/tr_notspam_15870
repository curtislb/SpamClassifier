Thing is, in most (non-American) civilised jurisdictions, the copyright 
holder is likely to get their knees put seriously out of joint by a very 
upset judge.

I'm in the UK, and if I wasn't but the choice of venue specified 
"England and Wales", I'd probably have a very nice holiday at the 
copyright holder's expense :-)

Look at SCOG and how they got dealt with in Germany ...

That said, I don't like venue clauses. In the UK, as a private person it 
is pretty much automatic that if I'm sued, I get to specify venue.

Cheers,
Wol
