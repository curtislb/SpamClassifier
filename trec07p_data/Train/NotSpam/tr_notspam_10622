I am doing the final prep of the DVD-ROM which I plan to be sending to 
MPs by the end of next week. (It will take me a full week to burn the 
307 copies needed) My editor (wife) is still working her way through the 
web pages fixing my mistakes.

This DVD will include dozens of complete examples of art and free 
expression which have been suppressed due to copyright laws. Many of 
them are Canadian. The intent is to illustrate to ours Parliamentarians 
some of the real social costs of overly strong and broad copyright laws; 
and warn them away from making them even stronger and broader.

At present I do not plan on making the media content publicly available. 
I want to limit my liability some what. I will mail a physical DVD to 
anyone who wants one, and I have the text of my own commentaries 
available online at http://dvd.moores.ca

If you or anyone you know would like a physical copy, complete with 
copyright violating derived works, please email me your postal address. 
I will mail out copies to anyone you supply me an address for.
