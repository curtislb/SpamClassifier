Well, if all the works are CC-BY, then anyone and everyone can
do pretty much anything they want with the content, as long as
they maintain attribution. If the website was some
altruistic, non-profit, volunteer organization, then nothing
would prevent Sony from doing something with the content if
they wanted to (as long as they maintain attribution, of course).

That the website is Sony doesn't give Sony an advantage to the
work (unless their user agreement says they get full rights
and everyone else gets CC-BY or something). So, if some altruistic,
non-profit, volunteer organization wants to screen scrape all the
content and host it on their own URL, they would be free to do so.

The fact that Sony has adopted CC-BY for this website is probably
a reason to give them a smile and a thank you. I don't know if
it's worth a celebration yet, though, because they set up the
website to apply CC-BY to other people's works, not their own.

So, I won't be hosting a Sony party just yet.
Maybe when they start releasing some of their own content, I will.
But I won't knock them either. As long as they have to use all
works CC-BY like everyone else, which website pays the bandwidth
is irrelevant to me. Anyone who has the bandwidth and doesn't
like Sony could copy all the CC-BY content to their own website
and do what they want with it, (as long as they attribute).

Hm, I wonder if they have contributers designate their website
for attribution. That would be a little hinky.
