I'd argue that it's an actual saving of resources (for some use  
cases). smbd is 6MB on my system, nmbd is 2MB and winbindd is 4MB. So  
running these cost ~12MB of some combination of swap space and  
physical memory. For a desktop machine, that might only get 1 or 2  
connections a day, that is a useful saving, especially once you start  
adding the saving up across multiple projects.

inetd mode is just fine for desktop usage, but it's too expensive for  
servers that have to handle numbers of simultaneous connection.
