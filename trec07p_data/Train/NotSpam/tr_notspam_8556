Dear Prof. Ripley: 

      1.  I very much appreciate your contributions to the R project. 

      2.  Whether with release 2.4.0 or earlier, I noticed that 
'traceback()' had become less informative.  This loss was more than 
offset when I learned to use the 'debug' function in the 'base' 
package:  It increased my productivity so much that it helped complete 
my transition from S-Plus:  The last few times I had to use S-Plus, I 
ported them to R, got the code working using 'debug', then ported the 
results back to S-Plus.  That was quicker for me than debugging directly 
in S-Plus.

      3.  Thanks again for your many contributions to the R project and 
to my education more generally. 

      Best Wishes,
      Spencer Graves
