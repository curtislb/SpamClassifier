This is a reminder, sent out once a month, about your laptop.org
mailing list memberships.  It includes your subscription info and how
to use it to change it or unsubscribe from a list.

configuration, including unsubscribing, setting digest-style delivery
or disabling delivery altogether (e.g., for a vacation), and so on.

In addition to the URL interfaces, you can also use email to make such
changes.  For more info, send a message to the '-request' address of
the list (for example, mailman-request@laptop.org) containing just the

you with instructions.

If you have questions, problems, comments, etc, send them to
