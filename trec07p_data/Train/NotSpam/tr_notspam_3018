That's exactly what this patch fixes - it changes ":vtable :method :anon" to
":vtable :anon".

I'm talking about how they will be implemented for PDD15. Methods and

Now I see what this interface is intended to accomplish; I was unaware PDD15
was going to be implemented this way.  I still don't like it, for the same
reasons as before, but there's nothing I can do about it, so I'll be happy
to help implement it.  I want to get back to coding now.

In the future, please keep in mind that I don't comment on anything unless I
understand it.  You've tried to explain things to me in several tickets that
I already fully understand.  I am especially surprised you would try to
explain the current implementation of vtable overriding to me, since I
implemented a lot of it.  Thanks.
