maybe this won't help you but if you did open on a dir in perl5 you can
read the raw directory data which is pretty useless in most cases. so
with open working as opendir on directories, what is the op/method to
get the next directory entry? that isn't the same as reading a
line. there won't be any trailing newlines to chomp. marking a location
is not the same with tell and telldir (one is a byte offset, the other a
directory entry index). and since dirs can reorder their entries
(especially hash based dirs) the ordering and seek points may move. not
gonna happen on text files. there are many differences and the only one
you seem to see is a linear scan of them (which is just the most common
access style).

the operations you can do on the handles are very different as well. you
can't write to a dir. dirs have no random access (you can lookup by a
name with open but you can't go to the nth entry). and on OS with extra
stuff like version numbers, then all bets are off.

yes, you can tell the dir is such by doing a stat and then open can dwim
but i don't see the overlap as you do. dirs generally are ordered lists
of strings and have many different underlying formats based on their
file systems. mapping that to a text file of lines doesn't work for me.

this may all be obvious stuff but i think it deserves mentioning. if
dirs mapped well onto file handles they would have been mapped that way
long ago in the OS. in 30+ years that hasn't happened afaik.
