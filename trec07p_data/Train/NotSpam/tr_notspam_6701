09 F9 11 02 9D 74 E3 5B D8 41 56 C5 63 56 88 C0. Wanna know what=92s so =20=

important about it?

The movie industry is threatening Spooky Action at a Distance for =20
publishing that number, specifically with copyright infringement.

I had no idea a number could be copyrighted.

Anyhow, what is it? =46rom the site:

It=92s the HD-DVD Processing Key for most movies released so far. I was =20=

not aware that a string of numbers and letters was copyrightable. =20
Perhaps its just my ignorance but it seems that someone is abusing =20
the DMCA again.

This means the (admittedly long) number is precisely the key you need =20=

in order to decrypt and watch HD-DVD movies in Linux (oh, okay, maybe =20=

software is also required). And the fact that it=92s out there, =20
spreading like wildfire, is killing the types at the movie studios =20
right now.

Now, even if this number stopped working (and it will, thanks to the =20
revocation procedures in HD-DVD=92s encryption scheme) or if it were a =20=

hoax, the decryption system has already been figured out and is =20
implemented in a software program called BackupHDDVD.

We did it with DVDs and DeCSS, and today I can use my trusty MPlayer =20
to play any DVD movie. We will eventually (rather soon) view HD-DVDs =20
in Linux as well (because the codecs are already there, even if they =20
are illegal in some countries).

Let=92s show them no amount of DMCA will stop us.

Oh, do you crave for source code? Let the Doom9 forums answer your =20
prayers. If you=92d like an explanation in news format, WIRED may be =20
what you were looking for.
