No, I'm not, I'm referring to the second sentence in the document,
'We promise that the Debian system and all its components will be free
according to these guidelines.'.

Sure, they are technically being distributed, but not as something
the social contract cares about. (Pardon the personification.)

My point exactly. There is no reason to apply the "we must clarify
everything and anything in order to not get sued" legal logic.

It is being considered on its merits, it's not dismissed because it's
"not immediately obvious", but because it's "nitpicking".

Except that we seem to disagree on whether the obligatory distribution of
licenses, regardless of their own license, falls under the "that" which we
promised never to do.
