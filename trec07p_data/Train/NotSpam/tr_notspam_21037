That reminds me of a Jarkko quote from p5p:

"Crashes Perl (or Used To)" is not a really useful classifying 
criterion, it's about as useful as "the number of characters in 
the test is divisible by 73".

If the test exercises something that's easy or possible to get wrong in any 
implementation, it belongs in the appropriate classification for that feature 
type for all implementations.
