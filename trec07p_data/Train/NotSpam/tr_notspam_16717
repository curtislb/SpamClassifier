Would personally rather something that's not x86 if I was going to put 
together a sub-laptop linux machine.  Seems the smaller/slower 
imbedded processors like strongarm are far better on heat and power 
consumption.  Especially since it would most likely just run a simple 
console maybe with a menu system thrown on top the slower processor 
wouldn't matter so much.

There are no threads in a.b.p.erotica,  so there's no  gain in using a
