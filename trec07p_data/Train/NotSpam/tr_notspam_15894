<strong>Clinton, Giuliani on top in latest poll</strong>

MANCHESTER, New Hampshire (CNN) — A new national poll out this morning shows no change at the top when it comes to the battle for the Democratic Presidential Nomination.

Senator Barack Obama is 15 points behind, with former Senator John Edwards in third place at 11 percent. All other candidates are in single digits.
