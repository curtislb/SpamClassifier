I suppose that as a non-native English speaker you've never eaten
"corned beef hash". I quote from Wikipedia:
"Hash is a mixture of beef (often leftovers of corned beef or roast
beef), onions, potatoes, and spices that are mashed together into a
coarse, chunky paste, and then cooked, either alone, or with other
ingredients."

It's a bit of a working-class dish, for using up your leftovers, so not
the sort of thing you'd eat as a tourist, but it seems many other
countries have the same sort of thing: using your leftovers is a pretty
universal need.

In colloquial English there's also the expression, "to make a hash of
something," which means to make a mess of it, to screw up.

That said, the dish and the idiom are both dying out, and the current
generation of school leavers might not have heard of either. I didn't
make the connection until Larry described it as being "disordered".=20

As a general point, I think it's pretty easy to make a mental
distinction between a 5ish hash and a hashtable, just as it's easy to
remember that 5's abstracted lists and arrays aren't the same concepts
as linked lists and C-style concrete arrays.
