Dear All,

We are developing a web server, actually an email based server.
The server should do the following :

1. Accept  email and a data file  from user
2. Give a resopnse to user as input and emai recieved and submit process
in backend and run it at the same time the html page should completed its
login.
3. Sent results to user.

I have done with step 1 and 3, but having problem with step 2 I am able to
print the status message regarding inputs and am running other
programs from this page using `perl run_programname.pl > $query.html`. The
page is getting loaded on its own time, if I am submitting a big data file
the process is teminating as well(due to
server request-response time).

I need to implement a perl script that will generate response page and at
the same time submit the program to  the  server and once it is done, it
should send a mail.


Many thanks for inputs,
Shameer
