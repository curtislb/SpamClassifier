Hi there,
I guess you've run into a problem we had a while back where speakup would fail to find a dectalk express even though 
there was one connected.  This is somewhat fixed in cvs, but I suppose the grml people don't have a recent cvs snapshot 
of speakup.  Perhaps we should inform them to check out speakup.  Even so, getting dectalk to speak still sometime 
requires some effort.  If it doesn't speak on boot, we occasionally have to type
echo dectlk > /proc/speakup/synth_name
 twice in order to get speech.

Hope this helps.
Josh
