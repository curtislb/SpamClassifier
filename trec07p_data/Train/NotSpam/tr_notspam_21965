You have  been automatically  removed from  the CNN-DAILYTOP10  list (CNN
Daily Top 10 Mailing List) as a result of repeated delivery error reports
from your  mail system. This  decision was  based on the  automatic error
monitoring policy  in effect for the  list, and has not  been reviewed or
otherwise confirmed  by a human  being. If  you receive this  message, it
means that  something is wrong: while  you are obviously able  to receive
mail, your mail system has been regularly reporting that your account did
not exist, or that you were otherwise permanently unable to receive mail.
Here is some information which may assist  you or your local help desk in
determining the cause of the problem:

- The failing address is ktwarwic@SPEEDY.UWATERLOO.CA.

- The first error was reported on 22 Jun 2007.

- Since then, a total of 4 delivery errors have been received.

- The last reported error was: Probe failed.

PLEASE DO NOT  IGNORE THIS MESSAGE. While you can  of course re-subscribe
to the list, it is important for  you to report this problem to your mail
administrator so that  it can be solved. This problem  is not specific to
the CNN-DAILYTOP10 list,  and also affects your private  mail. This means
that YOU HAVE  PROBABLY LOST SOME PRIVATE MAIL AS  WELL. Anyone trying to
write to you  during the same time frame will  probably have received the
same errors  for the same reason.  The CNN-DAILYTOP10 list is  but one of
the many people who may have tried to write to you while your mail system
was malfunctioning.
