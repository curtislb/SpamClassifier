False. Box proved ~ca 1952 that standard inferences in the linear regression
model are robust to nonnormality, at least for (nearly) balanced designs.
The **crucial** assumption is independence, which I suspect partially
motivated his time series work on arima modeling. More recently, work on
hierarchical models (e.g. repeated measures/mixed effect models) has also
dealt with lack of independence.

 The normality of the residuals is important in the inference procedures for
the classical linear regression model, and normality is very important in
correlation analysis (second moment)...
