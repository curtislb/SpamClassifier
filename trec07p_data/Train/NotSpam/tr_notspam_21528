Well, we tried to avoid the stale-mate discussion, but it's back again.

IMO, POD6 should not provide the possibility to build such tools: it
should *be* the tool. With a nice (compact) standard definition how
to document each of the designed features in Perl6, and in attachment
C some details which explain how Ben Smylers can live in anarchy ;-)

Nah, at least a lot more people are thinking about the subject now.

If you read it well, I say: "it's a waste of time if the idea of
orthogonalism (full code and doc separation) cannot be discussed".
Because my plans are exactly the opposite: optimally merging doc
and code.  So, it is only a "no" when @Larry says "no".
