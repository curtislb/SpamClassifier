Errr, we used to do this. I knew about this problem when
I first wrote the locking code and added such a scanner
(and it was every 10 seconds).

Has this scan been lost ?

If so I can now more easily retry it as we know if it's 
a lock that was blocked by POSIX not Windows (for which
we'll get a message).
