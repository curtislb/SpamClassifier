Hi John and Daniel,

Thanks for your suggestions, I updated line 127 of the
sas.get function  but after submitting the following
command:
 
c<- sas.get(lib="c:\\ghan", mem="mkds0001", var=("   "),
format.library="d:\\R\\R-2.4.1",
sasprog='"C:\\Programmi\\SAS\\SAS 9.1\\sas.exe"') (also
trying with sasprog="C:\\Programmi\\SAS\\SAS 9.1\\sas.exe")

the log signaled the following error:

Errore in system(paste(shQuote(sasprog), shQuote(sasin),
"-log", shQuote(log.file)),  : 
        unused argument(s) (output = FALSE)

which is about the modified 127 line.

I've also tried with export files, with the  sasxport.get
function, it works out well, but only if the length of the
variables' names' is maximum 8 bites.

regards,

Anna Emilia Martino
