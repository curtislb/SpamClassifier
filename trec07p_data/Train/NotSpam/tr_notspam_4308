Hello,

Does someone know if there is some kind of "start menu" or "quick menu" for
the Linux console?
I mean a menu based program that would be activated each login, where I
could put the names of the programs I have installed to choose from.

I was wondering for example if it's possible to port and install the Oralux
Speakup menu on my Gentoo system. That would be nice...

Cheers,
Cleverson
