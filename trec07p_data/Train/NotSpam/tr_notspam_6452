   I am wondering if some of the lawyers/legal students can comment on 
this US court cases.  I haven't read the source ruling yet, but noticed 
some interesting commentary in:

Supreme Court sides with Microsoft in patent spat
http://news.com.com/Supreme+Court+sides+with+Microsoft+in+patent+spat/2100-1014_3-6180188.html

     "I think it shows, if not hostility, a reluctance to see patent law
     applied more broadly than absolutely necessary," Leibnitz said, adding
     that the ruling will impact the whole software sector as well as other
     industries. "The Supreme Court is talking about not just software, but
     prototypes that are sent abroad...templates or blueprints or any other
     idea that gets sent abroad that needs to be combined with something
     physical in order to potentially infringe."


   In this case "gold master" CDs of Microsoft software are sent abroad 
where copies are made and installed on hardware.  The US court is 
suggesting that software patents only apply when they are combined with 
hardware (that whole "new machine" legal theory I saw in CIPO's new 
MOPOP), and are not infringing when they are only in intangible form (IE: 
software ideas on a CD).

   An interesting question: if patentable software is combined with 
hardware in a jurisdiction that doesn't honour bogus software patents (I 
consider all information/mental process patents to be bogus), can this 
combination be imported back into the USA?

   Is the issue the location of the hardware/software combination when they 
are combined, or when the information/mental process patent is followed 
(IE: when the software is executed)?


   It is interesting how the US Supreme Court is weighing in quite 
differently than the speciality patent courts who have spent years 
expanding the scope of US patent law to apply to areas that reasonable 
persons wouldn't consider to be inventions.

   It is also interesting to see Microsoft on the side of reducing the 
applicability of software patents, given software patents are one of the 
greatest tools against their greatest and realistically only real 
competitors: FLOSS
