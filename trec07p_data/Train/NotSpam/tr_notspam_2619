Looks pretty good to me, but of course web app authors should take a 
closer look too.  We should get ccHost up to this point. (-;

Also, one sore point I've heard a lot lately is that many people who share 
their work under CC licenses don't make it clear how they should be 
attributed.  For example:

http://www.flickr.com/photos/joi/455919219/ ->
http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/ has the text,
"You must attribute the work in the manner specified by the author or 
licensor"

Well, what's the name to use for this photographer?  "Joi"?  "joi@flickr"?

http://www.flickr.com/photos/joi/455919219/ ->
http://www.flickr.com/photos/joi/ ->
http://www.flickr.com/people/joi/ has the text, "About Joi / Joi Ito".

Which is the one formally specified for attributors to use?

-- Asheesh.
