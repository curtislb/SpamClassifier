Probably more than one thing.  I would suggest reading the following
books to learn Perl and to only use random tutorials on the Internet
as starting points to learn more by reading perldoc.

1.  The Llama --  Learning Perl (read cover to cover)
2.  The Staghound? -- Perl Best Practices (read cover to cover)
3.  The Camel -- Programming Perl (read cover to cover eventually, but
focus on areas where you have questions)
4.  The Panther -- Advanced Perl Programming (read cover to cover)

All told that is about $169.80 plus tax.  Of course, since they are
all O'Reilly books, you can just sign up for Safari Books for about
$20 a month and read them online.
