Hallo cc-community,

I just subscribed to the list on advise of BjornW of Simuze.
I'm Erik Visser and live in Amsterdam.
Graduated as an artist I am, next to the founder of the publicworks  
foundation, a passionate vlogger and blogger and happy user of cc  
since its introduction.
I'm not a wealthy man nor I'm I a code wizard. Within my work I'm an  
'interaction designer' or anything that relates to that title. I  
create ideas and concepts for clients (mostly in the cultural sector)  
and have a broad knowledge of internet and new media.

I have an idea I want to put to the community and see if you can give  
me pointers in creating a valid, practical service for all to enjoy.
I already mailed the idea to cc.org, but Bjorn told me within the  
community there are more people with similar idea's and maybe we can  
put our heads together and create something beautiful.

Here it is:

I'm a very active vlogger and blogger for quite some years now and  
intent to do this for a long time to come.
In my two years of videoblogging I have cut away a lot of video stuff  
that I liked quite a lot and have a universal quality or theme.
I would love to put it out there for the cc community to use within  
their projects or personal video's.
I know the broadcasters have such a system and you can also buy video  
on for example istockphoto.com.
I notice that there is becoming an increasing need for stuff like  
this within the vlogger community.
And will become more and more needed in the future.

So I was thinking of creating a database of video shots and put them  
on a special website.
At first I thought of using Wordpress as an engine, but then I  
thought I should take it more serious and look for better ways to  
disclose the video content to the people who need it.
Like Bjorn for example told me to look at cchost. Do people agree or  
have other suggestions?

I think the goal is quite simple. Finding what you need quick and  
easy in a way you are used to.
And having the cc rights straight when you decide to use it.

I already taken the liberty to register ccvideo.org.
I also have a colocated server I can put to use for this project and  
are more then willing to get my hands dirty.
I hope that this community can help me make it happen.


greetings
Erik Visser
