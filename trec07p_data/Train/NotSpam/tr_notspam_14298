Creative Commons, the Open Rights Group and Free Culture UK are pleased to
announce the first London CC-Salon event, to be held in Shoreditch on
Thursday 28th June 2007.

The CC Salon is a monthly event focused  on building a community of artists
and developers around Creative Commons  licenses, standards, and technology,
and have been running with great success in cities around the world,
including San Francisco, Berlin  and Johannesberg. All are welcome,
especially anyone interested in Creative Commons, copyright, Free Culture,
Open Source, art, media, and music.

CC-Salon will held on the last Thursday  of every month, at Juno, 135
Shoreditch High Street, London E1 6JE, from 6.30pm until midnight. The June
event will feature contributions from:


Tom Reynolds (Random Acts of Reality - http://randomreality.blogware.com)

Elizabeth Stark (Free Culture USA - http://www.freeculture.org)

Jonathan Roberts (FreeMeDVD - http://questionsplease.org/freeme)

and after-dinner.net DJs

In addition, we've got 100 free Magnatune.com <http://magnatune.com/> gift
vouchers to give away, courtesy of John Buckman. Each voucher is worth $8,
or one album from Magnatune's large and eclectic catalogue of DRM-free,
CC-licenced music.

There's plenty more planned for future events, and we'd love to hear from
anyone interested in participating,  whether by performing, exhibiting work,
or giving a talk or presentation.  Please email tim@ccsalon-london.org.uk if
this sounds like you!
