SatCon Announces Certification of It's Photovoltaic PowerGate(R)
Inverters for Commercial Photovoltaic Applications

Alternative Energy Subsidiary's Backlog Exceeds $21 Million 


BOSTON, Apr 25, 2007 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- SatCon Technology Corporation(R)
(Nasdaq CM: SATC), a developer of power management and system
architecture solutions for the alternative energy and distributed power
markets today announced that it has obtained certification of its
PowerGate(R) Inverter product-line for commercial photovoltaic
applications to the new UL standard coming into effect May 7, 2007. In
January of 2006, SatCon announced certification under the new UL1741 of
its innovative ground fault detection interrupter (patent pending)
resulting in significant savings for installers of photovoltaic systems.
This new certification for the entire product-line is a follow on to
that approval. 

With SatCon's continued industry leadership, its wholly owned
subsidiary, SatCon Power Systems Canada is pleased to report that as of
the date of this press release it's backlog has grown from the $16
million reported in September of 2006 to over $21 million today. This
backlog has grown while revenues have increased over 200% to $8.6
million in the last six months of 2006 as compared to the same period of
2005. 

"Our strategy to focus our alternative energy business and complementary
power distribution products continues to drive our backlog and revenue
growth", said Clemens van Zeyl, President of SatCon's Power Systems
subsidiary. "With approval of our existing product-line to the new UL
standard in hand, our focus will now be on the introduction of our next
generation PowerGate(R) Inverter designed for increased capacity while
offering additional value added features to our customers".
