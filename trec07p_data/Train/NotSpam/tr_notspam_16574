						Today's Quote for the Day:
<br>

<br>
"Labour has proved to be the most centralising and authoritarian Government=
 in living memory, and the Tories cannot decide where they stand" - Liberal=
 Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell.
<br>

In tonight's programme:=20
<br>

<br>
<b>Robin Hood in Reverse</b>
<br>

<br>
Vulture funds rob the poor to fatten the rich. As we revealed on Newsnight,=
 they are a crafty mechanism which allows the buying up of the debts of dev=
eloping countries rather cheaply - and then the debt owner takes his money =
back, at a huge profit. The poor lose.=20
<br>

<br>
As the G8 leaders assemble tomorrow in Germany, Zombie Brown and President =
Bush are taking an interest. I'll be asking the British government minister=
 responsible whether, realistically, anything can be done to stop the vultu=
res preying on the poor.
<br>

<br>
<b>The Cameron Clan</b>
<br>

<br>
The row within the Conservatives over grammar schools rumbles on, with some=
 Conservatives (quietly) suggesting it has undermined David Cameron's autho=
rity. Michael Crick is on the trail - and we hope to hear from both sides.=
=20
<br>

<br>
<b>Wine</b>
<br>

<br>
The government wants to clamp down on middle class binge drinking. Our Scie=
nce Editor Susan Watts will tell you how much wine you can safely drink eac=
h day.
<br>
=20
<br>
<b>Web 2.0</b>
<br>

<br>
The stuff you read on the internet. Do you believe it? Seriously? Why? We'l=
l be hearing from the author of a new book about why much of what you may b=
e reading has all the editorial authority of graffiti on a lavatory wall, a=
nd a Web defender will explain why the democratisation of the web is so imp=
ortant.
<br>

<br>
You can read extracts from the book, The Cult of the Amateur, and join the =
debate by <b><a href=3D"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/newsnight/2007/06/the_cu=
lt_of_the_amateur_by_andrew_keen.html">clicking here</b></a>.

<br>
<b>And finally...</b>
<br>

<br>
Newsnight viewer Terry Yates suggests that my Jokes Fit For an Eleven Year =
old have missed out on Musician Jokes. I did not know there was an importan=
t sub-genre like this, but Terry offers the following - perhaps you have mo=
re?=20=20
<br>
=20
<br>
What is the definition of "Perfect Pitch"?
<br>

<br>
Answer - Throwing a Banjo into a well without touching the sides.
