Well, I meant that comment to apply to myself not you.  After
rereading it I see where you would consider that I was referring to you
which I was not.  I apologize for not being more clear on that point.

I meant to say that I do not want to be a list Nazi about what issues
should or should not be discussed within the realms of what I outlined
in the other post that is.  So *no* dialogues on irritating yappy
little dogs that represent non-food organizations pretending to be
Mexican cuisine.
