Andreas,
this kind of question would be served better if posted on
samba-technical@samba.org as it is about technical matters.

If you don't have fork, and have a btter I/O API I'd direct you at
looking at samba4.

Samba4 can run in a single process.

Samba4 integrates the NBT functionality without requiring a second
daemon.

In Samba4 you can write NTVFS modules without necessarily using posix
semantics (like samba3 vfs layer require instead).

While samba4 is still not released it should be ok for the kind of use
you have in mind.

Samba4 can have a better memory footprint as well.

Simo.
