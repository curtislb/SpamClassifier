Hi Rolf,

i could not get what to be done with that kind of plot. If possible then i 
would also like to contribute in its development. Thanks for discussion, 
If you have any pointers please let me know in R.

Thanks  in adv.
with warm regards,
-gaurav

                 Many years ago I picked up from the snews mailing list a
                 suite of functions for plotting 2D barplots (barplots 
with 2D
                 bases) written by a chap named Colin Goodall, from (at 
that
                 time) the University of Bristol and/or from Penn State.

                 I never actually did anything with this suite until
                 recently.  Seeing no replies to the enquiry about 3D
                 histograms,  I thought I'd try to get Goodal's code 
running
                 in R to see if it might solve guarav's problem.

                 The trouble is, all the guts of the procedure, 
*including*
                 the plotting are done from within Fortran.  The actual
                 plotting seems to be done through a call to a subroutine
                 ``segmtz'' which is a piece of Splus software that does 
not
                 exist in R.

                 Is there an equivalent subroutine in R that could be 
called?
                 I dug around a bit but couldn't figure out what was going
                 on.  The function segments() simply calls
                 .Internal(segments(....

                 I looked around a bit for corresponding C or Fortran code 
but
                 obviously didn't know how to look properly.

                 I think that the Fortran code could be translated into 
raw R
                 and the call to segmtz changed to a call to segments() 
---
                 but this would seem to be a lot of work.

                 Can anyone suggest a reasonably simple way of replacing 
the
                 call to segmtz in the Fortran?

                                        cheers,

                                                Rolf Turner
                                                rolf@math.unb.ca
