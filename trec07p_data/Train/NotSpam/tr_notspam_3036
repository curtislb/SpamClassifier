greenbird sends in word that [0]Techdirt has up information from Daniel
Berninger documenting prior art in the Verizon patents being used to
[1]destroy Vonage. "...due to the fun way the patent system works,
introducing that kind of prior art to the USPTO for it to review the
validity of Verizon's VoIP patents will take quite a bit of time and
effort â€” much longer than Vonage has to fight Verizon in court." From
Berninger's note: "In particular, the claims in both patents were
anticipated by open standards assembled by the VoIP Forum (H.323) in 1996
and published in January 1997 with the participation of members from
Cisco Systems, Microsoft, IBM, Nortel, Intel, Motorola, Lucent, and
VocalTec Communications, among others... The Eric Voit patent
applications reflect, in particular, contributions made by VocalTec
Communication to the VoIP Forum during 1996 and formally published at the
same time as a separate document."

[0]eldavojohn writes "PhysOrg is covering an interesting year-old paper
that proposes an [1]alternative six-dimensional theory of space and time.
[2]George Sparling's proposition, based on Einstein's general relativity
and Elie Cartan's triality, is a twistor space (which I've only read of
in [3]Roger Penrose's latest work). The gist is that space-time is
modeled not by four dimensions but by six, and that the extra two
dimensions are time-like. Sparling is hoping that tests from the Large
Hadron Collider will help prove his theory. [4]The paper is heavy but the
PhysOrg article summarizes it nicely."

is an absolutely amazing product for web browsing. However, it's targeted
at a very exclusive market: pure technology admirers who must have the
latest and greatest, regardless of its real world functionality. We
wouldn't recommend you place all of your critical information on the
N800, due to its limited online connectivity options and lack of a
portable form factor, especially if you are a professional. But if you
must have the N800, we would recommend only using it as a digital
newspaper to stay abreast on the latest news, and get work done online.
It's just too much of an independent platform to be able to replace
anything else, such as a notebook, a smartphone or a cell phone."

Slashdot contributor [0]Bennett Haselton writes in to say "The last few
times that I sued a spammer in Washington Small Claims Court, I filed a
"booby-trapped" written legal brief with the judge, about four pages
long, with the second and third pages stuck together in the middle. I
made these by poking through those two pages with a thumbtack, then
running a tiny sliver of paper through the holes and gluing it to either
page with white-out. The idea was that after the judge made their
decision, I could go to the courthouse and look at the file to see if the
judge read the brief or not, since if they turned the pages to read it,
the tiny sliver of paper would break. To make a long story short, I tried
this with 6 different judges, and in 3 out of 6 cases, the judge rejected
the motion without reading it." The rest of this bizarre story follows.
It's worth the read.

pressing issues have declared their intent to [1]avoid another browser
war. All the panelists agreed that security was the largest concern
currently facing browser developers. "Brendan Eich, the chief technology
officer at Mozilla, said that security was hard and always will be. 'I
don't think we should take security lightly; it's an end-to-end problem
and we have to step outside the current model to win on this front,' he
said. For his part, Chris Wetherell, a software engineer at Google, said
one of the scenarios that kept him awake at night was offline access to
the browser and what that meant from a security perspective, particularly
on the user-to-user front."

the Wall Street Journal reports. The ambitious Fora.tv, for example,
intends to establish relations with all of the lecture series from the
nation's scores of think tanks, civic groups, bookstores and the like,
and then put tapes of their speeches and panel discussions online in an
easily searchable fashion."

[0]Michael J. Ross writes "MySQL may be the most popular open source
relational database management system (RDBMS) in the world, but during
the first decade of its existence, it lacked support for stored programs,
i.e., store procedures, functions, and triggers. The major commercial
RDBMS vendors â€” including Oracle, IBM, and Microsoft â€” could point to
this deficiency as reason enough to choose their proprietary systems over
MySQL or any other open source system, such as PostgreSQL. But with the
release of MySQL version 5.0, in October 2005, the "little database
engine that could" dramatically improved its position against the
competition. The most comprehensive discussion of these new capabilities
is in the book MySQL Stored Procedure Programming." Read below for the
rest of Michael's review

An anonymous reader writes "British scientists have announced their
intent to build a Star Trek-style [0]magnetic shielding system to help
protect astronauts from radiation. 'There are a variety of risks facing
future space explorers, not least of which is the cancer-causing
radiation encountered when missions venture beyond the protective
magnetic envelope, or magnetosphere, which shields the Earth against
these energetic particles. The Earth's magnetosphere deflects many of
these particles; others are largely absorbed by the atmosphere.'"

Ollabelle writes "The BBC is reporting how [0]tiny chips with flexible
skins could be used to glide through a planet's atmosphere in swarms to
gather data and report back. 'The idea of using millimetre-sized devices
to explore far-flung locations is nothing new, but Dr Barker and his
colleagues are starting to look in detail at how it might be achieved.
The professor at Glasgow's Nanoelectronics Research Centre told delegates
at the Royal Astronomical Society gathering that computer chips of the
size and sophistication required to meet the challenge already existed.'"

[0]DragonTHC asks: "I just visited [1]Movielink's website for research.
Their site has a nice message saying, 'Sorry, but in order to enjoy the
Movielink service you must use Internet Explorer 5.0 (or higher) or
Mozilla/Firefox with an IE Tab Extension (IE installation required).'
While allowing the [2]IETab Firefox extension is somewhat progressive,
why do companies still force people to use Internet Explorer? Surely the
site should work just fine in Firefox? With [3]Firefox's steady gains in
market share, you would think that webmasters would get the hint. If you
are a webmaster, what are your reasons for forcing IE?"
