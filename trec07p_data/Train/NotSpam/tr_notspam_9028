You're trying to compile an ancient, no-longer maintained piece of code 
that hasn't worked since at least 2000 because it requires an old 2.2 
kernel.  The only Dectalk PC driver that works is the one that comes with 
Speakup, and even that isn't too reliable from my experience.  I no longer 
have a computer with ISA slots, so don't know if it has gotten any better.
