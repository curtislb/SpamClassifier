Martin Tétreault is probably one of the higher-profile PQ artists who  
might have run into trouble at some point (he got started doing  
turntable manipulation in the same vein as Christian Marclay), but as  
far as I know, he's primarily worked with Frankenstein turntables and  
homemade textured platters to play on them for the last decade or so.  
Which... really isn't that helpful, I guess, but it's a name that  
came to mind.
