An anonymous reader writes "Twenty-four federal departments and agencies
earned [0]a collective grade of C-minus last year for their performance
in meeting computer and network security requirements, according to marks
handed out by a key congressional oversight committee today. The
government-wide grade is up slightly from the 2005, when it earned an
overall grade of D+. Eight agencies earned A grades, while as many
warranted failing marks. '..the Department of Defense led a group of
eight agencies that received failing marks for computer security. Also
receiving that dubious distinction were the departments of Agriculture,
Commerce, Education, Interior, State and Treasury, as well as the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission. The Department of Homeland Security earned a D,
although its overall performance improved since 2005. The Department of
Veterans Affairs did not provide enough data to earn a grade. In 2005, it
received an F.'"

been having trouble running on the old IBM servers ibiblio uses, so they

GoSun wrote in with an article about [0]new solar panels that opens,
"Sunlight has never really caught fire as a power source, mostly because
generating electricity with solar cells is more expensive and less

this month by the Georgia Tech Research Institute hopes to brighten the
future of the energy source." The new panels are able to produce sixty
times the current of traditional models.

shows [2]how easy it is to break the protection of the stick. Quoting:
'It should be clear that the stick's security is quite useless: a simple
program can be used to fool the Secustick into sending its unlock command
without knowing the password. Besides, the password.exe application can
be adapted so that it accepts arbitrary passwords.' The manufacturer got

[0]forgethistory sends us to PhysOrg for a summary of new research
suggesting that the near instantaneous energy transfer achieved by
[1]photosynthesis may rely on quantum effects. From the article: "Through
photosynthesis, green plants and cyanobacteria are able to transfer
sunlight energy to molecular reaction centers for conversion into
chemical energy with nearly 100-percent efficiency. Speed is the key —
the transfer of the solar energy takes place almost instantaneously so
little energy is wasted as heat. How photosynthesis achieves this near
instantaneous energy transfer is a long-standing mystery that may have
finally been solved."

[0]dido writes "In his most recent column, Robert X. Cringely observes
that [1]network neutrality may have never really existed at all. It
appears that some, perhaps all, of the major broadband ISPs have been
implementing tiered service levels for a long time. From the article:
'What turns out to be the case is that some ISPs have all along given
priorities to different packet types. What AT&T, Comcast and the others
were trying to do was to find a way to be paid for priority access —
priority access that had long existed but hadn't yet been converted into
a revenue stream.'" Cringely comes to this conclusion after being unable
to get a fax line working. His assumption that the (Vonage) line's
failure to support faxing is due to Comcast packet prioritizing is not
really supported or proved. But his main point about the longstanding
existence of service tiering will come as no surprise to this community.

[1]can never replace desktop applications, for a variety of reasons. He
writes, 'Some of you may point out that the data stored on your hard
drive is not of any real consequence, but I would disagree. It is more
than probable that a skilled, disgruntled employee of the company you
trust with your data could ... sell off your personal information.' Given
the real danger of privacy concerns, identity theft, and uptime, will
web-based applications ever truly replace locally hosted software?"

using a fuzzer [2](screenshots) has been discounted by Microsoft, which
claims that the crashes and malformed Word documents [3]are a feature of
Word, not a bug. Microsoft's Security Response Center is also refusing to
classify the flaws as security problems. [4]According to Microsoft
developer David LeBlanc, crashes aren't necessarily DoS situations: 'You
may rightfully say that crashing is always bad, and having a server-class
app background, I agree. Crashing means you made a mistake, bad
programmer, no biscuit. However, crashing may be the lesser of the evils
in many places. In the event that our apps crash, we have recovery
mechanisms, ways to report the crash so we know what function had the
problem, and so on. I really take issue with those who would characterize
a client-side crash as a denial of service.' Computerworld's Frank Hayes
responds to LeBlanc and [5]questions Microsoft's logic.'"

KingKong writes "[0]Scientists have unraveled the DNA of another of our
primate relatives, this time a monkey named the rhesus macaque — and the
work has far more immediate impact than just to study evolution. These
fuzzy animals are key to testing the safety of many medicines, and
understanding such diseases as AIDS, and the new research will help
scientists finally be sure when they're a good stand-in for humans.
'Having a third primate will allow scientists to compare the three
genomes, with an added emphasis on singling out the genes possessed by
humans alone. The end goal is to reconstruct the history of every single
one of the approximately 20,000 genes, to determine when they first
appeared in history, and in what species. All of this requires an
extraordinary amount of information.'"

em.' Samsung, one of the main backers of the Blu-ray Disc format, Friday
said it plans to [1]release an optical disc player this year that will
play both Blu-ray Disc and the rival HD DVD format. With the
announcement, Samsung becomes the second company to shift from a
single-format stance (LG launched a dual player in North America earlier
this year.) 'Our main concern is with the consumer and not a particular
technology,' said Samsung spokesman Kwak Bumjoon."

[0]SeaDour writes "The famous [1]Deep Impact mission, which in 2005
launched a projectile in the path of comet Tempel 1, [2]may be extended
by NASA. The proposal is to slingshot the probe around the Earth as it
passes by at the end of this year, putting it on a trajectory to reach
comet Boethin in December 2008. Scientists want to see if the strange
composition and behavior of Tempel 1 is more common than they had
previously assumed. (The probe only had one projectile though, so we will
not see another brilliant man-made explosion on this comet.)
Additionally, while the probe is en route to the comet, researchers will
point its on-board telescope at known exosolar planets to determine the
compositions of their atmospheres."

[0]1sockchuck writes "Just days after Google announced that it may build
a huge data center in the state, Oklahoma's governor has [1]signed a bill
into law that will effectively exempt the largest customers of municipal
power companies from public disclosure of how much power they are using.
Officials of the state's power industry say the measure is not a 'Google
Law' but was sought 'on behalf of large-volume electric users that might
be considering a move to Oklahoma.' Others acknowledge that data center
operators were among those seeking the law, apparently arguing that the
details of their enormous power usage are a trade secret. Google recently
acquired [2]800 acres in Pryor, Oklahoma for possible development as a
data center, and is reportedly seeking up to 15 megawatts of power for
the facility."

Londovir asks: "Recently, our school board made the decision to block
Wikipedia from our school district's WAN system. This was a complete
block — there aren't even provisions in place for teachers or
administrators to input a password to bypass the restriction. The reason
given was that Wikipedia (being user created and edited) did not
represent a credible or reliable source of information for schools.
Should we block sites such as Wikipedia because students may be exposed
to misinformation, or should we encourage sites such as Wikipedia as an
outlet for students to investigate and determine the validity of the
information?"

mrneutron2004 writes wrote with a link to an article on The Register,
discussing an annual IT security report card handed out to the federal
government. The results this year were mixed. The good news is that they
graded higher than last year. The bad news? [0]They still just rate a C-".
Individual departments did better than others, but overall the results
were quite poor. "Although overall security procedures improved the
Department of Defense (DoD) recorded a failing F grade. Meanwhile the
Department of Veterans Affairs - whose loss of laptops containing
veterans' confidential data triggered a huge security breach - failed to
submit a report. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, another agency that
has trouble keeping track of its PCs, flunked."
