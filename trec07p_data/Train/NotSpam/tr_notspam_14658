<B>TONIGHT ON SHOWBIZ TONIGHT - CNN HEADLINE PRIME 11pm
ET/PT</B>

<b>A SHOWBIZ TONIGHT SPECIAL EVENT: YOUNG HOLLYWOOD'S
MELTDOWN</b>
>From Lindsay Lohan to Paris Hilton to Britney Spears, why can't
Hollywood's young stars stay out of trouble? Do their parents
share some of the blame? From rehab to jail, why is young
Hollywood so out of control? You will not want to miss this
Showbiz Tonight special event on TV's most provocative
entertainment news show!

<b>ANOTHER ANNA NICOLE SMITH BATTLE</b>
The father of Anna Nicole Smith's baby, Larry Birkhead, is
being sued --- by his former attorney! Debra Opri says she
hasn't been paid for her work – she helped Larry in his custody
fight for Dannielynn. So why does Birkhead say she owes HIM
money?

<b>DONALD TRUMP SPEAKS OUT ON ROSIE-ELISABETH FIGHT</b>
Yea, you knew The Donald couldn't keep quiet right? Showbiz
Tonight hears from Trump - and he's got plenty of
not-so-nice-things to say about ALL of the ladies of "The
View."

<b>SHOWBIZ TONIGHT QUESTION OF THE DAY:</b>
Lindsay Lohan in rehab: Are the clubs partly to blame?
