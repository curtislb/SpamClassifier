>BROOKLYN, April 26 -  Earvin "Magic" Johnson, spokesperson for Abbott
>Laboratories, voiced support for activist demands that Abbott cease its
>efforts to block generic versions of its HIV drug Kaletra in Thailand and
>other countries, at a forum sponsored by Abbott at Medgar Evers College in
>Brooklyn, New York.
>
>When confronted by a dozen activists holding signs that read, "Magic: Help
>Us Get Kaletra To Thailand" and "Abbott's Greed Kills PWAs In Thailand,"
>Johnson first responded by saying, "Let's give them a round of applause."
>When pressed about Abbott's actions, he stated, "I'm on it.  I'm talking to
>Abbott about it."
>
>ACTUP/NY was participating in a Global Day of Action condemning Abbott
>Laboratories for their recent move in Thailand to pull seven new
>medications from the country in retaliation to the Thai government's lawful
>attempts to secure access to affordable generic medicines for its citizens.
>  AIDS activists in Thailand have called for this day of action which
>coincides with Abbott Laboratories April 27 shareholder meeting in Chicago.
>  Dozens of related protests will be occurring in several countries
>throughout the world calling on Abbott to stop threatening the public
>health of Thailand.
>
>"While Magic Johnson enjoys easy access to Abbott's lifesaving medications,
>countless others in need of HIV treatment across the globe are left out by
>Abbott's unfair practices of setting overly expensive prices and blocking
>legal generic production," stated Johnny Guaylupo of ACTUP/NY.
>
>"Abbott has really exposed the depths of their greed this time as they
>attempt to protect their profits by resorting to blackmail that puts Thai
>lives in the balance.  We need Magic to take a stand against his sponsor's
>abusive practices," said Amanda Lugg of ACTUP/NY.
>
>"Magic Johnson was known for his gutsy play on the basketball court, but
>where is that courage and leadership now as people with AIDS in Thailand
>and around the world are being denied access to the Abbott medication he
>endorses?" remarked long-time ACTUP/NY member Ken Bing.
