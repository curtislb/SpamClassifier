5:37 PM, 6/16/07, Update: Two more space station computers revived=20

Hoping for the best, space station commander Fyodor Yurchikhin and flight e=
ngineer Oleg Kotov hot wired two computers aboard the international space s=
tation today that engineers had feared were victims of fatal power supply f=
ailures. To everyone's delight, the machines promptly booted up and appeare=
d to be running normally, two more successes in an improbable recovery from=
 crippling computer crashes last week.

Two of the three computers making up the Russian segment's guidance, naviga=
tion and control computers, along with two of three central control compute=
rs, were successfully revived Friday when Yurchikhin and Kotov used jumper =
cables to bypass suspect surge protectors in secondary power supply circuit=
s.

The redundant so-called soft switches were designed to shut off power to th=
eir respective computers in the event of surges or spikes in the incoming e=
lectricity. Engineers now believe the installation of a new solar power tru=
ss last Monday triggered a subtle change in the station's power grid that s=
omehow caused the secondary power supply switches to respond, preventing th=
eir computers from booting up.

Russian engineers believed four of the six primary computers were healthy a=
nd victims of the overly sensitive switches. When the switches were bypasse=
d Friday, the four computers, two in each system, booted up normally. After=
 a thorough checkout, one machine in each chain was put back in control of =
critical station functions.

Russian engineers believed the other two computers were victims of power su=
pply hardware failures and no attempt was made to start them on Friday. But=
 today, Yurchikhin and Kotov installed jumper cables on the off chance the =
computers were, in fact, healthy and both started up normally.

"Overnight, our Russian colleagues conferred with us and confirmed that, in=
 fact, all six computers are working," said Mike Suffredini, space station =
program manager at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. "In fact, with the =
modification they did on the four I told you about last night, they did tha=
t modification on those last two, they brought all six computers up and con=
firmed they were all operating nominally. Then they went back down to a fou=
r-computer set again and continued to check out the computers.

"Currently, they have all six computers up while we do some additional trou=
bleshooting to understand the environment and how it might affect the compu=
ters."

In the meantime, the Russians have decided to leave one computer in each sy=
stem on standby to serve as an operational backup should any other problems=
 crop up.

The bottom line, Suffredini said, is that "it appears to everyone the comma=
nd-and-control-type computers are functioning just fine. In addition to tha=
t, we're doing our planning to test the attitude control system. Once we ha=
ve confirmed the attitude control system can work, that will confirm not on=
ly that the guidance, navigation and control set of computers is working bu=
t also that the guidance, navigation and control computers can talk to the =
command-and-control computers. ... So when that test is complete, we will c=
onsider that the computers are up and healthy. At that point, we will confe=
r with our shuttle colleagues on a departure date."

Atlantis astronauts Pat Forrester and Steve Swanson plan to stage a six-and=
-a-half-hour spacewalk Sunday to finish the activation of a powerful rotary=
 joint designed to slowly turn the newly installed S4 solar arrays to keep =
them roughly face-on to the sun. A variety of other station assembly get-ah=
ead tasks are planned as well.

If all goes well, the astronauts will seal hatches between the station and =
the shuttle on Monday and undock Tuesday for a return to Earth next Thursda=
y.

"So things are looking up very well," Suffredini said. "If all goes accordi=
ng to plan and the checkout goes well, we will transfer as much oxygen as o=
ur shuttle colleagues can afford to give us and then we will ... close the =
hatch Monday evening and have the shuttle depart on Tuesday."

Engineers still don't know what changed in the space station's electrical s=
ystem that might have affected the operation of the secondary power supply =
surge protectors. Suffredini said attention now is focusing on the electric=
ally charged plasma environment the station flies through and how that elec=
trical environment changes as the lab complex grows.

"We've had a lot of discussions with our Russian colleagues, who seem to co=
ncur with our assessment that this is probably due to this potential, the p=
lasma environment we fly through, that as the station gets bigger this pote=
ntial will continue to grow," Suffredini said. "We've been collecting a lot=
 of data, we have instruments that measure this potential. The Russians are=
 very interested in that data. They have noted some changes in their system=
s as we have grown. ... I think we're going to find there's some sensitivit=
y to the noise that is created as we change the space station."
