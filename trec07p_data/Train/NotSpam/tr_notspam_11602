						<div class=3D"GreyHeading">ALAN SHEARER ON THE FA CUP FINAL</div>
						<div>Saturday sees the FA Cup final return to Wembley after a seven-y=
ear absence for what will be a very special day.
<br>

<br>
I had the honour of a sneak preview of the stadium about a month ago and if=
 I had to sum up it up in one word I'd simply say, fantastic.
<br>

<br>
It really is very impressive. The spirit of the old Wembley remains, but th=
e FA have delivered a brand new sparkling stadium of which we can all be pr=
oud.
<br>

<br>
Was it worth the wait? Well I think we would all have liked to have seen it=
 delivered sooner, but I've no doubt everyone will be mightily impressed wi=
th it.
<br>

<br>
And what better way to celebrate than with the best two teams in the countr=
y slugging it out?
<br>

<br>
All week I've been asked to predict the outcome of the final, but this is a=
 game that's just too close to call - you might as well flip a coin.
<br>

<br>
Manchester United had the upper hand in the Premiership and will probably g=
o into the match in better mental shape than Chelsea, but whether that will=
 be enough to win the Cup I don't know.
<br>

<br>
Chelsea will feel they have a point to prove, and are a very talented and r=
esilient side.
<br>

<br>
The FA Cup is the only domestic trophy Jose Mourinho hasn't won at Chelsea,=
 and he's not a man who accepts failure.
<br>

<br>
Big games bring out the best in big players, and there will be plenty of th=
ose on show on Saturday - Drogba, Rooney, Terry, Ferdinand, Scholes, Lampar=
d.
<br>

<br>
But I have to reserve special praise for Manchester United's Cristiano Rona=
ldo.
<br>

<br>
There's no doubt this has been the Portuguese winger's season. He's been br=
illiant.
<br>

<br>
To perform the way he has in the face of so much criticism after the World =
Cup is very impressive and he thoroughly deserves his player of the year aw=
ards.
<br>

<br>
Enjoy the Cup final,
<br>

<br>
Alan
<br>

<br>
<b>Alan Shearer was an FA Cup finalist with Newcastle in 1998 and 1999. He =
will be a guest in the Match of the Day studio at Wembley on Saturday.</b><=
