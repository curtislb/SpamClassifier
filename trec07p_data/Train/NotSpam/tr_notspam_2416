This turns out not to be quite correct.

If the two distributions differ only by a location shift then the 
hypothesis that the shift is zero is equivalent to the medians being the 
same (or the means, or the 3.14159th percentile), and the Mann-Whitney U 
test will test this hypothesis. Otherwise the Mann-Whitney U test does not 
test for equal medians.

The assumption that the distributions are continuous is for convenience -- 
it makes the distribution of the test statistic easier to calculate and 
otherwise R uses a approximation.  The assumption of a location shift is 
critical -- otherwise it is easy to construct three data sets x,y,z so 
that the Mann-Whitney U test thinks x is larger than y, y is larger than z 
and z is larger than x (Google for Efron Dice). That is, the Mann-Whitney 
U test cannot be a test for any location statistic.

There actually is an exact test for the median that does not assume a 
location shift:  dichotomize your data at the pooled median to get a 2x2 
table of above/below median by group, and do Fisher's exact test on the 
table.  This is almost never useful (because it doesn't come with an 
interval estimate), but is interesting because it (and the generalizations 
to other quantiles) is the only exactly distribution-free location test 
that does not have the 'non-transitivity' problem of the Mann-Whitney U 
test.  I believe this median test is attributed to Mood, but I have not 
seen the primary source.
