This sounds great, thank you.

This is encouraging, because a lot of the search results said otherwise. Good to know that things have improved.

I would rather use uswsusp and not patch the kernel.

Right now I have the following two packages installed: hibernate and uswsusp. The hibernate package description says that it supports both suspend2 and /sys/power/state. Am I correct to assume that uswsusp uses neither? I want to make sure "just in case" and because by default the laptop task installs hibernate. The last thing I need is a corrupt partition.

Thank you for the generous replies. They helped a lot!
