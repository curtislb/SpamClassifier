Well, I saw some patches [1] floating by which did remove 
PObj_bufstart_external_FLAG. This flag was needed to sync the malloc-based 
allocators with parrots (and COWs) understanding of a 'not owned' / external 
buffer/string memory resource. COWed strings are not external to the 
malloc-based GCs, they just have an increased ref-count.

I was never able to fix string allocation and COW in such a way that this flag 
would be obsolete with GC_IS_MALLOC.

[1] well it seems ;) that I've committed r10582 but this patch obviously 
ignroed the GC_IS_MALLOC-cases. While having different allocators is nice, 
it's really hard to test & sync them with the default one.
