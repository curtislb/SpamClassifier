It seems that PhRMA was able to insert language in the Prescription Drug
User Fee Amendments of 2007 (S.1082, the Food and Drug Administration
Revitalization Act) critical of other countries' compulsory licensing
efforts. PDUFA is the system by which drug company user fees pay a
substantial portion of the Food and Drug Administration budget; the key
debates around the bill relate to drug safety concerns.

Thailand, Brazil and other countries' efforts to improve access to
medicines is not directly related to the substance of the bill, but
PhRMA evidently was able to get language inserted on this topic
nonetheless. There's a good chance that many or most Senate offices had
no idea that this language was included in the bill.

Hopefully members of the House of Representatives, alerted to the
presence of this language in the Senate bill, will insist that it be
removed.

The relevant text follows below. To see the full bill text, go to:

SEC. 516. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING CERTAIN PATENT INFRINGEMENTS.

       (a) Findings- The Senate makes the following findings:

             (1) Innovation in developing life-saving prescription drugs
saves millions of lives around the world each year.

             (2) The responsible protection of intellectual property is
vital to the continued development of new and life-saving drugs and
future growth of the United States economy.

             (3) In order to maintain the global competitiveness of the
United States, the United States Trade Representative's Office of
Intellectual Property and Innovation develops and implements trade
policy in support of vital American innovations, including innovation in
the pharmaceutical and medical technology industries.

             (4) The United States Trade Representative also provides
trade policy leadership and expertise across the full range of
interagency initiatives to enhance protection and enforcement of
intellectual property rights.

             (5) Strong and fair intellectual property protection,
including patent, copyright, trademark, and data protection plays an
integral role in fostering economic growth and development and ensuring
patient access to the most effective medicines around the world.

             (6) There are concerns that certain countries have engaged
in unfair price manipulation and abuse of compulsory licensing.
Americans bear the majority of research and development costs for the
world, which could undermine the value of existing United States
pharmaceutical patents and could impede access to important therapies.

             (7) There is a growing global threat of counterfeit
medicines and increased need for the United States Trade Representative
and other United States agencies to use available trade policy measures
to strengthen laws and enforcement abroad to prevent harm to United
States patients and patients around the world.

       (b) Sense of the Senate- It is the sense of the Senate that--

             (1) the United States Trade Representative should use all
the tools at the disposal of the Trade Representative to address
violations and other concerns with intellectual property, including
through--

                   (A) bilateral engagement with United States trading
partners;

                   (B) transparency and balance of the annual `Special
301' review and reviews of compliance with the intellectual property
requirements of countries with respect to which the United States grants
trade preferences;

                   (C) negotiation of responsible and fair intellectual
property provisions as part of bilateral and regional trade agreements; and

                   (D) multilateral engagement through the World Trade
Organization (WTO); and

             (2) the United States Trade Representative should develop
and submit to Congress a strategic plan to address the problem of
countries that infringe upon American pharmaceutical intellectual
property rights and the problem of countries that engage in price
manipulation.
