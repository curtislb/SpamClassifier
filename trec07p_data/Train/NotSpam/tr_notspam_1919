Hello,

I wrote a simple socket server which get the listen socket like below,

my $socket = IO::Socket::INET->new(
                                           LocalAddr => xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx,
                                           LocalPort => 1111,
                                           Listen    => SOMAXCONN,
                                           Proto     => 'tcp',
                                           Reuse     => 1,
                                           Timeout   => 30,
                                         );

This socket server was binding on port 1111 and prepare to accept the
connections from clients,with 30 seconds timeout.
Then I telnet to this socket server from another host,

$ telnet xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 1111

After telneted in,I didn't do anything,just waited for the server to
exit due to the timeout.But even I wait for many minutes,the socket
server seems didn't drop me and I'm still kept the telnet connection.

Why the timeout seems not useful?Maybe I'm wrong for this concept?Thanks.
