bulled writes "NPR ran a story this morning about [0]the comeback of
vinyl. It seems that sales of new vinyl records are up about 10%; sales
will approach a million this year (as against half a billion for CDs).
NPR mentioned the popularity of a turntable with a USB interface — they
didn't specify the brand; could be [1]this one, or [2]this — and
speculated on other possible reasons for the resurgence. They mentioned
sound quality and lack of DRM as possible causes. Sound quality can and
will be debated, but DRM rates a resounding 'Duh.'"

Station writes "The Copyright Royalty Board [0]has rejected a request to
reconsider its March [1]decision to impose an onerous royalty schedule on
Internet radio broadcasters. '"None of the moving parties have [sic] made
a sufficient showing of new evidence or clear error or manifest injustice
that would warrant rehearing," wrote the CRB in its decision.' The
recording industry and its royalty collection organization SoundExchange
are jubilant over the ruling. '"Our artists and labels look forward to
working with the Internet radio industry — large and small, commercial
and noncommercial — so that together we can ensure it succeeds as a place
where great music is available to music lovers of all genres," said
SoundExchange head Simson in a statement. Noble words, but after today's
ruling — which will take effect on May 15 unless the US Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit agrees to hear an appeal — there
probably won't be much of an Internet radio industry left for
SoundExchange to work with.'"

An anonymous reader writes "Gravity Probe B uses four ultra-precise
gyroscopes to [0]measure two effects of Einstein's general relativity
theory — the geodetic effect and frame dragging. According to the
mission's principal investigator, the data from Gravity Probe B's
gyroscopes confirm the Einstein theory's value for the geodetic effect to
better than 1%. In a common analogy, the geodetic effect is similar to
the shape of the dip created when the ball is placed on to a rubber
sheet. If the ball is then rotated, it will start to drag the rubber
sheet around with it. In a similar way, the Earth drags local space and
time around with it — ever so slightly — as it rotates. Over time, these
effects cause the angle of spin of the satellite's gyroscopes to shift by
tiny amounts." The investigators will be doing further data analysis over
the coming months and expect to release final results late this year.

that you'll be awake enough not to go back to sleep by the time you find

you can buy from [3]the inventor's site for $50.

days in lockup until the authorities realized that their caller-id log
was off an hour because of the new Daylight Savings Time rules and that
Cody had only called one hour prior to the actual bomb threat. Perhaps it
took so long because of the principal's Catch-22 attitude about Cody's
guilt — she said, 'Well, why should we believe you? You're a criminal.
Criminals lie all the time.'"

Magnifico writes "The New York times is running an article about a push

Science courses. The story, 'Computer Science Takes Steps to Bring Women

'Women received about 38 percent of the computer science bachelor's
degrees awarded in the United States in 1985, the peak year, but in 2003,
the figure was only about 28 percent, according to the National Science
Foundation.' One of the largest barriers to recruiting women to the field
is the nerd factor. To attract women students to the CS field, 'Moving
emphasis away from programming proficiency was a key to the success of
programs Dr. Blum and her colleagues at Carnegie Mellon instituted to
draw more women into computer science.' Changes at CMU increased women
students in the CS program from 8 percent to nearly 40 percent."

| Microsoft's 'Men in Black' Kill Florida Open Standards Legislation |

+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

A NewsForge article was handed to us talking about pressure Microsoft
recently brought to bear on a piece of Florida legislation. A few short
paragraphs in Senate bill 1974 added by Rep. Ed Homan discussed the need
for open data formats, but [0]Microsoft's men in black responded by
pressuring legislators and staff employees about the bill's language. "A
legislative staff employee who would lose his job if he were quoted here
by name said, 'By the time those lobbyists were done talking, it sounded
like ODF (Open Document Format, the free and open format used by
OpenOffice.org and other free software) was proprietary and the Microsoft
format was the open and free one.' Two other legislative employees (who
must also remain anonymous) told Linux.com that the Microsoft lobbyists
implied that elected representatives who voted against Microsoft's
interests might have a little more trouble raising campaign funds than
they would if they helped the IT giant achieve its Florida goals. Note
that lobbyists for IBM, Sun Microsystems, and Novell -- the only three
companies with a major interest in open source who have registered
lobbyists in Florida -- did not weigh in on this matter." Linux.com and
Slashdot are both owned by OSTG.

[0]Frosty Piss writes "The governor of Washington is scheduled to sign
legislation today to [1]ban flame retardants called PBDEs in furniture,
televisions, and computers in the state. This is despite the more than
$220,000 the chemical industry has spent since 2005 to defeat the
legislation. At a time when the federal government is largely ineffectual
in regulating long-used but potentially dangerous industrial chemicals,
the Washington ban could be the beginning of the end for PBDEs across the
nation. 'The industry that makes deca and PBDEs is freaking out because
they lost so severely in Washington state and other states will follow,'
said a spokeswoman for the Washington Toxics Coalition. 'It really is a
message from Washington state and policymakers that we won't accept
chemicals that build up in our bodies and our children.'"

MicroAdobe writes "Microsoft has noticed that some of the coolest sites
on the Web, YouTube and MySpace included, get much of their flash from
Flash and other design programs sold by Adobe. But as [0]Microsoft gets
ready to ship its own line of tools for designers and Web developers, the
company is finding it must also defend against Adobe on its home turf,
the desktop. At the same time, the line between Internet and desktop
programs is blurring, and both companies see an opportunity to capture
new business." The article focuses on the competition and doesn't even
mention that Adobe's CEO called Microsoft a [1]$50 billion monopolist.

for Firefox that resolves the problems users of the older version were
experiencing. According to the company's [1]Port 25 blog, it's backwards
compatible with Windows Media Player 6.4. The plugin is for Windows XP
and Vista only, but if you have to watch WMV video at least it's less
likely to crash your browser."

jas_public writes "Since the human and chimp families split about 6
million years ago, [0]chimpanzee genes seem to have evolved more than
human genes. The results, detailed in the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences, go against the conventional wisdom that humans are
the result of a high degree of genetic selection, evidenced by our
relatively large brains, cognitive abilities, and bipedalism. The
researchers found that 'substantially more genes in chimps evolved in
ways that were beneficial than was the case with human genes.'"

A number of readers (some from the audience at Web 2.0 Expo) wrote to let
us know that [0]Google is adding presentations to their Docs and
Spreadsheets package. With the announcement the company revealed that
they have purchased [1]Tonic Systems to help with the new presentation
software. It's expected to be ready by summer. Google's CEO Eric Schmidt
was [2]asked if Docs and Spreadsheets will compete with MS Office, and he
said, "We don't think so. It doesn't have all the functionality, nor is
it intended to have the functionality of products like Microsoft Office."
