The type/format of work you mean.  Do not specify work format, you don't
get that element.

I don't know what you're referring to.  CC doesn't run a registration
service.

You're mistaken as to what valid HTML or XHTML allow.  CC used to hand
out RDF/XML *embedded in a HTML comment*.

See http://wiki.creativecommons.org/RDFa for background on what we're
using now.  It doesn't validate now, but is otherwise the least bad
option available.
