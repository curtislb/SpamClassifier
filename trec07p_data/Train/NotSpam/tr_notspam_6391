Thailand

[snip]

...In addition to these longstanding concerns with deficient IPR
protection in Thailand, in late 2006 and early 2007, there were further
indications of a weakening of respect for patents, as the Thai
Government announced decisions to issue compulsory licenses for several
patented pharmaceutical products. While the United States acknowledges a
country’s ability to issue such licenses in accordance with WTO rules,
the lack of transparency and due process exhibited in Thailand
represents a serious concern. These actions have compounded previously
expressed concerns such as delay in the granting of patents and weak
protection against unfair commercial use for data generated to obtain
marketing approval.
