Dear Donny,

I don't normally get drawn into these kinds of things, but for the sake of
argument, you should probably hear these things.  Let's address your
cookie-cutter "talking points," one by one.

1) You stated "I will never agree that carbon dioxide is pollution. In
fact, without carbon dioxide, there's no photosynthesis and we all die."
Of course, we all need copper in our bodies, or we would die.  However,
too much copper will kill you.  Too much copper in the soil, trouble  We
all need water in our bodies, or we would die.  However, too much water
can kill you (water intoxication, check it out, or, hey, drowning).
There's all kinds of things that are necessary in the proper balance, or
terrible things result.  Too much of a good thing.  Hell, too much
nitrogen wouldn't be good, and all of the protein in your body contains
it.

Of course, you already know that.  You're just using a bad analogy to
support your argument.  If you wish to be intellectually honest, you may
NEVER use that as a talking point, ever again, in any discussion, with
anyone.

2) Global Cooling - Your statement was that "not a single scientist" was
able to answer "Why did we have global cooling through the 1950s, 1960s
and half of the 1970s?"  This is correct, in so far as a single scientist
did not answer it.  More accurately, several scientists HAVE answered it.

Let's have a quick tour of global cooling, shall we?  Global cooling, that
brief cooldown around the 70's, back when we first started keeping really
accurate data, was mostly due to the release of sulfate aerosols, which we
have since ceased to do.  Sulfate aerosols have a large cooling effect.
Since you like Wikipedia, check out
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribution_of_recent_climate_change#Attribution_of_20th_century_climate_change.
 Notice the light purple line in the chart, for the negative contribution
of sulfate emissions.  You can see that the modeled temperatures follow
the observed ones pretty well - that means that our science is getting
more accurate.  The Global Cooling article on Wikipedia has a heck of a
lot of info.  Check it out.

You have now been informed on this topic, since your stance was that no
scientist has ever answered it before.  They have.  If you wish to be
intellectually honest, you may NEVER use that as a talking point, ever
again, in any discussion, with anyone.

3 & 4) Optimum recommendations of temperature and carbon dioxide levels.
Aside from medical science, scientists do not make "optimum
recommendations."  They made predictions based on past data and explain
observations.  The question might be better phrased as "optimum
recommendations in order to do ... what?"  Well, if you want a lot of
storms and some new coastlines, yeah, let's let it cook for a while
longer.  The dinosaurs liked it nice and toasty, too.  We can look at
historical data, obtained from as many sources as we can get, and make
some fairly educated calculations.  Clearly, nobody wants to jack up the
surface albedo so high that we get another little ice age.

Science isn't going to answer the question for you, "How hot do you like
your room?"  You'll have to figure that out for yourself, based on the
consequences.  Scientists haven't determined a favorite color, either.

It boils down to something very simple ... we have precisely one (1)
planet upon which we may experiment.  We don't get another one if we screw
it up (unless you believe in The Rapture).  This leads me, personally, to
err on the side of caution.  We are already powerful enough to make
species go extinct, make new species, divert entire rivers for our
transportation needs, poison areas and make them uninhabitable, turn
deserts into oases, and so forth.  We have those abilities.  It's not a
stretch to think we could affect the atmosphere, too.

Now, you probably will keep using that global cooling thing, and the bit
about needing carbon dioxide, but, since I have called you on it, just
remember that you now know better, every time you use it.

Of course, I have a sneaking suspicion that, as someone from
jesusanswers.com, you figure that the Second Coming will just take care of
any messes people make.
