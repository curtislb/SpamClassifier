ourage cyber-bullies</b></a>.

Meanwhile, web pioneer Tim O'Reilly has drawn up a <b><a href=3D"http://new=

<br>

<br>
In tonight's programme, we'll attempt to redress some of the negative press=
 new technology has been getting.  We'll look at some of the creative effor=
ts the technology has been unleashing, and the increasing craze on sites su=
ch as YouTube for posting re-enactments of famous scenes from films.
<br>

<br>
To whet your appetite, below is a YouTube link to one man's one-man Goodfel=
las cyber-homage.  Here's your opportunity to get into a spot of afternoon =
wilfing, and we'd like to point out that the clip contains strong language =
from the outset.
