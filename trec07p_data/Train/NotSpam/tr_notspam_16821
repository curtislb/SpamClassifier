So, to be clear: you would claim that if one says 'this house is made using
these materials' then the tools are not included in 'materials'?

Would you expect an art *materials* catalogue to include easels, brushes,
knives and other things used to make the art but not included in it?

Here are the top three results of a web search for art materials:

I don't see the relevance of stating the obvious here.

But they are used as materials IMO.  Returning to the house-building
example, I don't see hammers as consumed entirely by my construction,
so I wouldn't expect to see them on my bill of materials, but they are
materials used in the construction, so I'd expect them to be available
from a building materials supplier.

Please, get over this.  I'm not baiting anyone with any scarecrow.
I'm trying to understand how it is possible to claim that compilers
don't fit the meaning of materials there - in fact, unlike most hammers,
most compilers even leave part of themselves in the construction - and
whether this is based on a misunderstanding like the one posted about
copyleft and upstream contributions recently.
