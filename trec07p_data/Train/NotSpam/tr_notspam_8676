1.  Can you say a bit more about the context in which you ran this  
test?  'make test'?  'prove t/postconfigure/*.t'?  In particular, did  
you run it *before* running Configure.pl or *afterwards*?

2.  If you do 'make clean', then 'svn update', then re-run the test,  
do you still get the error?

3.  This test was tricky, and, in the course of developing it, I got  
this same error several times.  The trickiness arises from the fact  
that the underlying code being tested, lib/Parrot/Revision.pm, has  
the name of a file in the Parrot distribution hard-coded into its  
major subroutine:

sub __get_revision {
     return 0 unless ( -e 'DEVELOPING' );
     ...
}

In my never-ending quest for complete code coverage, I had to devise  
a way to test both branches in that return statement, i.e., test  
under circumstances in which 'DEVELOPING' both does and -- here's the  
tricky part -- does not exist.  The only way I could do the latter  
was to copy the relevant files into a temporary directory and, for  
certain tests, not copy 'DEVELOPING' along with them.  It's very  
hackish, but it did enable me to get to full coverage of that statement.

The fact that this test is in 't/postconfigure/' means that it is  
meant to be run only *after* Configure.pl has executed (whether that  
be immediately pre-make or as part of 'make test'.  A SKIP block  
should come into play if you run this test *before* Configure.pl.

Let me know what further results you get.  Thank you very much.
