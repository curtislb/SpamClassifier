CSV is a horrible format.  Far too unreliable,  we have exported CSV
from excel that imported differently into excel.

Is there another option,  eg connecting to Outlook via a remote
connection?

Is there another format available?

I doubt a simple regex will do it if the CSV modules do not work.

What data do you have problems with?  Without samples there is nothing
we can do.
