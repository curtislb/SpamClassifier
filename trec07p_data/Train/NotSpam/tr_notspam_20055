As you said in your comment this will be a great step backwards -- I
was able to install gentoo on a laptop without assistance because of
speakup being built in and now that ubuntu has dropped it, this would
be no good.  How about just saying its not selectable for spark and
seeing if we can get it to work for 2.6.22 elsewhere which I am sure
Kirk is working on?  

The user space idea may be something worth considering as we no longer
get the boot messages we used to get, however this would be a much
bigger change.  Kirk is working on a git patch set which may help, but
its broke right now.
