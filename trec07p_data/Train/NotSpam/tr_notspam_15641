I agree, personally, as I think I have said on this list recently, I would 
like to see CDs start comming in the format that LPs came in in my younger 
days.

Say the complete "Goodby Yellow Brick Road" package, full LP size, just with 
CDs in place (or even as well as) LPs in the purchase.

I agree with the conflation problem. Also there is the terminology problem. It 
is not theft or piracy, it is copyright violations if anything. Loaded words 
and all. File sharing happens to involve copyright violations at times but 
can, and often does, happen without copyright violations.

I think the point that was being made is that if we paid up front for 
production of music, and allowed free copying (and I would add, make the 
music Free) then that copying would not deprive the artists of income. They 
would have already been paid for making the music before the copying started.
