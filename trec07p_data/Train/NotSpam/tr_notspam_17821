Hello list, I am not quite sure if this is the place for this sort of 
question, but, beeing that it had to do with speakup, figured I would 
ask and see what I get. First of all, what are the biggest 
differences between the bsd systems such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, 
and the linux distros, gentoo, debian, etc? From researching and 
reading it seems that there are people that either love or hate one 
or the other. From a security standpoint, what is more secure? Also, 
if bsd is like linux, as it seems to be, could speakup ever be made 
to work with it? Once again, I hope this is not off topic, but, 
beeing that there are loads of people who understand these things 
better than I do, I figured I would ask.
