hello list,
Could I possibly bauther someone to tell me how to do this?
I have little to no experience with ssh scripting at all.
My idea is this:
I want to take the ip addresses from /etc/hosts.deny and put them in a file, or just do the following:
iptables -A INPUT -s x.x.x.x -j DROP
where x.x.x.x would be the IP found in the hosts.deny file.
I have a or will have a script in init.d that will add all the rules to iptables when it starts, so the script can be executed.
Any help with this would be appriciated.
Thanks,
~~TheCreator~~
