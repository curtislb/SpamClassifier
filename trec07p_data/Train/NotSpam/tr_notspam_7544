						<div class=3D"GreyHeading">HAZEL IRVINE ON THE WORLD SNOOKER</div>
						<div>Stephen Maguire and John Higgins are embroiled in a fascinating =
all-Scottish semi-final at the World Snooker Championship.
<br>

<br>
Maguire's career has taken a backward step after he burst onto the scene by=
 winning the UK Championship in 2004.
<br>

<br>
But he really has lived up to his "On-fire Maguire" moniker at the Crucible=
 and is producing some fearsome snooker.=20
<br>

<br>
His concentration and determination is so fierce you can almost feel it.
<br>

<br>
He is a real animal at the table and is so menacing you simply can't take y=
our eyes off him.
<br>

<br>
Anyone who knocks Ronnie O'Sullivan out must be bang in form and that certa=
inly applies to Higgins.
<br>

<br>
He has arguably come through the toughest section of the draw and is playin=
g fantastically well.
<br>

<br>
I always think it's surprising that he has never added to the solitary worl=
d title he won way back in 1998, but perhaps this year we will see him lift=
 the trophy again.
<br>

<br>
The winner of that tie will take on either former world champion Shaun Murp=
hy or the unheralded Mark Selby.
<br>

<br>
Selby has been nicknamed "the Hoover" by my colleagues Steve Davis and John=
 Parrott for his ability to vacuum up every opportunity he gets at the tabl=
e.
<br>

<br>
He is also known as "the Jester from Leicester" for his sense of humour, bu=
t we haven't seen any sign of that from him over the past two weeks.
<br>

<br>
He has had his game face on, he's got his head down and shown no fear to an=
y of his opponents.
<br>

<br>
Murphy produced one of the greatest comebacks in Crucible history in defeat=
ing Matthew Stevens in the quarter-finals.
<br>

<br>
When you battle back like he did from 11-5 down to win you feel invincible,=
 so he is going to take some stopping.
<br>

<br>
Enjoy the action,
<br>

<br>
Hazel
<br>
