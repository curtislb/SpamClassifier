Heh, confirmed; I didn't realize that /proc/$pid/cmdline on Linux would
return a full buffer rather than a set of null-terminated strings.  This
seems to be the case for /proc/$pid/environ as well, so both of these
measures are circumventable, at least on Linux 2.6.

Are you inclined to apply it anyway, or should we just drop it?
