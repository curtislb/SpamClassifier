GOP CHALLENGE TO BUSH IRAQ POLICY FAILS IN SENATE
Senate republican made their strongest challenge yet to President Bush’s Iraq policy with a proposal that would restrict U.S. aid for Iraq if Baghdad failed to implement certain political and security reforms. But the measure fell eight votes short of the 60 needed to move forward. Ahead of the vote, a top GOP leadership aide described the amendment as a “pressure valve” to allow senators to vent their concerns about the lack of progress in Iraq. It marks the first time Senate Republican leaders allowed a vote on a measure sponsored by one of their members to impose conditions on the president’s conduct of the war. “There's a lot of sentiment in our conference that you can't force order and democracy on people who don't want it,” the aide said, adding that the lack of progress “is having an impact on us.” The amendment was sponsored by Sens. John Warner of Virginia and Susan Collins of Maine, with the help of several mostly moderate Republicans. It would have required Presid!
 ent Bush to send a progress report to Congress in both July and September 2008. The senate also rejected a Democratic proposal to cut off combat funding after March 2008.

SEN. HAGEL CALL FOR GONZALES RESIGNATION
Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska joined calls for Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to resign today, saying Gonzales has “lost the moral authority to lead.” James Comey, the No. 2 official at the Justice Department until 2005, testified yesterday that Gonzales tried to get his ailing predecessor, John Ashcroft, to sign off on the administration's program for surveillance without warrants from his hospital bed after Comey raised questions about the program. Comey told the Senate Judiciary Committee that Gonzales, then White House counsel, and former White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card tried “to take advantage of a very sick man” by going to Ashcroft's hospital room. In a written statement today, Hagel said the “honesty and capability” of the attorney general must be unquestioned.  “Attorney General Gonzales can no longer meet this standard,” Hagel said. “He has failed this country. He has lost the moral authority to lead.” White House Press Secretary Tony Snow disag!
 reed with Hagel's assessment of the attorney general and said Gonzales retains President Bush's support. Hagel is a possible Republican presidential contender. He has been increasingly estranged from the Bush administration, even raising the prospect of President Bush's impeachment over the war in Iraq. Several congressional Democrats and a handful of Republicans already have called on Gonzales to quit over the firings of at least eight U.S. attorneys last year. The Justice Department's initial description of the firings as “performance-related” sparked a furor from the fired lawyers, who responded by raising allegations of political influence on pending cases.

U.S. OFFERS REWARD FOR SOLDIERS MISSING IN IRAQ
The U.S. military is offering a $200,000 reward for any information about the location of three missing American soldiers, or who was involved in their possible abduction, a senior U.S. military official at the Pentagon tells CNN. The military is also dropping approximately 150,000 leaflets from helicopters in the region south of Baghdad where the soldiers went missing after an ambush Saturday, urging Iraqis to call a tip line with any information and informing them of the reward money, the official said. Four U.S. soldiers and an Iraqi soldier were killed in the attack. So far, the U.S. military has sifted through more than 140 tips that have led to dozens of “deliberate operations” in its massive search for the missing soldiers, Maj. Gen. William Caldwell said during a briefing on today. Thousands of U.S. and Iraqi forces are taking part in the search and have questioned more than 600 people. Of those, 11 have been detained, he said. The slain and missing U.S. soldiers wer!
 e based at Fort Drum in New York, and all seven have been identified as members of the 4th Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment of the 10th Mountain Division's Second Brigade Combat Team.

PRINCE HARRY IRAQ DEPLOYMENT NIXED
Britain’s Prince Harry will not deploy to Iraq as a troop commander because of “a number of specific threats” against him, the chief of the general staff, Sir Richard Dannatt, said today. Dannatt said he had notified Buckingham Palace and Prime Minister Tony Blair about his decision. An official for Clarence House, the residence of Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, said Prince Harry “is very disappointed that he will not be able to go to Iraq with his troop on this deployment, as he had hoped. He fully understands and accepts General Dannatt's difficult decision, and remains committed to his Army career. Prince Harry's thoughts are with his troop and the rest of the Battle Group in Iraq.” Today's announcement reverses a statement made in February by the British Ministry of Defense and the British royalty, which said that Harry, third in line to the throne, would be sent to Iraq with his regiment. “There have been a number of specific threats -- some reported and so!
 me not reported -- which relate directly to Prince Harry as an individual,” Dannatt said. “These threats expose not only him but also those around him to a degree of risk that I now deem unacceptable.”

DEADLY VIOLENCE RAGES IN GAZA
Battles between Palestinian factions in Gaza claimed more than a dozen lives today, while Hamas militants launched rockets into Israel, provoking an air strike in southern Gaza that killed four more Palestinians. More than 40 Palestinians have died since the latest round of Hamas-Fatah fighting broke out on Sunday in Gaza. In a sign of the heightening chaos, fighting in central Gaza City forced dozens journalists to take cover in Ramattan studios, a 15-story building that had come under fire, according to reporters inside. Another cease-fire was declared today, the fourth in as many days. The Palestinian government is struggling to quell the latest round of fighting, which has highlighted the weaknesses of the Hamas-Fatah unity government, formed this year in an effort to stop the previous round of infighting.
