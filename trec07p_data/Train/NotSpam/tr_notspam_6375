						<div class=3D"GreyHeading">GABBY LOGAN, HOST OF INSIDE SPORT</div>
						<div>Hello everyone,
<br>
It's an exciting day for me as tonight is the first edition of the new spor=
ts news magazine I'm presenting called INSIDE SPORT.  It's on BBC ONE at 23=
05 BST.
<br>

<br>
On tonight's show, I meet the Chelsea and England captain, John Terry. We b=
oth have twins and I was amazed as he told me about the moment his girlfrie=
nd gave birth - all I can say is "Respect" to that woman!  He also revealed=
 his love of Lionel Richie and, more seriously, what his ambitions are once=
 his playing days are over.
<br>

<br>
Also tonight, remember the three blondes in a boat who won Olympic Gold in =
Athens?  Well now they are rivals and competing against each other for the =
one place in the British sailing team for Beijing. We go to meet them and w=
itness the battle on the high seas.=20
<br>
=20
<br>
And we've also got exclusive behind-the-scenes access to the king of world =
football, Fifa boss, Sepp Blatter, and the latest on South Africa's race to=
 be ready for the 2010 World Cup.
<br>

<br>
I'll be joined by our regular panellists Steve Bunce and Des Kelly - these =
boys are not known for being shy and retiring - to debate the week's talkin=
g points. And the BBC's Sports Editor, Mihir Bose, will be with us to give =
us his inside track on sporting stories.
<br>

<br>
There's also a competition - would you like to go to the first FA Cup final=
 at Wembley? Two tickets could be yours.
<br>

<br>
So I hope you can join me tonight - don't forget I'm also back on BBC TWO n=
ext Sunday at 1230 BST - you can see the big interview again and lots more =
new stuff.
<br>

<br>
Gabby.
<br>

<br>

<br>
Gabby hosts Inside Sport on Monday 30 April, 2305 BST on BBC ONE, and secon=
d edition, 6 May, 1230 BST on BBC TWO.
