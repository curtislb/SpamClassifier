Maybe I'm just a little slow on the uptake, but I don't at all
understand the correlation between your sample input and sample
output.  Where did "A B 4" come from, and what does it mean for "2 co-
ocurrences" under doc number 1?  What is a co-occurrence? I see one
instance of "1 A", and two instances of "1 B".  How does that
translate to "2 co-ocurrences" of "A B"?

Can you explain your desired goal a little better?
