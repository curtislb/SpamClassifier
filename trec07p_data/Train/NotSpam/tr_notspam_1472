Thanks Uwe, I had hoped that there would be something off-the-shelf I
could use.  It's not a big deal, I was just trying to generate an
interesting data set for a visualisation class that I'm teaching.  The
very simple statistics that I had been extracting with tuneR (energy,
variance, pureFF, etc) don't discriminate between difference genres of
music (let alone artistcs) at all well.
