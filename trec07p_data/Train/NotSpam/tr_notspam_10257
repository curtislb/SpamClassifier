Lou Dobbs Tonight
Monday, May 14, 2007

Tonight, an Al Qaeda in Iraq splinter group claims to have
abducted three missing U.S. soldiers, and 4,000 of our troops
are now actively searching for them. We’ll bring you the latest
on this story and what we’re doing to get them back.

The New Axis of Evil: Does the American Middle Class have any
representation in any part of the federal government any more?
The Democrats took over Capitol Hill with promises about an
increase in the minimum wage and improved trade practices. But
now, in concert with the White House, they continue to do
nothing for the American worker.  The same is expected for
illegal immigration. We’ll have that story tonight.

The Senate resumes its debate on amnesty for the millions of
illegal aliens living in America. But does the legislation have
a better chance this time around? Tune in tonight to find out.


The Border Patrol Union has issued a vote of no confidence
against Border Patrol Chief David Aguilar. The union has also
filed an unfair labor practice complaint against the border
patrol chief, saying he sought to "intimidate" field agents in
an effort to discredit a "no-confidence" vote by the union's
leadership. Is this true? We’ll tell you tonight.

And we'll talk with civil rights activist Rev. Al Sharpton
about race and religious bigotry in America.

Visit http://cnn.com/loudobbstonight to read Lou’s
latest commentary on the dangerous narrowing separation of
church and state and to test your news knowledge ion our Week
in Review quiz.

Lou Dobbs lays out his manifesto to save the middle class in

Business, and Special Interest Groups Are Waging War on the
American Dream and How to Fight Back.” War on the Middle Class
is now on sale in bookstores near you and on Amazon.com and
BarnesandNoble.com.
