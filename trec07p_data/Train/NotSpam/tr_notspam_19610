Lou Dobbs Tonight
Friday June 15, 2007

Tonight, the so-called comprehensive immigration reform bill is
heading back to the Senate floor as part of the Amnesty Agenda.
But will the bill have any success the second time around, and
what’s changed since half the U.S. Senate opted against a vote
on the bill? We’ll have a full story tonight.

California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is urging Latino
immigrants to watch broadcasting in English so they can learn
the language. The Governor was speaking before the National
Convention of Hispanic Journalists in San Jose when he told the
audience Latinos should stop watching Spanish language
channels. Hispanic journalists say it’s their job to inform
members of the Hispanic community who don’t understand English.
We’ll have a full report on the language controversy.

There is growing concern over China’s military threat and the
support of rogue nations through arms sales. Major recipients
of China’s arms are Iran, Iraq, Myanmar, North Korea, Pakistan,
and Thailand. There is worry some of the weapons are finding
their way to terrorist organizations such as the Taliban in
Afghanistan, either through direct supply or transferred by
other nations such as Iran. We’ll take a look at China’s
fingerprints on weapons around the world.

Americans outraged over proposals for a North American Union
protested at our nation’s capitol today against any plans to
open America’s borders to open trade from Mexico and Canada.
We’ll have a special report on the protest tonight.

In our weekly tribute to the men and women who serve this
nation in uniform, we bring you the story of Air Force Staff
Sgt. Timothy Bishop, who had one of the most dangerous jobs in
the military. During a 48-hour battle in Afghanistan he called
in air strikes on the enemy, which saved the lives of Special
Forces troops. For his bravery, he received the Bronze Star
with valor. Tune in for his valiant story tonight.

And Lou will be joined by three of the country's best political
analysts for a recap of the week’s top stories: Ed Rollins,
former White House Political Director, Robert Zimmerman,
Democratic National Committeeman and Michael Goodwin, Pulitzer
Prize-winning columnist for the New York Daily News.

reform bill. And test your news knowledge in our Week in Review
quiz.
