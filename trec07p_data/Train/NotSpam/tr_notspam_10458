Hello Chas,

All your replies are lately posted twice, and have a strange Newsgroups:
header line.

  Newsgroups: perl.beginners,perl.beginners

For example:

Message-ID:
<58ce48dc0705140748v32e237derf46c3fc6c8d07bf6@mail.gmail.com>


A diff between the two messages (with the same Message-ID, but with
different SMTP ids) shows this:

so nz-out-0506.google.com (which has 2 IP-nrs) hands it over twice, with
exactly 10 minutes in between, which could be SMTP related.
But that still doesn't explain why the newsgroup name is twice in the
Newsgroups: header line.
