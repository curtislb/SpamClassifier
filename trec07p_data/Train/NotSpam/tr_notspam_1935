Hello,
    Unfortunately, I don't have the good fortune to have a physical serial 
port.  I used SSH for the install and the initial configuration of the 
system because of that.
    After the install, I made sure ssh started on boot, and logged into it 
again and set Alsa up.  It worked like a charm, and now I can just use 
software speech, with normal speakup review keys, as you said.
    I've yet to try running Gnome.  But if the performance from the system 
as it stands now is any indicator, I shouldn't be surprised if it worked 
very well indeed.
    I also plan to try fiddling with USB serial hardware on the VM, to see 
if I can get it to be recognized as real serial hardware.
I'll report on this as I try it.
All the best,
Zack.
