Hi,

Selling my Media PC and thought it might be of interest to
folks here due to the accessibility features.  The system
is an HTPC, meaning it is meant to live in with the TV,
Stereo etc.  It's quite small and will fit nicely into a
stereo stand measuring 14.6w x 2.1h x 12.1d inches.  It
runs fanless so can be operated completely silent depending
on whether the hard drive sleeps.  I can't hear the drive
behind the glass of my cabinet though so isn't really an
issue.  The system has good a/v connectivity, connects to
the television or AV receiver via s-video cable and rca
analogue or spdif audio for 5.1 output.  The remote
receiver connects via usb and also has little transmitter
hookups for lirc control of other AV components.  For
example: I had the machine learn my AV receiver's remote
and when the system boots up, it'll automatically switch
the amp to the appropriate AV source.  It has a 40GB hard
drive installed which can be upgraded.  I've never really
seen the need though as Media can be easily mounted and
streamed via NFS.  The onboard network is 10/100 mbit which
is enough to stream DVD images over the lan.  More info on
the hardware can be found here.
http://cgi.ebay.ca/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=200106215753

It was configured with the Via Epia sp 13000 1.3ghz option. 
Default memory was upgraded to 512mb and the cdrom was
removed altogether.  Meaning if you wipe the hard drive,
you need to do a fresh install via usb flash or my personal
choice, networked PXE.

On the software side, the system is usable by both sited
and blind people.  On bootup, it goes into the Freevo media
centre where one can play music, watch movies, listen to
web radio etc.  I've modified freevo to speak the menus
though as navigated by the remote so most things will talk,
actual menus, directory listings etc.  Dialogues do not
though but they are rarely used.  The shutdown dialogue is
one example but it isn't used, just walk up to the machine
and hit the button and it'll do a controled shutdown. 
Distribution used is Debian with access via ssh remotely.

Paid over $900cdn new, asking $550usd or $600 cdn includes
shipping for Canada or the US.  Subtract $50 if you can
pick it up in the Vancouver area.

Best,
Shane
