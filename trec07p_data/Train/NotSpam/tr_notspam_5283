						<b>LOCAL ELECTIONS</b>
<br>

<br>
Tonight we cast ahead to The Big Vote a week today - the English local elec=
tions, Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly elections, and the possible o=
utcome. How will the parties do?=20
<br>

<br>
Newsnight has commissioned some exclusive research from the UK's leading el=
ection study centre in Plymouth which offers up some shocking news for the =
politicians. We have predictions of share of the vote, seats won and lost, =
and what it would mean if it was repeated in a general election.=20
<br>

<br>
<b>TARTANOMICS</b>
<br>
=20
<br>
Ahead of the Scottish parliament elections commentators have been writing r=
eams about the possible break up of the Union - if the opinion polls are to=
 be believed it is a serious prospect - and the impact would be felt throug=
hout the UK.=20
<br>

<br>
Stephanie Flanders has been investigating tartanomics - that's tartan-omics=
 not tart-anomics. How would an independent Scotland fare? Would it be bett=
er or worse off and are the SNP's economic plans credible?
<br>
=20
<br>
<b>A LOAD OF RUBBISH?</b>
<br>

<br>
And The Great Bin Scandal is becoming one of the biggest issues in the Engl=
ish local elections. "The alternative weekly collection" is supposedly chea=
per and greener, but the government's not to keen to tell you about it ahea=
d of next Thursday's vote - so how do you feel about rubbish collection red=
uced to once a fortnight?=20
<br>

<br>
Tonight we are delighted that Talk Sport's shock jock James Wales will join=
 us live from his own show to express his outrage at the plans and debate w=
ith the Green Party for whom this move represents environmental progress.=
=20=20
<br>

<br>
Stand well back - but do watch.=20
<br>
