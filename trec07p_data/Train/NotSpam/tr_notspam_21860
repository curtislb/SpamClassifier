Vista's 'desktop search,' Google claims that [1]Vista's search has not
changed enough: 'Google said yesterday that the remedies don't go far

steveb3210 writes "It seems that what was once a 5-acre glacial lake in
the Andes has mysteriously disappeared. 'In March we patrolled the area
and everything was normal,' Juan Jose Romero from Chile's National
Forestry Corporation, Conaf, said. 'We went again in May and to our
surprise we found that [0]the lake had completely disappeared. All that
was left were chunks of ice and an enormous fissure.'" The current theory
is that an earthquake opened the ground and allowed the lake to drain.
Looks like global warming is off the hook this time around.

naught. In a display of forgiveness and bridge building on behalf of the
FSF, ZDNet reports that the final draft of the GPLv3 will close the
infamous MS-Novell loophole while [1]allowing deals made previously to
continue. From the article: 'The final, last-call GPLv3 draft bans only
future deals for what it described as tactical reasons in a 32-page
explanation of changes. That means Novell doesn't have to worry about
distributing software in SLES that's governed by the GPLv3 ... Drafting
the new license has been a fractious process, but Eben Moglen, the
Columbia University law school professor who has led much of the effort,
believes consensus is forming. That agreement is particularly important
in the open-source realm, where differing license requirements can erect
barriers between different open-source projects.'"

[0]Dekortage writes "[1]Eldest children have higher IQs than their
siblings, according to a recent study by Norwegian researchers. [2]The
study focused on men, particularly 'on teasing out the biological effects
of birth order from the effects of social status,' but indicates that the
senior boy in a family (either by being firstborn, or if an elder brother
died) has an average IQ two or three points higher than younger brothers.
As noted in the [3]New York Times coverage, 'Experts say it can be a
tipping point for some people â€” the difference between a high B average
and a low A, for instance... that could mean the difference between
admission to an elite private college and a less exclusive public one.'"

trend of fewer total and fewer high-severity vulnerabilities at the six
month mark compared to ... Windows XP," but he did not address the 15
unpatched flaws."

intelligence for the government, as saying. With BlackBerries, there is
"a problem with the protection of information," he said. Juillet's office
confirmed that he spoke to Le Monde but said he would not talk to other
reporters. Officials at the presidential Elysee Palace and the prime
minister's office were not immediately available for comment. Le Monde
said information sent from BlackBerries goes through servers in the

[0]Gary writes with a link to a Wired article about [1]a brain-machine
interface that may eventually have practical purposes. Though right now
it simply allows a user to move a train on a track by performing math in
their head, someday it may result in more serious applications. "Honda,
whose interface monitors the brain with an MRI machine like those used in
hospitals, is keen to apply the interface to intelligent, next-generation
automobiles. The technology could one day replace remote controls and
keyboards and perhaps help disabled people operate electric wheelchairs,
beds or artificial limbs. Initial uses would be helping people with
paralyzing diseases communicate even after they have lost all control of
their muscles. Since 2005, Hitachi has sold a device based on optical
topography that monitors brain activity in paralyzed patients so they can
answer simple questions - for example, by doing mental calculations to
indicate 'yes' or thinking of nothing in particular to indicate 'no.'"

so it's not just your word against the police's word,' said Brenda Jones,
executive director of the ACLU chapter. The ACLU has worked closely with

utter the word 'Linux'. They are generally not bothered about mentoring
someone on an exciting project, and they would suggest you to get settled
with Visual Basic, .NET, â€” and would prefer a 24 hour solution when it
comes to programming. So, my programming endeavors have remained limited
to writing few lines of C/C++, or Java. For last few days, I've been
googling, and trying to read how to join an existing Open Source
project." What suggestions would you pass along to someone who is willing
to join his first Open Source effort?

[0]mpawlo writes "Swedish foreign minister Carl Bildt is being
[1]investigated by a prosecutor because of his blog. In a blog post, Mr.
Bildt states that [2]some 13.000 comments are posted (Swedish link) on
his blog and that he and his staff try to erase all inappropriate
comments. However, they apparently missed a comment proposing genocide of
Palestinians. This prompted a Swedish leftist blogger to report the
conservative foreign minister's blog and the comment to the authorities.
Now a prosecutor is looking into the matter and the foreign minister will
likely be held responsible for the comments due to poor Swedish
legislation on freedom of speech relative to the Internet."

[0]greengrass sends us to coverage in The Register of the Open Source
Consortium's threatened anti-trust [1]challenge against the BBC over its
use of Windows Media format in its on-demand service, iPlayer. From the
article: "The OSC will raise a formal complaint with UK broadcast and
telecoms watchdog Ofcom next week, and has vowed to take its accusations
to the European Competition Commission if domestic regulators do not act.
The OSC compared the situation to the European Commission's prosecution
of Microsoft over its bundling of Windows Media Player with Windows."

Eta Car, a star approx 7,500 light years away from us that's [0]ready to
supernova sometime Real Soon Now." Larger versions of the Hubble-Chandra
image of Eta Car are available at [1]the Chandra site. Of course when
astronomers say it's "about to explode," they really mean it probably
exploded 6,500 to 7,500 years ago and we're awaiting the news.

Cumberland County District Attorney David Freed has [0]reversed himself
completely over the charges against Brian Kelly, [1]arrested for
wiretapping after videotaping a police stop. Now let's see if they are
good enough to compensate Kelly for the 26 hours he spent in jail and the
anguish of the cloud over his future caused by a felony arrest. From the
article: "... [DA] Freed said his decision will affect not only Brian
Kelly, 18, but also will establish a policy for police departments
countywide. 'When police are audio- and video-recording traffic stops
with notice to the subjects, similar actions by citizens, even if done in
secret, will not result in criminal charges,' Freed said yesterday. 'The
law itself might need to be revised.'"

Opera 9.5 (which has been code-named Kestrel) will be the first browser

Weekly builds should start being available in a few weeks."
