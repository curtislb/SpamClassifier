To answer the questions for 03-revision.t:

I ran Configure.pl a while ago (with several intervening runs of 'make' 
and 'make test'), ran 'svn update', 'make', and 'make test'.

I don't run Configure.pl every time I update the repository. That 
regenerates the Makefile, and so recompiles all of Parrot. I rarely need 
to go that far.

That fixes the error. Until the next time I run 'svn update' and rerun 
the test.

Could you take a step back and explain what you're testing? At first 
glance, I don't see why we would test the revision number. Just to be 
sure that Parrot::Revision got some value during the configure process?
