					<DIV CLASS=3DBlackHeading>
						FROM GAVIN ESLER
					</DIV><BR>
					Hello,<BR>
					<BR>
=09=09=09=09=09
						<DIV CLASS=3DRedHeading>
=09=09=09=09=09=09=09
						</DIV>
						Thanks to all of you who have sent in jokes about musicians - we'll g=
et to those at the end of the email. But one puzzle: why are viola players =
the butt of so many of the gags? What have they done to deserve this?=20
<br>

<br>
In tonight's programme:
<br>
=20
<br>
<b>Military Morale </b>
<br>

<br>
Our diplomatic editor Mark Urban has been hearing from serving British sold=
iers about low morale in Iraq and loss of support from some in the army for=
 the mission there.=20
<br>

<br>
One serving British Army officer has told us that the "overwhelming feeling=
" of many of his peers is that the invasion was "illegal, immoral and unwin=
nable".=20
<br>

<br>
He describes troops who feel that they are "reluctantly providing target pr=
actice for insurgents, senselessly haemorrhaging casualties and squandering=
 soldiers' lives."=20
<br>

<br>
It's a difficult story to get at - for obvious reasons. But the concerns ar=
e real.
<br>

<br>
<b>G8 and Climate Change </b>
<br>

<br>
Stephanie is in Germany for the G8 Summit. She'll be looking at what, if an=
ything can be achieved from summits like these.=20
<br>

<br>
Or is the G8 just a "meaningless photo opportunity", "unrepresentative", "b=
ig on rhetoric low on substance" as some of you have suggested on our websi=
te?=20
<br>

8.html#postcomment">CLICK HERE TO POST YOUR COMMENTS</B></A>
<br>

<br>
And our Environment analyst Roger Harrabin reports on how far Carbon Tradin=
g really will help solve the problems caused by climate change.=20
<br>

<br>
<b>Orange Prize </b>
<br>

<br>
The winner will be announced tonight - and Newsnight will be there. (Though=
 some of us continue to wonder - when Kiran Desai's magnificent novel wins =
the Booker Prize why in 2007 it continues to be necessary to have a women o=
nly literary prize.) Isn't it rather like netball compared to basketball?=
=20
<br>

<br>
<b>And finally...</b>
<br>

<br>
So many musician jokes, I don't know where to start. The ones about viola p=
layers were particularly vicious. Including:=20
<br>

<br>
How can you tell when a violist is playing out of tune?=20
<br>

<br>
The bow is moving.
<br>

<br>
But my favourite so far was this offering from an anonymous viewer:=20
<br>

<br>
"What do you call a guy who likes to hang out with musicians? A drummer."=
=20
<br>

<br>
Newsnight will be keeping perfect time at 10.30pm tonight.=20
