Minneapolis Institute of Arts buys million dollar African sculpture
By Mary Abbe, Star Tribune

Last update: May 07, 2007 - 7:57 PM

The Minneapolis Institute of Arts has bought a top-of-the-line bronze
African sculpture for an undisclosed price in excess of $1 million. 
The 400-year-old portrait-head of a king, made in what is now southern
Nigeria, came from a Paris dealer who offered it to the Minneapolis museum,
which has been seeking great objects for its already renowned collection of
African art.

"It's a very exciting acquisition," said William Griswold, the museum's
director. He declined to say how much the museum paid but said it was "in
excess of seven figures." 

Benin bronzes, as they are known, are rare and considered a high point in
pre-colonial African culture. By unusual coincidence, another Benin bronze
head from the same era will be up for auction at Sotheby's in New York on
May 17 and is expected to sell for between $1 million and $1.5 million. 

The 12-inch head, which joins three other Benin pieces owned by the museum,
was probably made between 1600 and 1650 and depicts an unidentified king, or
Oba, wearing a necklace of coral beads.

The institute recently built a $50 million addition primarily to expand its
20th century collection, and it continues to buy art across the board
including contemporary prints, photos and paintings. 

Given the extraordinary cost of 20th-century art, the museum expects it will
have to rely on gifts for many of its acquisitions in that field. 

"There are many more works by [contemporary sculptor] Jeff Koons out there
than there are Benin heads," Griswold said.

Georgetown Library Fire Aftermath
The news out of the Georgetown library fire is that the damage is not quite
as awful as was first feared. A fair portion of the historical documents
have been shipped off for freezing and preservation. 

Here, via Jerry McCoy, one of the great resources this region has for
preserving and promoting the record of our past, are some photos showing the
Peabody Room before and after the fire:
http://blog.washingtonpost.com/rawfisher/2007/05/georgetown_library_fire_bef
ore.html

And here's the branch librarian's take on the fire:
http://blog.washingtonpost.com/rawfisher/2007/05/georgetown_library_fire_bef
ore.html

And just in case anyone is thinking of suing the District for failing to
maintain its fire hydrants properly, here's a West Coast firefighter's
report on how his department used to prevent the sort of disaster we saw
here last week, when D.C. firefighters discovered that the two hydrants
closest to the Georgetown library were not functioning:
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/04/AR2007050401
650.html


We used to test each hydrant annually. The testing was done by the on duty
crews. The city and county were divided up by map page and it took several
months to complete.

We would remove each of the hydrant caps, wire brush the threads, open up
the hydrant to ensure that it worked, graphite the threading and then put
the caps back on. This took approximately ten minutes per hydrant. 

Today there is no annual hydrant testing done by the fire department. It was
decided by the city that since the water department is out every day working
on the water lines they were the appropriate city department to handle
hydrants. We do go out and put blue markers in the street to help locate
hydrants at night. In addition we clear any vegetation 3' around the
hydrant. 

When a hydrant is damaged or removed the water department lets us know and
we update our map pages and "bag" the hydrants with garbage bags and duct
tape. 

Sound like DC needs to get a better system to monitor their water system!

AUS DEM GERICHTSSAAL Im Suff dem Uhu zu Leibe
Geldstrafe f?r missgl?ckten Kunst diebstahl an Bibliothek

Es geht um einen Uhu, eine Eule aus Schmiedeeisen, vielleicht 50 bis 80
Kilogramm schwer. Der Vogel h?ngt unter den Arkaden zwischen der Bibliothek
und der ehemaligen Humboldt-Buchhandlung.

Was sich am 13. November 2006 abends gegen 19.45 Uhr mit dem Uhu abgespielt
haben soll, klang gestern wohl nicht nur in den Ohren der Richter des
Amtsgerichts bizarr. Alfried W., nach eigenem Bekunden "wohl Alkoholiker,
seit ich auf der Welt bin", soll gemeinsam mit Andreas P. versucht haben,
das st?hlerne Unget?m abzuschrauben und zu stehlen. Gegen P., der im
Krankenhaus liegt, wird in einem abgetrennten Prozess verhandelt, so dass
sich gestern nur W. wegen des versuchten gemeinschaftlichen Diebstahls auf
der Anklagebank wiederfand. Die drei als Zeugen vernommenen Polizisten
erz?hlten im Wesentlichen die gleiche Geschichte. Ein Passant habe zun?chst
auf der Langen Br?cke die Bundespolizei verst?ndigt, dass sich zwei M?nner
auf einer Leiter an dem Kunstwerk zu schaffen machten. Als die Beamten vor
Ort eintrafen, h?tten P. und W. auf der Betonkante einer Blumenrabatte
gesessen. Beide seien "stark alkoholisiert" gewesen. In der Rabatte habe
eine lange Holzleiter gelegen, der Uhu sei bereits halb abgeschraubt
gewesen. Zudem h?tte P. auf einem mit allerlei Werkzeugen gef?llten Beutel
gesessen, wohl, um ihn zu verstecken. Die Beschreibung des Passanten h?tte
auf die beiden Angeklagten gepasst.

W. n?tzten auch seine Ged?chtnisl?cken nichts. Er beteuerte, beide h?tten
dort nur gesessen in ihrem "Suff". Wie solle er denn als 90-prozentiger
Invalide auf eine Leiter steigen und eine "Eule von zwei Zentner"
abschrauben, fragte W. den Richter. Dem reichten die Indizien. Der
55-j?hrige Berliner, der schon 21-mal verurteilt wurde und mehrfach
Geldstrafen zahlte, muss abermals in die Tasche greifen: Das Gericht
verurteilte ihn zu einer Geldstrafe von 750 Euro, aufgeteilt auf 50
Tagess?tze. Es gebe "keinen Hinweis", dass jemand anderes auf der Leiter
gestanden habe. Pee

  Hunt for picture's owner

POLICE are trying to trace the owner of a painting which was stolen from 
the Huntingdon area 17 years ago.

The picture, a James Webb dating from 1878, was recently recovered in 
Norfolk after it was bought at auction for ?40 - but police records do 
not go back far enough to let them reunite it with its owner.

It was one of a number of paintings taken in a burglary in 1989 and now 
police want the owner to contact them.

Detective Constable Martin Brocklebank said: "I am appealing to anyone 
who thinks this painting may be theirs or knows the owner of the paining 
to contact me.

"Unfortunately police records do not go back to 1989 and we are 
therefore unable to trace the owner."

Det Con Brocklebank can be contacted on 0845 4564564 and information can 
also be given to Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111.

?45,000 Ringley sketch part of Lowry haul3

A SKETCH of Ringley Village by LS Lowry has been stolen in an armed robbery.

Masked raiders tied up art dealer Ivan Aird and threatened to kill his 
two-year-old daughter before making off with ten Lowry paintings and 
sketches, believed to be worth more than ?1.4 million. The scene at 
Ringley alone is worth ?45,000 Mr Aird's wife, Louise, opened the door 
of their home in Cheadle Heath, Stockport, at 7.50am last Thursday to 
what she believed was the postman, only for three men to rush in and 
overpower the couple and threaten them with a large knife as Mrs Aird 
held daughter Sabrina in her arms.

Among the paintings stolen were The Viaduct', valued at in excess of 
?700,000, The Tanker Entering the Tyne', worth between ?500,000 and 
?600,000, and the unique The Artist's Palette and Paintbrushes.' 
Detectives investigating the robbery say the offenders knew exactly what 
they were looking for.

Detective Chief Inspector Linda Reid from Stockport CID said: "The 
brutality these men showed to the Aird family was horrific. They may not 
have physically harmed them but they were left extremely shaken by the 
whole ordeal.

"This would appear to be a targeted attack by burglars who knew exactly 
what they were looking for. They must have known Mr Aird was an art 
collector and that he would have the paintings in the house. These 
paintings are extremely valuable to collectors but someone would have to 
know the right people to sell them on to."

One of the offenders is described as white, in his 30s, with a round 
face and was wearing a fluorescent jacket. Another of the men is 
described as mixed race and the third was wearing a balaclava. All three 
men spoke with local accents.

Art theft trial begins for former Olympian?s partner
 
Rene Bruemmer
The Gazette


Tuesday, May 08, 2007

The trial of former Olympic athlete Myriam Bedard's partner, Nima 
Mazhari, who is charged with the theft and possession of paintings 
valued at $100,000, began this week at the Montreal courthouse.

Mazhari, who initially defended himself in the case after complaining of 
unfair treatment at the hands of Canada's justice system, appeared in 
court Monday with legal-aid lawyer Yves Graton.

"A judge told me it's very hard even for a lawyer to present a case like 
this in front of a jury," Mazhari said in an interview today. "So even 
though we suffered this very hard situation, where we faced bureaucratic 
terrorism, where I was not trusting anybody ... we will have to try and 
have trust."

Jury selection and witness testimony is scheduled to begin next week, 
"but in court, you never know how long things will take," Mazhari said. 
This week is reserved for legal motions by the defence. The case is 
scheduled to last eight weeks.

Mazhari is accused of stealing 20 paintings between December 2001 and 
November 2003 by the late Ghitta Caiserman-Roth, with whom Mazhari 
shared a studio on St. Laurent Blvd.

Bedard and Mazhari dominated headlines last December after a Canada-wide 
warrant was issued for her arrest on charges they had fled to 
Washington, D.C., with her 11-year-old daughter in violation of a 
custody agreement with the girl's father.

Bedard and Mazrahi said they were seeking asylum in Washington because 
they were being persecuted in Canada after testifying about the Liberal 
sponsorship scandal.

Bedard, who won two Olympic gold medals for Canada in 1984, was arrested 
in Columbia, Md., on Dec. 22 and spent two weeks in a U.S. jail before 
being sent to Quebec City with an RCMP escort.

In April, she was ordered to stand trial on a charge of abducting her 
daughter in violation of a court order by Superior Court Justice Pierre 
Verdon.

Conference report: How to handle executive pay, donors and the press

Museum lawyers and employees met to discuss the most pressing legal 
issues faced by US institutions

By Martha Lufkin | Posted 09 May 2007

The 35th annual conference on Legal Issues in Museum Administration, 
attended by museum staff, lawyers and others, was held in Philadelphia 
on 14-16 March.

Targeting recent prickly issues that have made US museum officials 
sweat, the course gave top billing to stolen antiquities claims: what to 
ask to conduct due diligence before acquisition, whether to settle or 
fight a claim, and how to draft your legal agreement with a foreign 
government to ?transfer? (do not say ?return?) the antiquities it seeks.

The course tackled other problems, including legal and public relations 
crises, the use of donors? names to recognise large gifts, tax 
compliance, museum mergers, and copyright. The conference was 
co-sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution with the cooperation of the 
American Association of Museums.

*Pay your top people?reasonably?*
Tax laws impose a costly excise tax on public charity executives who 
receive excess compensation, and on board members who knowingly approve 
it, says Celia Roady, a lawyer at the firm Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, 
Washington, DC. Bad press about executive pay can lead to a drop in 
public contributions, she warns. Ms Roady advises that museums follow 
IRS rules to ensure that executive pay is presumed to be reasonable: the 
compensation decision must be made by an independent board or committee; 
the board or compensation committee must rely on market data on 
comparable pay for the position; and the board or committee must 
document its compensation decision in the minutes. In addition, says Ms 
Roady, the board should be ?fully engaged? in the compensation decision, 
all elements of compensation should be disclosed to the board, and the 
board should play a role in setting expenses and privileges.

*Sell everything, from the fountain to the new wing*
Many museums have minimum donation policies for the use of donor names. 
Larry Dubinski, Vice President of Development and General Counsel of the 
Franklin Institute, Philadelphia, suggests an inventory of new 
opportunities: ?Start with everything possible that can be named, from 
the water fountain to the stairs to the new wing.? Museums should 
?benchmark gift levels with peer institutions?, such as the local 
symphony orchestra, to make sure that the minimum donations required for 
name use are realistic, Mr Dubinski says. One you have secured a gift, 
invite the donor to a ?meaningful? public ceremony which includes the 
donor?s family, to encourage continued giving.

But what about deviating from an agreement to use a donor?s name? This 
may be desirable when circumstances change, says Elizabeth R. Salasko, 
Associate General Counsel of the University of Pennsylvania, 
Philadelphia. The gift agreement should allow a change if use of the 
name becomes detrimental. For example, Seton Hall University?s 
?Kozlowski Hall? was renamed Jubilee Hall after the donor, L. Dennis 
Kozlowski, was convicted of grand larceny; Mr Kozlowski asked that his 
name be removed to avoid distraction. But after former Sotheby?s chief 
A. Alfred Taubman was convicted of auction house anti-trust violations, 
Brown University kept his name and money for its Center for Public 
Policy and American Institutions, because the gift was given before the 
criminal allegations. Other future changes in circumstance could include 
a need to rebuild or renovate; in such cases, some donors will want 
joint recognition with a future donor.

*When the crisis hits, call your lawyer*
Lawyers from the Smithsonian Institution (SI), Getty Museum and 
Metropolitan Museum, which have withstood significant recent negative 
press, gave tips on handling crises. John Huerta, General Counsel at SI, 
described a public firestorm over its 2005 agreement with Showtime 
Networks, intended to disseminate more information about SI activities. 
When press reports wrongly claimed that the deal would cut access to SI 
collections, Congress slashed the SI?s budget and called for hearings. 
While the SI was able to correct the wrong impression, Huerta advises 
creating a strategic communications plan to anticipate negative 
responses from constituencies and head them off. A separate crisis 
management plan should also be created, to make clear who will respond 
to criticism in a disaster.

The J. Paul Getty Trust has faced a barrage of bad press over its 
antiquities collection and the conduct of its executives. Former 
antiquities curator Marion True is currently on trial in Rome, accused 
of conspiring to receive illicitly excavated artefacts and former Getty 
Trust President Barry Munitz resigned in February 2006 after the Los 
Angeles Times reported a misuse of trust funds including lavish spending 
and other improprieties, later confirmed by an investigation by the 
California State Attorney General. Peter C. Erichsen, General Counsel 
and Secretary of the Getty Trust, noted that any chief executive or 
board member could conceivably ?misbehave or be subject to allegations 
of misbehaviour?. In dealing with the press and public in a museum 
crisis, lawyers should recognise that ?you may in fact be only at the 
beginning of a bad story?, which may unfold unpredictably. When pressure 
builds for a quick response, take your time, Mr Erichsen says, ?and 
stick to the facts?. He added that a new model is emerging for the 
general counsel as a whistleblower, ?who divorces himself from the 
organisation and becomes a truth teller?. But the lawyer should also be 
fair to the organisation, and guide the governing board, he says.

Sharon H. Cott, Secretary and General Counsel at the Metropolitan, 
described the press coverage surrounding the Metropolitan?s return in 
2006 of antiquities sought by Italy as ?obsessive?. She said legal 
counsel should be ?joined at the hip with the press office? during a 
crisis, and should communicate with the governing board and press team 
as the situation unfolds, to avoid surprises. Until an answer is clear, 
the lawyer?s role may be to advise a response of ?no comment? to a press 
question.

*Controlling copyright*
Can a museum control reproductions of objects in its collection which 
are not protected by copyright because they are in the public domain? To 
reproduce such an object, the user must have access to it, which public 
domain status does not guarantee, says Lauryn H. Guttenplan, associate 
general counsel of the Smithsonian Institution. When a museum grants a 
license limiting reproduction of an object in the public domain, are the 
restrictions enforceable? No court decisions directly address this 
question, says copyright lawyer Simon J. Frankel of the firm Covington & 
Burling LLP, San Francisco. But the general rule is that reproduction 
limits under a contract are enforceable, even if exceeding any 
reproduction limits under the copyright law, he says.

But even if they are legal, Mr Frankel asks, are limits on reproducing 
consistent with the museum?s mission to educate and disseminate 
information?

Famous Dominican impresario is in criminal court hearing today

SANTO DOMINGO. - The National District Appellate Court?s 2nd Penal 
Chamber is now hearing the appeal on a lower court?s ruling that placed 
restrictive measures against the impresario George Nader, accused of 
conspiracy to burgle the apartment owned by the Spanish businessman Jose 
Carlos Berganti?os.

In the case heard by judge Ramon H. Gonz?lez the Spaniard?s lawyers say 
Nader sent his driver Boraldino de los Santos in his vehicle to break 
into Berganti?os? apartment where a painting valued at some US$250,000 
was stolen, as well as other properties. Berganti?os lives in an 
apartment located in the center of town.

Berganti?o?s lawyer Vinicio Castillo said First Instance court judge 
Natividad de los Santos was mistaken in her ruling, because she 
should?ve also set bond for Nader at RD$500,000, the same amount as his 
driver.

While Nader?s attorney, Carlos Balc?cer, said the motion is unsuitable 
and that two accusations are debated in the case; one against Nader and 
another against Berganti?os. He said that though the two took part in 
the transaction of a building,

Berganti?os in fact wants to morally damage Nader.

He blamed Berganti?os of falsifying company documents and of refusing to 
have his handwriting verified for forgery.

Berganti?os says he was prevented from entering his own apartment and 
had to get his lawyers to go before the Justice Ministry in order to be 
able to enter his residence.

Nader?s lawyers say this version is "a lie."
