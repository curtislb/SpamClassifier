Lou Dobbs Tonight
Tuesday, April 24, 2007

Tonight, 9 US troops killed, 20 wounded today in the deadliest
attack on Fort Bragg’s 82nd Airborne Division in Iraq.

Millions of Americans turn to student loans to help deal with
the rising cost of a college education. But investigations are
now uncovering corruption and cronyism at all levels of the
student loan industry. They’re finding that millions of
American students have been scammed by the U.S. government, by
student loan companies, and their financial aid offices. We’ll
have a special report.

We’ll be monitoring the House Energy and Commerce Department’s
hearing on food safety in America. Join us tonight for a full
report on what’s being done to protect our nation’s food
supply.

Supporters of enforcing our nation’s immigration laws are on
Capitol Hill today demanding an end to any legislation that
would grant amnesty to the millions of illegal aliens living in
America. Members of Congress, the families of imprisoned Border
Patrol agents Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean, 34 talk radio
hosts, and hundreds of their listeners are speaking out at the
“Hold Their Feet to the Fire” presser against any plans that
will grant amnesty or a guest worker program to illegal aliens.
We’ll have full coverage.

Senator John Cornyn allegedly wants to attach legislation meant
to increase U.S. competitiveness to a bill that would raise the
cap of H1-B visas granted to foreign skilled workers. The
America Competes Act would pump more money into our nation’s
education system to encourage students in math and sciences
while the SKIL bill would make it easier for more foreign
workers to come to the US and take highly skilled jobs from
American workers. We’ll have a full report.

The trial of naturalized American citizen and electrical
engineer Chi Mak continues today in Santa Ana, California. Mak
is charged with conspiring to smuggle American navy secrets to
China. We’ll have the latest updates from the courthouse.

And, three of the nation's best radio talk show hosts: Steve
Cochran, WGN in Chicago, Spie McIntyre, KABC in Los Angeles and
Mark Riley, Air America Radio in New York join Lou tonight.
