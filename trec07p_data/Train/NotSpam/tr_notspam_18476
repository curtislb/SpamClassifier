TONIGHT ON SHOWBIZ TONIGHT- CNN HEADLINE PRIME 11pm ET/ 11pm PT

<b>THE PROBLEM WITH PARIS!</b>

<b>LESSONS FOR PARIS!</b>
What can Paris Hilton learn from former Hollywood bad girls who have turned it all around? From Drew Barrymore to Angelina Jolie to Courtney Love, we're taking a look at former wild child types who have completely changed their image, to see how they did it.

<b>ANNE HECHE'S CUSTODY FIGHT</b>
A judge deals Anne Heche a blow in the nasty custody battle over her son. Why has her soon-to-be ex husband received custody, and what are the outrageous charges they're making against each other? Find out tonight on Showbiz Tonight!
