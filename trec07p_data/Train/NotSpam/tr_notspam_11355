Hello,

=20

Is there a way to pass a variable from one program to another?  I have a
web site that allows the user to set the time they would like to
download a file... The program uses the Linux "at" command and launches
another perl program that does the actual FTP download.  I would like to
pass a parm variable (email address) from the web site, captured in the
first perl program to the second perl program.  Is this possible?

=20

First program uses this line to queue the job=20

=20

system "/usr/bin/at $hour:$minute $tod today < /var/www/cgi-bin/images";


=20

images is a text file containing the perl program that runs the FTP
download:

=20

perl /var/www/cgi-bin/get_image_file.pl=20

=20

 Is there a way to pass a variable from program 1 to program 2?

=20

Thanks for your help!!
