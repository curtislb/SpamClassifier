12:41 PM, 6/21/07, Update: Two Russian computers fail to restart when jumpe=
rs removed for test; other four computers continue working normally=20

Space station commander Fyodor Yurchikhin today tried and failed to get two=
 space station computers to boot up after jumper cables bypassing suspect p=
ower supply switches were removed.

The jumpers were installed last week to recover from a crippling failure th=
at knocked all six of the station's main computers out of action. The elect=
ronic bypass surgery worked, and all six computers later were rebooted.

Early today, with four computers on line and working normally, Yurchikhin a=
nd flight engineer Oleg Kotov fired up the two computers held in reserve to=
 make sure they were healthy, then shut them down and removed the bypass ca=
bles. They then attempted to restart the machines but they failed to reboot.

The test would seem to indicate that whatever problem affected the operatio=
n of secondary power supply switches last week was not a transient event. E=
ngineers still don't know what caused the original problem and troubleshoot=
ing continues.

In the meantime, Yurchikhin plans to restart the station's Elektron oxygen =
generator later today, one of the last major systems to be reactivated in t=
he wake of the computer trouble last week.
