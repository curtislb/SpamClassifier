03:20 p.m., 04/09/07, Update: Soyuz docks with space station

A Russian Soyuz spacecraft carrying two fresh crew members and a wealthy Am=
erican space tourist docked with the international space station today to c=
lose out a two-day orbital chase. The linkup at the downward facing port of=
 the Russian Zarya module occurred at 3:10 p.m. as the two spacecraft saile=
d high above Eastern Europe.

On board the Soyuz TMA-10 were spacecraft commander Oleg Kotov, Expedition =
15 commander Fyodor Yurchikhin and U.S. software developer Charles Simonyi,=
 who paid the Russians more than $20 million to become the fifth private ci=
tizen to visit the space station.

"Contact and capture, docking confirmed, at 11:10 p.m. Moscow time (3:10 p.=
m. EDT)," said NASA commentator Rob Navias from the Russian mission control=
 center. "Docking confirmed, a perfect arrival. Soyuz TMA-10 has arrived at=
 the international space station."

Martha Stewart, a close friend of Simonyi who attended launch at the Baikon=
ur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, was on hand at the Russian control center in K=
orolev for today's docking.

Yurchikhin and Kotov will replace Expedition 14 commander Mike Lopez-Alegri=
a and cosmonaut Mikhail Tyurin, who were launched to the station last Sept.=
 18 aboard the Soyuz TMA-9 spacecraft currently docked to the aft port of t=
he Zvezda command module.

Lopez-Alegria, Tyurin and Simonyi will return to Earth aboard the TMA-9 spa=
cecraft April 20 after a 12-day handover period to familiarize the incoming=
 cosmonauts with space station operations. Astronaut Sunita Williams, who j=
oined the Expedition 14 crew in December after launch aboard the shuttle Di=
scovery, will remain aboard the station with Yurchikhin and Kotov, returnin=
g to Earth aboard the shuttle Endeavour later this summer.

Lopez-Alegria eclipsed the American single-mission record of 196 days April=
 2. With landing April 20, the new record for longest time aloft on a singl=
e mission by a U.S. astronaut will stand at 214 days. Williams will beat th=
at mark and set a new U.S. single-flight endurance record when she ultimate=
ly lands aboard Endeavour.
