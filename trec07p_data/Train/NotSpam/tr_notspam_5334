Lou Dobbs Tonight
Thursday, April 26, 2007

Tonight, the White House says President Bush will veto the
legislation passed today by the Democratic-controlled Senate
that attached a timeline for troop withdrawal to a war-spending
bill. The showdown begins in Washington, and we’ll bring you
the latest this evening.

War on the Middle Class: There is a colossal disconnect between
what’s happening on Wall Street and what’s happening on Main
Street. Corporate profits have never been higher, but
middle-class Americans are struggling just to make ends meet.
We’ll bring you a full report tonight on the growing divide.

China has very little control over its food supply. Yet
Americans are eating increasing amounts of ingredients,
additives and agricultural products from China. These products
are rarely tested by U.S. inspectors, and as the recent
pet-food controversy has illustrated, U.S. consumers are
potentially at risk from highly toxic imports from China. Find
out more at 6 pm tonight.

A former employee of America’s largest nuclear plant has
allegedly given software and plant information to Iran. Federal
authorities say Mohammad “Mo” Alavi, a former engineer in the
Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station for 16 years, illegally
gave software codes to Iran along with information on reactor
designs. We’ll have this shocking report tonight.

And federal officials are taking on the Salvation Army. The
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is suing the charitable
organization for firing two employees who did not comply with
their English-only policy. We'll have a special report on this
growing controversy.

Visit http://cnn.com/loudobbstonight to read Lou’s
latest commentary on how the mainstream media is intentionally
hiding the truth about illegal immigration, and for more on
tonight’s show.

Lou Dobbs lays out his manifesto to save the middle class in
his new book, “War on the Middle Class: How the Government, Big
Business, and Special Interest Groups Are Waging War on the
American Dream and How to Fight Back.” War on the Middle Class
is now on sale in bookstores near you and on Amazon.com and
BarnesandNoble.com.
