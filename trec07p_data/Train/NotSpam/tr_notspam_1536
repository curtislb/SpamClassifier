"Lower Priced Drugs Act" to Improve Patient Access to Generic Medicines
- GPhA Praises Introduction of Stabenow-Lott Bill

ARLINGTON, VA, April 12, 2007-- The Generic Pharmaceutical Association
(GPhA) praised Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Trent Lott (R-MO) for
introducing the “Lower Priced Drugs Act,” which would remove some of the
barriers that currently block affordable generic medicines from reaching
consumers in a timely manner.

“This bipartisan legislation will close some existing loopholes that are
delaying consumers’ ability to access safe, effective and affordable
generic medicines. Closing these loopholes will save our healthcare
system billions of dollars and bring needed, affordable care to patients
sooner,” said GPhA President and CEO Kathleen Jaeger.

Specifically, the legislation would improve access to generic
antibiotics, streamline the citizen petition process, prevent legal
delays in the generic drug approval process, and bring meaningful reform
to the pediatric exclusivity period.

“With generics costing 30% to 80% less than brands, increasing access to
generic medicines will strengthen access to quality, affordable care.
For every one percent increase in the use of generics, consumers could
save $4 billion annually. By closing loopholes, this legislation will
increase access while lowering patient healthcare costs,” Jaeger noted.

“We applaud Senators Stabenow and Lott for their commitment to improving
consumers’ access to affordable generic medicines. We look forward to
working with them on passage of this important legislation,” said Jaeger.

GPhA represents the manufacturers and distributors of finished generic
pharmaceuticals, manufacturers and distributors of bulk active
pharmaceutical chemicals, and suppliers of other goods and services to
the generic drug industry. Generics represent 63% of the total
prescriptions dispensed in the United States, but less than 20% of all
dollars spent on prescription drugs. For more information about the
industry, visit www.gphaonline.org.
