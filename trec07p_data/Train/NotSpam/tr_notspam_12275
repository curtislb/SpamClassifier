Three Cheers for the Alternative Energy Bubble!

Let The Dogs Out

Timely Sell Advice on a High-Quality Stock

-----

I've written before about perception as it applies to individual stocks,
and no doubt I will again.  The fact that stocks move because people's
opinions of them change, and not because of minute fundamental changes at
the company, is one of my favorite topics, and I think it needs repeating
from time to time.

But today I want to discuss perception as it applies to bubbles.  The
takeoff point for this discussion is a new book by Daniel Gross titled
"Pop! Why Bubbles Are Good for the Economy."  I haven't read it, but
reviews suggest that the thesis is worth pondering for all of us.

Common wisdom, of course, tells us bubbles are bad for the economy.   
And recent experience in the wake of the 2000 top of the Internet-centric
stock market bubble reinforces that conclusion among the vast majority of
the population.

But Gross argues differently.  He doesn't deny the pain, in the aftermath
of the bubble's collapse, which accompanies bankruptcies, unemployment and
investment losses.  But he argues that those are all offset - and more -
by the benefits accorded by the new infrastructure.

And he uses history to make his point, looking at the bubbles that
accompanied and supported the rise of the telegraph, the railway and the
Internet.

The telegraph bubble enabled rapid communication across the continent, and
thus enabled the creation of efficient financial markets.  Increasing the
speed with which money could flow increased the speed at which business
could grow.

The railroad bubble enabled rapid low-cost transport of goods and people
across the continent, and thus ushered in the age of consumerism and the
age of increased mobility.

And the Internet bubble?  Without the thousands of miles of fiber-optic
cable laid in the buildout of the Internet, and the accompanying advances
in the technologies of data transmission and storage, we wouldn't have
Yahoo!, Google, YouTube, iTunes, Amazon, eBay, AOL, Monster, Skype,
Netflix, Expedia or any of the other Internet services that we've come to
depend on.

Do those Internet offerings offset the pain and suffering that came in the
collapse of the bubble, or would you rather go back to life as it was in
1990?  I sure wouldn't, and I think most Americans would agree.

And now we come to the best part.

Gross' hope, and I share it, is that the current enthusiasm for
alternative energy keeps on growing from here, inflating higher and
higher, and becoming a bubble big enough to draw in massive amounts of
investment.

The result, ideally, is a new energy infrastructure that helps to reduce
our greenhouse gases and to free us from the complications (to put it
mildly) of imported oil.

It would be enormously disruptive, particularly for people in the oil and
gas industries.  But the long-term benefits would be spectacular.

As much as I hope for it, however, I have serious doubts that a major
bubble in alternative energy will develop, and here's why.

In recent years I've come to believe that the 2000 bubble was of the sort
that comes along only once in a lifetime.  The logic behind this is that
bubbles of that magnitude can only form when memory of the previous bubble
(and the pain that followed it) fades from the collective memory of the
populace.

Thus the 2000 bubble was only possible because most people who suffered in
the 1929 bubble were no longer involved in the economy, through either
commerce or investment.

The 1929 bubble was preceded by the Railway Mania of 1846 in Britain, and
that was preceded by the South Sea Bubble 1720, all far enough apart to
support the thesis that collective memory is key in preventing bubbles.

Today, of course, the memory of the Internet bubble is still quite fresh,
and so it's easy for pundits to "see" (and fear) other bubbles.  There's
the China bubble, the housing bubble, the copper bubble and the solar
energy bubble, to name a few.  The housing bubble in particular is one
that's highly feared because it would hit so close to (ahem) home.

Even the fact that Gross can sell a book about bubbles reflects the
prominence of the theme in the public consciousness.  As a contrarian, I
believe trouble tends to come from where it's least expected, so to me,
all this consciousness of bubbles means we won't have one.

Still I continue to enthuse about solar power stocks because the charts
are strong and the companies are growing revenues and earnings rapidly. 
Last Friday many of these stocks had pulled back to their 50-day moving
averages, offering new investors in the sector a decent buying
opportunity.

Some uranium stocks look good, too.  There's a carbon fiber company (an
old favorite of ours) whose product is being gobbled up by makers of
wind-turbine blades.  And there's a company, public only four weeks, that
generates electricity from wave power.  (Waves are more predictable than
wind, and power can be generated just offshore, very close to where people
need power.)

Bottom line: while a bubble in alternative energy would be nice, you don't
need it to make money in the sector.  The stocks of well-managed companies
in growth industries will continue to prosper, as they always have, and
today we find many of them in the alternative energy sector.

An Opportunity Bigger Than Microsoft?

Hard to believe?  No... not when you consider how one company that totally
dominates an industry can make investors rich.  And we found such a
company.

If you had invested $10,000 in Microsoft back in 1997, '98, or '99, by the
year 2000 your ten grand would have grown to $59,440, $38,550, or $17,640
respectively. The growth potential of the fast-growing company we found is
much greater than its software counterpart - yet it's virtually unknown on
Wall Street.

Companies like this tend to find their way into the pages of Cabot Market
Letter, and when their products are as life changing as those described
above, you'll hear about it from us. Other past big winners include Summit
Technology and Amazon.

Moving on, I want to thank all you readers who took the time to respond to
my request for feedback last week.  It helps to know what you're
thinking.

Here's what one reader wrote:

"I like reading about why you like certain stocks as opposed to other
stocks, and always wonder if I use my paid subscriptions to newsletters
correctly, as I don't seem to ever get ahead.  Often I lose heavily, as
with Global Crossing and other big names I'm ashamed to mention. . . I
continue to hold "dogs" like SCON, DIVX, JDSU recommended some time ago by
other newsletters while I also hold things like VZ, DUK/SE, PFE, MSFT,
DCX, APC and CSCO which I researched and bought on my own. I sure wish you
would cover that in one of your newsletters. . . I realize that probably
most of your readers are much more sophisticated than I, but there may be
dummies out there like me."

Okay, there's a lot to address there, but this reader is no dummy.   
It takes a smart person to ask the right questions, and I present this
letter here because I think a lot of readers - especially newer ones -
have the same questions.

So let's start at the top.

We all like to listen to experts and get advice on buying stocks.   
Buying is easy, because it's done with an aura of hope.  Selling, on the
other hand, is hard, because it means admitting the dream is over.  By
refusing to sell, a person keeps the dream alive, even though the profits
dwindle, or worse, the losses mount.

So when you recognize that your portfolio holds a "dog," like Global
Crossing (GLBC), Superconductor Technology (SCON), or JDS Uniphase (JDSU),
you should sell!  These three, in particular, are dogs because the
companies generally lose money.  DIVX, contrarily, is a profitable
company, but the chart says it's a dog, and one reason jumps out in a
casual inspection: profit margins are shrinking fast.

So whenever you buy a stock you should have an exit plan.  Sure, you're
dreaming of a ten-fold gain, but the reality is likely to be different. 
When you buy a stock, you should know what it will take to sell it.

Now, it's nice if the expert who recommended the stock tells you when to
sell.  And in all Cabot's paid subscription newsletters, we do give
specific sell advice (with the exception of the "Other Stocks of Interest"
section in Cabot Market Letter).  But you've got to take some
responsibility.  After all, it's your money.

Moving on to the "good" stocks in the reader's portfolio, I see Verizon
(VZ), Duke Energy (DUK), Spectra Energy (SE) (spun off from Duke in
January), Pfizer (PFE), Microsoft (MSFT), DaimlerChrysler (DCX), Anadarko
Petroleum (APC) and Cisco (CSCO).  And why are these good stocks?  Because
they tend to be in long-term uptrends.  They're not exactly market
leaders; they're rather large (and therefore slow) to fill that role.  But
they are all extremely well managed and many pay dividends.

But even "good" stocks shouldn't be held forever.  Today we're in a
powerful bull market and most stocks are acting well.  If you're a newer
investor, perhaps you're pleasantly surprised with your ability to make
money by investing.  But you should be aware that many times it is not
this easy.  You should be aware that when this bull turns to bear, it will
have the potential to take away your profits as quickly as it awarded
them.  When that time comes, the way to avoid losing money will be to
sell.

This is just an advance notice, but I give it here because I've seen what
happens to novice investors who fail to sell . . . and it's not pretty.  I
promise to write more on this in the future.

-----

So now here's a specific piece of sell advice.  It comes from the pen of
Roy Ward, editor of Cabot Benjamin Graham Value Letter.

"One of our Wise Owl Model stocks, Exxon Mobil (XOM), reached its Minimum
Sell Price on Friday, May 4, 2007.  We recommend that you SELL XOM now."

"XOM, a giant international oil company, reached its Minimum Sell Price of
$80.94.  XOM shares sell at 13.4 times forward EPS, which is slightly
higher than XOM's 10-year average P/E of 12.5.  We believe oil prices will
remain near current levels or fall somewhat during the next 6 to 12 months
causing XOM earnings to decline by 5% to 10% during the next 12-month
period.  XOM was first recommended in our September 2006 issue at $66.36
and has gained 22% in 8 months.  We recommend that you SELL your XOM
shares now."

Clear enough?

Now, you might say that since XOM has climbed from 81 to 84 since that
sell advice was given, the sell advice was wrong.  Not true.   
The goal of investing is to make money, not to buy at the bottom and sell
at the top.  And the method used by Roy Ward is to buy when a quality
stock is undervalued and to sell when it exceeds its fair value.  After
eight months, XOM brought readers who followed his advice a profit of 22%,
and that's great.  But at a price above 81, risk is higher than his system
likes, so he says sell and move on to another undervalued stock.

I call that success.
