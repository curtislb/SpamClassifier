openeducation writes "I have been researching open source solutions for
K-12 education pretty heavily for the past year and have been
disappointed to find no real alternatives to the large administrative
applications like student information systems, data warehouse, ERP, etc.
But recently, I ran across [0]Open Solutions for Education. This group
appears to be making a serious effort at creating a stack of open source
applications that are alternatives to the large and costly commercial
packages. [1]Centre, an open source student information system that has
been around for a while, is part of the solution stack. They have a data
warehouse and are proposing an open source SIF alternative and an
assessment solution. While the proof is in the pudding, these guys have
working demos and they look pretty good for a first run. K-12 education
is in dire financial straits and solutions like these could help with
lower TCO. Plus, education is a collaborative industry already, which
makes it a good fit for open source."

with Microsoft, and since they already sell SUSE Linux on some of their
servers, but it is likely to put a stop to the OSS community's
celebration of them [2]distributing Ubuntu. The debate over partnership
between Microsoft and Novell has been drawn out since the deal was signed
and for some this will add additional fuel to the fire but shouldn't the
OSS community be reading this as an acceptance of Company's
acknowledgment of Linux?"

The BBC has up a short piece on the hopes of game developers and
investors to 'beat World of Warcraft'. Representatives for the upcoming
Age of Conan, recently-released Lord of the Rings Online, and Star Wars
Galaxies all discuss [0]what it's like competing in a post-WoW world.
Funcom game director Gaute Godoger has a point when he says, "The
industry so needs competition to World of Warcraft ... We need other
strong games that can make people understand that there's more to it than
WoW." The article discusses some of the features each of these games
offer that differ from WoW, and theorizes a bit on where the MMOG genre
will go next.

Last week CVG had a story from the Official PlayStation Magazine, a print
entity partnered with the website, about [0]limitations Rockstar faces on
the 360. For almost the first time, we're now hearing about a title where
lack of space on the disc and the lack of a guaranteed hard drive may be
detrimental to Microsoft's console. "[Rockstar's creative vice president
Dan Houser] continued, 'To be honest with you we haven't solved all those
riddles yet.' The difficulties aren't limited to working on Microsoft's
box, as Houser explains that 'both have enormous challenges' and that
'both have their own particular pleasures and pains'. Rockstar hasn't
said anything about a target SKU between the two consoles, but they're
currently demoing the game to press running on an Xbox 360 - so we
wouldn't worry too much if you've only got Microsoft's console. Look for
more on GTA IV in the next few weeks."

'desert island game' would be. Games from the Civilization series are
backed by the likes of Sony's Phil Harrison, David Jaffe, and Bethesda's
Todd Howard, while Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion has waiting-for-rescue fans
among a number of the list respondents. Bioware CEO Ray Muzyka has an
interesting answer to the question while talking about his pick:
StarCraft. " It's an unusual choice for me in that I'd normally pick a
role-playing game. But StarCraft has a strong campaign editor to make new
content (including making either combat-oriented or story-based
campaigns), plus you can play both the solid single-player campaign and
against the A.I., and -- here's the trick -- you can play on a LAN or WAN
(you said no Internet, but didn't mention local or wide area
networks...my goal would be to build a WAN -- I'd explain how, but that
would be telling -- connecting other folks similarly dropped onto nearby
desert islands by other videogame online sites, who are equally eager to
play some competitive multiplayer RTS or try out the campaigns I've
created to kill time on the long days where there's nothing else to do
but collect coconuts and build rafts." So, assuming that you have
everything you need to play, what game would you want to take with you
into seclusion?

| How the RIAA has Dodged RICO Charges                               |

Gerardo writes "Wondering why the RIAA hasn't been hit with racketeering
charges over its shady legal fight against file-sharing? Ars Technica
looks at why the RIAA has been able to [0]dodge RICO charges. '"Right off
the bat there are some problems with the predicate claims for RICO,"
explained IP attorney Rich Vazquez. "You have to have a pattern of
racketeering activity: either criminal acts where there is a one-year
jail penalty, or mail or wire fraud." Any RICO action brought against the
RIAA would have to focus on the wire fraud component, likely accusing the
record labels of poking around someone's PC without permission.' That's
going to be a difficult argument to make, given that Kazaa's default
settings give users no reasonable expectation of privacy."

majeste (up to 15 years in prison) regarding the recent videos on YouTube
showing the king next to feet, something extremely offensive in Thailand.
'Since the first clip, more new videos mocking the king have appeared on
YouTube, including pictures of the monarch that had been digitally
altered to make him resemble a monkey. Thailand's 79-year-old king,
almost universally adored by Thais, is the world's longest-reigning
monarch, and one of the few who is still protected by tough laws that
prohibit any insult against the royal family.'"

Timogen writes to tell us Wired is reporting that a research team is
reporting that they have found a way to "[0]controllably couple qubits"
bringing us one step closer to quantum computing. "In classical computer
science, bits -- or binary digits -- hold data encoded as ones and zeros.
In quantum computing, data is measured in qubits, or quantum bits. As
such, a qubit can have three possible states -- one, zero or a
"superposition" of one and zero. This unique property theoretically makes
quantum computing able to solve large-scale calculations that would dwarf
today's supercomputers. But qubits in isolation are not very useful. It's
only when they can be connected to one another that large-scale
processing becomes possible."

In the battle against big government and the infamous Real ID,
[0]Massachusetts has hopped on board. In the words of State Senator
Richard T. Moore, D-Uxbridge, "Historically, Americans have resisted the
idea, which totalitarian governments have tended to do, of having a
national ID. That's the broad philosophical issue. I don't think it's a
good move and I would be reluctant to see why we are going to that step."
And State Attorney General Martha Coakley thinks "it's a bad idea."
Should be interesting to see how it gets voted.

by opening the code you are creating your own competition. Today, I'm
here to explore this theory and hopefully prove why it's false.'"

[0]tomsHH writes to mention OSWeekly author Brandon Watts claims that
really it is [1]end users who should be blamed for many OS flaws.
"Believe it or not, as users, we also have a large role to play in the
evolution of an operating system. We use what's been created, and this
means that we're the best people to turn to for judging what works and
what doesn't. Passionate communities that are supportive aid development,
and when users join their efforts to make their voices heard, this
benefits everyone. Have you ever thought that if you wanted something to
be improved, then maybe you should just speak up and offer a solution
instead of quietly or publicly venting without offering any input?
Nothing changes by staying the same. Companies are listening, and as
taboo as it may seem, most of them want to make their users happy, so if
you shout loud enough, you're bound to be heard. If you need proof of
this, then just look at how Linux has progressed in its development."

BackRow writes "[0]Washington Watch, a site devoted to tracking the cost
of federal legislation, has [1]raised the hackles of the Library of
Congress with a new wiki that makes an unfavorable comparison to the
LOC's [2]THOMAS legislative search engine. After Jim Harper, Washington
Watch's creator and the director of information policy at the Cato
Institute, announced the wiki, he received a nastygram from the LOC."
Quoting: "After the announcement, he was contacted by Matt Raymond, the
Director of Communications at the Library (and the author of the Library
of Congress' blog). Raymond said that he possessed 'statutory and
regulatory authority governing unauthorized use of the Library's name and
logo and those of Library subunits and programs,' and he asked that
Harper stop using the names 'Library of Congress' and 'THOMAS' in his
marketing materials."
