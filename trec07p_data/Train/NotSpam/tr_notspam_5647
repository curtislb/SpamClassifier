I meant to say '2.4.0 patched', which became 2.4.1.  The release of 2.4.0 
has the bug: NEWS says

     o	A request for an opaque colour in the pdf() device after a
 	translucent one did not set the transparency back to opaque in
 	2.4.0.

 	Semi-transparent background colours were not being plotted on
 	the pdf() device.
