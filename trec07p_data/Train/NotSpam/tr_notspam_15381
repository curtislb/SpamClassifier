It only exits if there are no clients. If there are no clients, we  
are idle and we have an idle timeout set, then exiting is the right  
thing to do.

Not sure about this. I think this depends on how you define idleness,  
see below.

I don't see how this can be a timed event.

The criteria for exiting is a period of idleness. You could define  
idleness to be a period without any events, but a better definition  
would be a period without any clients. If running any old event was  
enough to be "not idle", then your idle timeout would be completely  
unreliable due to the installation of timed events by parts of the  
server that aren't at all related.

Since only the launchd socket initialisation path sets the idle  
timeout, we could do something like this:
