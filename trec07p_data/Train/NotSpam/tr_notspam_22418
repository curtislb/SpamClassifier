Blueberry Pie Is On The Way

Home Depot Gets Moving

A Most Exciting Value Stock

-----

This weekend I built a sturdy new bird-proof cage around my ten blueberry
bushes, which by the first of July promise to be producing more berries
than we can eat.  These bushes stand over six feet tall, so the picking is
easy, and I have three varieties, which ripen at slightly different times,
so the season extends well into August.   

Some of the berries will go on my morning bowl of cereal, others will be
baked into muffins and pies, some will go on ice cream, and plenty will be
eaten straight . . . perhaps the best way of all.  What we can't eat,
we'll give away or freeze, to be enjoyed in future months.

But this isn't a food column.  This is about the store where I bought all
the stuff to build that cage, Home Depot.  More precisely, it's about the
company, and the stock.

Last week Home Depot jolted investors with a number of announcements that
sent its stock soaring.

The company announced it would sell its HD Supply business, which had
revenues of $12 billion last year, to a group of private investors for
$10.3 billion.  The company had built HD Supply, the second-largest
distributor of construction, industrial and maintenance supplies in North
America, by buying numerous smaller companies over the years, but had
trouble translating its size into profits.

It announced it would repurchase $22.5 billion of its stock (more than 25%
of its shares), its biggest buyback ever.

It announced it would take on more debt to accomplish this buyback.

And it announced the awarding of stock grants to its 10,000 assistant
store managers.  The grants will vest four years after the award date and
will be distributed based on job performance.

The goal of all these changes is to increase earnings per share, and
ultimately get the stock back in an uptrend . . . and in the short term,
at least, Home Depot has succeeded.  Following the announcement, the stock
surged from 38 to 40, hitting a level it hadn't seen since February.

But will this turn into a long-term uptrend?  I think the odds are good,
and I say this because I named Home Depot Stock of the Month back in May
2006!

Back then the stock was trading at 40.  It had come to my attention
through Roy Ward, who had added it to one of his portfolios in Cabot
Benjamin Graham Value Letter.  I liked Roy's reasoning, and as a frequent
customer of the company, I believed in its long-term value, so I wrote it
up for Stock of the Month.  Here's some of that article.

"Home Depot was founded in 1979 by Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank, who
located the first two stores of what was planned, at the start, to be a
nationwide chain, in Atlanta, Georgia.  By 2000, the chain had grown to
1,000 stores and the stock had hit 70, a height it has yet to equal. 
Then, as the stock market bubble burst, the company saw its first quarter
of earnings shrinkage!  So Blank retired in 2001 (he bought the Atlanta
Falcons soon after), while Marcus retired in 2002.

Since then, Home Depot has more than doubled its store count, and expanded
in many directions.  Over 1,000 stores offer tool rental services, over
1,600 offer contractor services.  There are 34 Expo Design stores.  You
can buy over 30,000 products online. . . the upward trend of earnings was
restored in 2001, and today earnings are up 130% since 2000.  But the
stock is still 43% below that old high ... and therein lies the value.

Actually, it's more complicated than that, and the reason that the
Benjamin Graham system works is that few people make the effort to go
through the laborious calculations required to ensure that they're buying
a quality company at a reasonable price.  But Roy Ward does, weighing the
value of some 46 different factors, both fundamental and technical, to
determine that the company is still sound, will not go bankrupt, is
prudently run, and has a margin of safety in its price that ensures that
even a business hiccup will not do much damage to the stock price."

Back then, Roy's maximum buy price was $48.72.  Today it's 44.44.   
Smart investors have been able to buy this stock as low as 36 in recent
months, and they're smiling today.  Roy's target, by the way, is 60.00,
with the expectation that it will take some time to get there.  Patience
is required.  But that's normal for value investors.

In the long run, we're optimistic that the company's announcements last
week will prove powerful enough to change investors' opinions of the
company, and that as those opinions improve (and earnings per share pick
up), the stock will resume its old upward trend.

As it sits now, it's still 44% below its old 2000 high, and still below
the 42 level where it peaked in February.  But I'm confident it will
exceed both those levels in time.

And if the president wants one more idea on how to increase profitability,
he should consider closing a few stores.  Today Home Depot has 2,184
stores worldwide and employs about 364,000 people.   
Three of those stores are within a 15-minute drive of my house, and if any
one of them were shuttered, I'd still be a good customer.

Admittedly, Home Depot's story is not particularly exciting; I like it
because it's dependable.  But there are value stories that are exciting,
and Roy Ward featured one in his latest issue, in which he profiled six
companies with low PEG  (price divided by earnings growth) ratios and
bright futures expectations.

The exciting company is JA Solar (JASO), a Chinese manufacturer of solar
power cells.  JA makes just the cells, and markets them to other
manufacturers, who assemble them into complete modules.  Demand for solar
power, of course, is exploding all over the world, driven by government
supports, increased awareness of the pollution and global warming that
come from fossil fuels, and falling prices.  (One manufacturer has a goal
of reaching parity - where electricity from its cells costs the same as
from the grid - by 2010.)

But to see logic that described a solar power company as a good value was
an eye-opener to me!  The key factor lies in the projected earnings
growth.  Roy projects that JA Solar's earnings will jump 50% over the next
twelve months and expand an average of 30% annually over the next five
years.

If you make those assumptions, you get a very low PEG ratio of 0.69.   
And that makes JASO a very attractive growth stock.

For the record, JA Solar's first quarter report revealed revenues of $43.3
million, up from $0.4 million the year before, and earnings of $0.18 per
share, the fourth consecutive quarter of profits.  The profit margin?  A
fat 18.0%.

Also making it attractive (at least in my book) is the chart, which
reveals a stock in a strong uptrend.  When Roy wrote his recommendation,
JASO was trading at 24.  Today it's 31, hitting new highs.  Next week, who
knows?

Bottom line, solar power is one of the strongest sectors out there, and JA
Solar is one of the top three stocks, based on performance.   
If valuation makes it even more attractive, so much the better!
