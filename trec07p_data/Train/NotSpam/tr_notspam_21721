     Yeah.  Haven't installed yet, but saw that cfdisk was seeing a 
250GB drive on hda.  After throwing rocks at my own head for awhile, I 
finally realized that the IDE module must be installed for that to 
happem. <grins>  Hey, it's been awhile since I've had to do any 
troubleshooting.  That's my excuse, and I'm sticking to it.
