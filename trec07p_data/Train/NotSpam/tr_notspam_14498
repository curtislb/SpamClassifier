Hi,

I am thinking about using Parrot as the VM for a small, experimental
functional language.  My priority is ease of getting things working.  I
was wondering if:

- this is the right list for parrot (parrot-porters-subscribe bounced)?

- whether there was a more suitable venue (more focussed on developing
  languages with parrot than on perl/parrot itself)?

- if anyone could recommend some good code (an already implemented
  language) to copy and hack?

On the last point, all I really need is first class functions, basic
types, eager (partial) evaluation, pattern matching (where is that
handled?) and a little mutability.  In other words, I don't care much
about first class continuations, exceptions, (static) types or
inheritance.

Also, am I right in thinking that I can use whatever language I want for
generating the IR?  Are there any libraries/toolkits for various
languages?  I hate to admit it, but I would prefer not Perl (sorry,
haven't used it for years...), although if that's hugely easier I guess I
go that route anyway.

Thanks,
Andrew
