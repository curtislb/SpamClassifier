<p><img src="http://www.bookcrossing.com/images/Scott-headshot-138.jpg?date=4%2F24%2F2007+7%3A27%3A35+PM" align=left hspace=5>...from the 6th Annual BookCrossing Convention in South Carolina.  I kid you not.  
It was quite an experience.  The Charleston BookCrossers turned on true Southern Hospitality for all the attendees and guests.  It was a 3-day epic adventure 
of book lovers from around the world.  For those of you not able to attend, imagine close to 1000 books wild released in a town chock full of literary 
history.  Another 1000 or so books got new journal entries there in Charleston, as controlled releases, trades and gifts from far flung BookCrossers for 
the Book Buffet.  And lest you think it was all high brow talk in hushed library tones, I can tell you personally that BookCrossers know how to have 
fun.  Laughter was a main ingredient of the weekend.  If you're in doubt as to the accuracy of my words, check out the blogs, journal entries 
and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/330163@N24/pool/">pictures</a> created by members to commemorate the time.  Smiles are the main ingredient.  
 South Carolina was my first stop in many travels planned throughout the year.  I really want to hear from you first hand how we can make BookCrossing a 
 better worldwide book community.  I’m looking forward to attending the Frankfurt, Germany BookCrossing event(17 &mdash; 20 May) in a couple of weeks and 
 it's sure to be an event to remember.  Hopefully I'll be at the MegaBookCrossing 2007 in Nice on June 23.  Then on to the UK UnConvention at the end of 
 June, which also promises to draw a big crowd.  The Australian convention is in early October and all signs point to an equally strong showing 
 bringing BookCrossing Blokes and Sheilas from near and far.   <p class=indent> I’m not going to dive into business detail in this initial piece.  I want to 
 simply say “thanks” to everyone I’ve met in person and through email and reiterate my commitment to helping BookCrossing maintain its position as the 
 largest free book club on the planet.  No one else even comes close to what we have.  Your loyalty and dedication to the site is appreciated by everyone 
 associated with bookcrossing.com and we will work harder than ever to keep you coming back! <p class=indent> <p>Best to all,<br>

<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/169/474489765_dd13d0f885_m.jpg" align=left hspace=5>Perhaps you heard a huge cheer last month when BookCrossing's new servers  went to work?  Just 
in case you think that's all that is new, here's a little list of some of the new site improvements.  A big thank you to Matt, who heads the best tech team in 
the world, for all the hard work to help us keep on 'Crossing.  He was the genius behind our new Catch and Release Mapping feature (and listened when we sent 
up a plea to keep the side bar recently released/caught feature).  Matt is the Support Team's "Go-To" guy when there's a problem, and he's yet to be 
stumped.  Site wide, there's an ongoing effort to make sure that all features work on all operating systems, both PC and Mac.  Our sign-up page has been 
streamlined to make it easier for folks checking out the site to stick around and join the fun.  There is an improved book look up and support for 13 
digit ISBNs when registering a book.  Our database has gone through initial tuning to increase query speeds.  Some of the important links, such as FAQs, 
Contact Us, and our Privacy Policy can now be found at the bottom of <i>every</i> site page.  (And have you noticed that our FAQs are easier to read and 
navigate now?)  There's a message from our CEO now listed, and there will be regular updates from Scott in the newsletters.  All in all, the site is going 
through a <i>BIG</i> spring cleaning.  Much of this was presented at the Charleston Convention in April.  Be sure to check out the 
<a href="http://www.bookcrossing.com/videoclips">videos</a> and <a href="http://www.texaswren.com/video2007.html">video transcripts</a> 
(thank you <a href="http://www.bookcrossing.com/mybookshelf/TexasWren">TexasWren</a>!) for more information.  Keep your eyes open for all sorts of new and e
xciting features, improvements and upgrades.<HR>

<p>
<p><img src="http://i126.photobucket.com/albums/p116/bcnewsletter/panera.jpg" align=left hspace=5>Here's some yummy news:  Panera Bread&reg; bakery-cafes in select 
areas will become Official BookCrossing Zones this month! Not only will each Panera location in San Diego, CA, Chicago, IL and Jacksonville, FL feature OBCZs, 
some locations will also host BookCrossing Gatherings in May and June. Many BookCrossers meet at Panera Breads across the US already
<img src="http://i126.photobucket.com/albums/p116/bcnewsletter/ballybaguette-2.jpg" align=right hspace=5> and love the warm, welcoming environment, fabulous 
food and free wi-fi. It's a winning combination for sure! Check the <a href="http://www.bookcrossing.com/forum/22/4376940/1">Meetings and Conventions 
Forum</a> for dates and details.  And if you don't live in one of those cities, but have a Panera near you, why not stop in, say hello, share a meal and 
release a book? (Our marvelous image of Ballycumber with a baguette was created by <a href="http://www.bookcrossing.com/mybookshelf/Moem">Moem</a>.  It would 
make a tasty addition to your Panera Bread releases!)

<p>One thing is certain:  when BookCrossers gather together, good cheer, great conversation, and lots of laughter abound.  Rumor has it there is even 
occasional talk of books!  If you couldn't make either of these events, be sure to do a little armchair traveling via an 
<a href="http://www.bookcrossing.com/articles/2645">article</a> written by <a href="http://www.bookcrossing.com/mybookshelf/aris1">aris1</a> for our

gathered in Charleston also had a grand time, and promise to get an article or two in over the next little bit.  In the meantime, they tell us you can 
catch a glimpse of a lot of the festivities over at the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/330163@N24/pool/">BookCrossing 2007 Anniversary/North

 <img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/169/467941096_947457529b_m.jpg" align= left hspace=5>As many of you know, it takes a tremendous amount of 
 time and tact to manage the support emails and keep this site successful and running for free. We couldn’t do it with out our fabulous, behind-the-scenes 
 Volunteer Support Team! This bunch of committed, zealous BookCrossers are extremely generous to donate their time and talent to maintain the literally 
 hundreds of questions, problems, issues and queries that come through the contact link and in the forum every month. They expertly help 
 <img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/172/471610785_2d15392664_m.jpg" align=right hspace=5>Scott and me manage the volumes of press requests, 
 email, and general business-related inquiries that get fielded on a daily basis. We sincerely couldn’t do it without them (ok, ok, but it would cost 
 us our first-borns and an arm and a leg &mdash; none of which Scott and I are able to give). Having said that, it is our honor to “officially” welcome 
 long-time, passionate and VERY active, UK BookCrosser, Netstation, to the Volunteer Support Team. Steve has been an active “unofficial” behind-the-scenes 
 contributor acting as a UK ambassador, giving the Europeans a good show on the radio  and does a fantastic job of interviewing and fielding the UK press 
 on our behalf. In addition, Steve is the contact person for the 2008 BookCrossing Anniversary Convention held in London. We are ticklishly excited to 
 have him join the ranks of the Volunteer Team.  Welcome Sir Steve!!

I believe I'm about to commit the northernmost book release so far. I'm participating in a sea ice field measurement campaign at arctic schooner Tara, now 
situated at 87 degrees northern latitude (see http://www.taraexpeditions.com/). Tara is a French ship that was deliberately frozen in sea ice in the Fall 
of 2006 off the coast of Siberia. Tara will drift with sea ice and hopefully arrive in Fram Strait between Greenland and Spitsbergen in 2009. My trip to 
Tara is a part of a European DAMOCLES research (http://www.damocles-eu.org/) which aims to better understanding of the climate change to the arctic....

<span class=asubtitle>Manuscript Takes a BookCrossing Journey Round the World<br></span>

<p>
In July of 2005, our London based Trust were working on the preparation of a manuscript for publication entitled <i>Unlock Reality</i>. Some of our 
proofreaders took a shine to the work, and wanted to see it released early. There seemed no way to do this until one of them suggested, why not release 
a few copies via BookCrossing. The thinking was that at the very least this might provide us with some feedback and comments which might be helpful in 
its presentation to publishers....

<p>Wild books released by our members are being caught all over the world, every day! Our <a href="http://www.bookcrossing.com/forum/11">site watch</a> forum is where members post 
news of great wild book catches. Here are some of the best from the last few days...<br>

This was among a couple of boxes of books I dropped off at a Canadian Forces base several years ago for inclusion in care packages to troops overseas.  It has 
just turned up at an American base and the finder has joined. <p> <a href="http://www.bookcrossing.com/journal/1661488">http://www.bookcrossing.com/---/1661488</a><span class=tiny><br>

someone let the 4 year old pick up the book at the bus stop, rather than telling them to leave it alone! Let's hope mummafour, AUSSIE73 and her son hear from the book on its travels.<span class=tiny><br>
