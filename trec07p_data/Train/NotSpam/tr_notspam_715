2. Are You Required to Send W-4 Withholding Forms to the IRS?

In the past, employers were required to submit all Forms W-4 that claimed complete exemption from withholding when $200 or more in weekly wages were regularly expected or claimed more than 10 allowances. Employers are no longer required to routinely submit potentially questionable Forms W-4 to the IRS.  

The IRS is stepping up its withholding compliance program by making more effective use of information reported on W-2 wage statements to ensure that employees have enough federal income tax withheld from their paychecks.

3. California Dentist Sentenced to Prison for Tax Fraud

A California dentist was recently sentenced http://www.usdoj.gov/tax/txdv07111.htm to serve 24 months in prison, for conspiring to defraud the United States and evading income taxes. According to court documents, the dentist hid approximately $300,000 from the IRS using a tax evasion scheme involving the use of false invoices and secret offshore bank accounts.
