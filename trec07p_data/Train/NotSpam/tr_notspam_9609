OK, I'm reading through different unicode related perldocs and have a  
rather simple question.

Under perl version 5.8, does /(\w+)/ match UTF-8 characters without  
calling any special pragma?  I'm having a hard time finding something  
that makes the statement that clearly.

I'm trying to parse out email content and it seems reasonable that I  
could get characters in just about any conceivable format, from  
ascii, latin, utf...

For simplicity I'm leaning in a direction of just converting everying  
"up" to UTF8 and working all my string/regex manipulations on UTF.

So I'm trying to see if I can just use /(\w+)/ without worrying about  
all this character encoding?
Or do I have to first Encode everything into UTF8?
And if so, before I Encode it, do I have to figure out what it is  
first and then convert it from whatever encoding it is to UTF8?

For simplicity, it isn't necessarily a requirement that I can parse  
the content into perfectly accurate words, but they have to be  
completely repeatable and preferable fast.

help?
