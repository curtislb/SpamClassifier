Exactly.  And some functions, like exit(), are explicitly not declared in
header files on many systems.  I believe this has to do with some
compatibility issue with C++, but I don't know the details.  

> The correct fix is to fix the missing declaration.

No.  It's not an individual user's responsibility to make changes to system
header files.  There are sometimes reasons (as with exit) that functions are
not declared in system header files.  Making manual changes will screw up
future system upgrades.  System header files should not be touched.

No.  The purpose of that feature (from my point of view -- I don't know who
put it in or what their intention was) is to ensure that non-declared *SAMBA*
functions are identified and declared, not to try to fix what may or may not
be broken systems on which the development is being accomplished.

On systems that provide declarations for all functions, my change will have no
effect.  It has an effect only on systems where some system functions are
missing declarations in system header files.  If you've succeeded in a
developer build and compile immediately prior to this change, you will still
succeed with no changes to what configure detects nor to your build.  Only
those (few?) systems where some functions are missing declarations in system
headers are affected, and this change allows them to compile in developer
mode whereas immediately prior to this change, they could not compile.

I'd still like to hear alternate implementation suggestions that solve the
problem.

Cheers,

Derrell
