That's exactly my argument. You didn't need to learn that because you
weren't specifically doing anything with Pod. It doesn't even come up
because it's something you have to affirmatively do, and it's not
something that accidentally happens.

I'm not sure what you mean mean by "- + -".

Our current Learning Perl class starts off with a little Pod
manipulation because we know that everyone (should!) has the perldoc
along with their Perl. My actual experience trumps your serious doubt
:)

How is that braindead? It's perfectly fine, allowable, and intended
that a Perl 5 programmer can break statements over more than one line.
It's not weird at all.

I've taught a lot of beginner Perl classes, and people do all sorts of
things.

The problem is that once you bring something up, people want to know
why you brought it up, and then they start playing with that point to
see what you meant. All of a sudden, you're explaining a lot of stuff
that doesn't get people any closer to completing a simple program.

As I've said previously, the rule for Pod looks simple, but the rules
for other things, such as strings, are now more complicated. However,
Larry mentioned that the Pod extractor may do what it likes, but Perl
shouldn't have to live with it's decisions about what is executable
code and what isn't, so it may still work out.
