 From perldoc:
This attribute is specifically designed for use in Unix applica-
            tions that "fork" child processes. Either the parent or  
the child
            process, but not both, should set "InactiveDestroy" on  
all their
            shared handles.  Note that some databases, including  
Oracle, don't
            support passing a database connection across a fork.

In short -- you are lucky it can be supported.
But in order to keep things portable, this might be something to avoid?
