It would help to have a reproducible example. The alphabetical order
thing is a side effect of the factor() function, and to avoid it you
need to supply the levels when you create the factor; e.g.

> factor(month.name)
 [1] January   February  March     April     May       June      July
 [8] August    September October   November  December
12 Levels: April August December February January July June March ... September
>
> factor(month.name, levels = month.name)
 [1] January   February  March     April     May       June      July
 [8] August    September October   November  December
12 Levels: January February March April May June July August ... December

(Note the different order of the levels)

As for the colors, you can add either

col=c("green","purple")

or

par.settings = list(superpose.polygon = list(col=c("green","purple")))

The first will change the color of the bars but not the legend, the
second will change both. (The reasons this works are a bit convoluted
if you are not familiar with lattice, and you don't really need to
know, so I won't go into them)
