The term is not defined in a precise manner, but I think that it's clear
enough.

Not in my understanding.
AFAICS, a program with two interfaces could be something that may be
started in such a way to offer a GUI, but also in a different way to
offer an interactive textual command interpreter, for instance...

As long as the web application presents the same kind of window to each
client, it has only one interface, AFAICT.

Minor nitpick: program B wants to reuse the algorithm *implementations*
(algorithms are not copyrightable, only their implementations are).
But anyway, let's go on...

Maybe, but my proposed clause is *not* intended to mandate this, as no
interactive interface of program A is kept in program B.

Maybe it's clearer if the clause says:

  "this feature must be preserved in each interactive interface that is
   present both in the Program and in the work"

As stated above, my proposed clause is *not* intended to mandate the
preservation of the feature that displays legal notices, when the
affected interactive interfaces are dropped.
Of course program B must have appropriate copyright notices and stuff
required by the rest of the GNU GPL.  But, with my proposed clause,
program B would not be compelled to implement a feature to display legal
notices in the interactive interfaces that are not "taken" from program
A.

That is the same exact result that we would get in your previous example
(assuming that my proposed clause works as intended...).

Wait, let me understand: are you criticizing my proposed clause because
you feel that it's not restrictive enough?
If this is the case, please note that it's *intended* to be *more*
permissive than clause 5d of GPLv3draft3!  After all, I said that my
proposed clause is a *weakened rephrase* of clause 5d!
Indeed, I hope that my proposed clause is more permissive than clause 2c
of GPLv2...
