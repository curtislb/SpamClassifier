You are asking for a whole book..... it hasn't been written yet.

Your best bet is to search google and groups.google for "perl threads".
Gather up all the example code you can, run them, and see how they work.

You should also spend some time looking at threads in c, so you can see
the difference in implementation. There are many good c thread tutorials
on google.

c threads make it much easier to share data and subroutines between
threads.

The best thing to do, is work out little example code snippets, and try
to make the threads communicate. While doing that you will run into all
the little details which you need to know.

Good luck,
zentara
