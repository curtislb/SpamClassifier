OK, on to the next one...

charset = iso-8859-9
Quoted-Printable

MIME::QuotedPrintable seems to only do conversions to ASCII which  
screws up the conversion.

I could do conversion to utf via:

use Encode;
decode('MIME-Header',$string)
where $string is represented as  a header: =?iso-8859-9?Q? 
d=FC=FE=FCnd=FCr=FCc=FC?=

this is a bit of a hack from a message body that is encoded as Quoted  
Printable.
but I can't seem to find any command/function that would let me do a  
conversion of QuotedPrintable text eventually to utf8.

the binary stuff I can do, it's the QP stuff that seems to be messier.
