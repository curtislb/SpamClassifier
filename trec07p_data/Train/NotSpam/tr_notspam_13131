						Today's Quote for the Day:
<br>
=20
<br>
"I will not do full frontal. I need somewhere to go as an actress" - Lindsa=
y Lohan.
<br>
=20
<br>
Indeed. In tonight's programme:
<br>

<br>
<b>How Green is Blair?</b>
<br>

<br>
We've an exclusive interview with the Prime Minister on the environment. Ou=
r environment analyst, Roger Harrabin will be asking the Prime Minister abo=
ut his record on climate change and the political controversy over the Gove=
rnment's new strategy for getting rid of waste.
<br>
=20
<br>
<b>Housing</b>
<br>

<br>
Zombie Brown swept into Number 11 Downing Street ten years ago promising to=
 bring stability to the housing market. In his 1997 budget speech Mr Brown =
said, "I will not allow house prices to get out of control". Ten years on a=
nd they have spiralled leaving tens of thousands of people unable to get on=
to the first rung of the property ladder.=20
<br>

<br>
So - do we need a housing crash? Is some kind of soft landing possible? How=
 many more new houses do we need - and where will they be built?
<br>

<br>

<br>
<b>Cannes</b>
<br>

<br>
There have been few Union Jacks flying over the Croisette: in fact the 60th=
 Cannes film festival has been a pretty British film-free zone, apart from =
two notable exceptions.=20
<br>

<br>
Both of them focus on British rock icons - one a biopic, about the lead sin=
ger of Joy Division, Ian Curtis, who committed suicide in 1980, and the oth=
er, a documentary on the lead singer of the Clash, Joe Strummer, who died a=
ged 50 in 2002. Razia Iqbal reports for Newsnight from  Cannes.=20
<br>
=20
<br>
<b>And finally...</b>
<br>

<br>
Stop him before he kills again. Yesterday's abysmal joke by a Newsnight sta=
ff member going under the name "Peter C" has been followed by one just as e=
xecrable, and (I would guess) about 20 years old:
<br>

<br>
What's the first sign of madness?
<br>

<br>
Suggs walking up your drive.
<br>

<br>
Newsnight is at 10.30 on BBC2
