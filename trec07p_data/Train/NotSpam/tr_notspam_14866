A few thoughts:

1. Where are you setting '&delete_posterfile'; and to what are you setting it?

2. IIRC, following a sub declaration with empty parentheses tells the
compiler that that sub doesn't take any parameters.  Within the scope
of the delete_file sub, @_ is set to '()'; so shifting or assigning
from @_ to a list will always result in null assignments.  Try
removing the '()' from the sub declaration lines.
