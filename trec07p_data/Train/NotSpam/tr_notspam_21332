It was being discussed on the perl6-users list, last year.  And see 
ext/Web/ in the Pugs repo.  Actually, see ext/HTTP/ first, since the 
2 come in a pair, as a result of said discussion, and have been in 
the Pugs repo since Feb 17th.  Actually, see 
http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/ext/HTTP/docs/ first, which is a copy of 
the important emails by Juerd which the HTTP+Web were started from.
