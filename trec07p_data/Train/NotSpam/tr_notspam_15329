Hi,

I am trying to copy some file from a removable HDD to a network 
drive. I want replicate the directory structure and omit un-needed 
files.

The directory paths a 4-5 levels deep and I am trying to work out an 
efficient way to recreate the directory path.

What I've been doing is using File::Find to collect the file and then 
in the coderef calling the following subroutine to check the path but 
i didn't go too far as my method seems....well not well formed.

The path to a source file looks like:

e:/Dir1/Day 1/AM/01/myfile.jpg


use strict;
use warnings;
...
...snip

sub check_dir {

# @_ = File::Find::dir

 my $path = shift;
 return unless (-e $path);

# Split the path on it's parts.
 my @parts = split('/',$path);

# Loop from 1 to skip the first part of the path.
 for (my $i = 1; $i <= $#parts; ++$i)  {

	my $l = $dist.'/'.$parts[$i];
	if (! -e $l) {
		print "Checking $l\n";
		my $j = $i + 1;			# urg!
		my $lev = $dist.'/'.$parts[$i].'/'.$parts[$j];
		if (! -e $lev) {
			print "Checking $lev\n";
		}
	}
 }

Can anyone offer me some advice with this?
Thanx,
Dp.
