I wanted to explain. Yes. I know these Speech-Dispatcher bugs are only present in SMP systems.
Turning off smp support in the Linux kernel would mean obviously losing a core, but it would temporarily solve all issues I have with it crashing until a new public release is made available. What concerns me is whouldn't there be omre issues due to this at that point with compiling programs, running servers etc? Let me know.
