I stumbled across it because I was re-running the build tools tests in 
t/tools/pmc2cutils/*.t.

[parrot] 502 $ prove -v t/tools/pmc2cutils/00-qualify.t
t/tools/pmc2cutils/00-qualify....1..9
ok 1 - use Parrot::Pmc2c::Utils;
ok 2 - Makefile located
ok 3 - myconfig located
ok 4 - lib/Parrot/PMC.pm located
not ok 5 - only 2 file suffixes in src/pmc

#   Failed test 'only 2 file suffixes in src/pmc'
#   at t/tools/pmc2cutils/00-qualify.t line 26.

         Test returned status 1 (wstat 256, 0x100)

Now, granted, the test that failed may have been written in a too 
restrictive manner.  But I was trying to determine which files in 
src/pmc/ I needed to copy to a temporary directory for the purpose of 
running tests later in the test suite.

Since I use src/pmc/class.pmc later in the test suite, I may have to 
reformulate a test there as well:

[parrot] 506 $ grep -n 'src/pmc/class' t/tools/pmc2cutils/*.t
t/tools/pmc2cutils/05-gen_c.t:286:    my @pmcfiles = ( 
"$main::topdir/src/pmc/default.pmc", "$main::topdir/src/pmc/class.pmc", );
