 Hi,

We have recently launched our online music portal called
TempoStand<http://www.tempostand.com/>.
It is a platform for promoting independent artists in India. All the music
parked on TempoStand is Creative Commons BY-SA license. People are free to
stream music online. They can also download music or buy a CD by paying for
it and mix it and then share it.

We have recently released our first album called - Lights. It is light
fusion music with some folk and instrumentals. You can listen to the
tracks at www.tempostand.com

We are not specific to any genre. The more experimental the music, the more
we love it. There are plenty of other features we are going to release soon.
You can go to tempostand.com/updates to view our blog. We were wondering as
to how important in terms of creative freedom, is it to offer music download
for free? and if we do go ahead and make it free for download, how would it
affect us in terms of revenue? I mean would many folks buy  CD? I say that
because thats one way we intend to support our artists. We also intend to
sell merchandise so music is not the only thing but still we would like
to hear some arguments pro or against the idea.

Looking forward to your feedback.

Thanks
Ujjwal Grover
