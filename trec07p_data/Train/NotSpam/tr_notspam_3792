05:15 a.m., 04/21/07, Update: Soyuz TMA-9 undocks from space station

Departing space station commander Mike Lopez-Alegria, Soyuz commander Mikha=
il Tyurin and American businessman Charles Simonyi undocked from the intern=
ational space station's Zvezda command module at 5:11 a.m. EDT today, setti=
ng the stage for landing in Kazakhstan around 8:30 a.m..

"Thank you very much for the hospitality. I enjoyed working here and workin=
g with the excellent crews and commanders," Simonyi said during a farewell =
ceremony erlier this morning. "I'm looking forward to the return flight. It=
 is a bittersweet moment for all of us. We are very sad leaving the station=
 but at the same time looking forward to continuing our work on Earth."

If all goes well, the Soyuz TMA-9 spacecraft will fire its braking rockets =
at 7:42:30 a.m. for four minutes and 18 seconds, slowing the craft's 5-mile=
-per-second velocity by about 258 mph. That's just enough to drop the craft=
 into the atmosphere on a trajectory leading to a landing zone in Kazakhsta=
n where Russian recovery forces will be standing by to greet the returning =
spacemen.

05:16:30 AM - Space station attitude control re-enabled

07:42:30 AM - Deorbit ignition (planned velocity change: 257.7 mph)
