moscowde writes "Researchers at Cornell University have created a
so-called [0]Nano-Lamp — a microscopic collection of light-emitting
fibers with dimensions of only a few hundred nanometers. The fibers are
made of a polymer spiked with ruthenium molecules in a process dubbed
'electrospinning.' The bright spots on the fibers are smaller than the
wavelength of the light they emit. The nanofiber glows bright orange when
exposed to an electric field and can be seen in the dark with the naked
eye. A professor at Princeton University called this 'a breakthrough in
the way nanosize light sources are made.' Since the nanofibers are
flexible, they could potentially be used in clothing or bendable computer
displays."

Proudrooster writes "In the past two weeks [0]AT&T has sent out
disconnect letters to VOIP customers in big rude red letters, stating
that VOIP service will be suspended in 30 days and permanently
disconnected in 60 days. They cited E911 service as the reason. (It is
peculiar that AT&T is unable overcome an E911 technical hurdle, since
SBC/AT&T is also the local landline company in many areas where VOIP
cancellation notices are being received.) Many AT&T VOIP customers have
found that they are unable to transfer their phone numbers to a new
provider. Further, AT&T is unwilling to set up a forwarding message
directing callers to a new phone number for those who are unable to
transfer their old numbers. In effect, AT&T has told many long-term VOIP
subscribers: 'We are turning off your phone in 30 days, goodbye.'"

[0]Tjeerd writes in to alert us to the publication in a highly respected,
peer-reviewed journal of [1]results indicative of table-top fusion. The
US Navy's Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center in San Diego, CA (called
Spawar) has apparently been conducting research on "cold fusion" since
the days of the discredited report of Pons and Fleischmann. They are
reporting on the reproducible detection of highly energetic charged
particles from a wire coated in palladium-deuterium and subjected to
either an electric or a magnetic field. Their paper was [2]published in
February in the journal Naturwissenschaften (which has published work by
Einstein, Heisenberg, and Lorenz). New Scientist also has a [3]note about
the fusion work but it is available only to subscribers.

There is an good video on NPR about [0]how real human reactions translate
to the virtual world. It's interesting in view of the question posted
here about [1]rape in Second Life. The video covers a little experiment
in SL where a reporter gets together with a psychologist to see if some
unspoken human rules apply in the virtual world — such as staring or
standing too close to someone. Perhaps surprisingly, in this world where
you can be or do just about anything, you can't break these unspoken
rules with impunity.

[0]Van Jacobson gave a [1]Google Tech Talk on some of his ideas of how a
modern, global network could work more effectively, and with more trust
in the data which changes many hands on its journey to its final
destination. [1]Watch the talk on Google's site The man is very smart and
his ideas are fascinating. He has the experience and knowledge to see the
big picture and what can be done to solve some of the new problems we
have. He starts with the beginning of the phone networks and then goes on
to briefly explain the origins of the [2]ARPAnet and its evolution into
the Internet we use today. He explains the problems that were faced while
using the phone networks for data, and how they were solved by realizing
that a new problem had risen and needed a new, different solution. He
then goes to explain how the Internet has changed significantly from the
time it started off in research centres, schools, and government offices
into what it is today (lots of identical bytes being redundantly pushed
to many consumers, where broadcast would be more appropriate and
efficient).

[0]gmueckl writes "Since [1]Blender was released as open source in 2002,
it has basically owned the open source 3D modeling scene. Its development
has seen a massive push by both the community and supporting
organizations. However, the program has been showing its age all along
and efforts to improve on it have either been blocked or have failed
[2]in [3]the [4]past (note the dates). Authors of new modules are forced
to jump through hoops to get their work glued onto the basic core, which
still dates from the early 90s and has gone almost unchanged since. There
are many other active projects out there like [5]Art of illusion, [6]K-3D,
and [7]Moonlight|3D. Each of them offers a modern, much saner, more
coherent, and more powerful basic architecture and could match Blender in
a couple of months' time with some extra manpower. So how come these
projects don't get the level of support they deserve? How come developers
are still willing to put up with such an arcane code base?"

[0]Eric Goldman writes "A couple of years ago Utah enacted a 'Child
Protection Registry.' The idea was to allow parents to register kids'
email addresses and then to require certain email senders to filter their
lists against that database before sending their emails. According to the
Salt Lake Tribune, the Utah registry has been a '[1]financial flop.'
Initially projected to generate $3-6 million in revenues for Utah, it has
instead produced total revenues of less than $200,000. 80% of this has
gone to Unspam, the for-profit registry operator; Utah's share of the
registry's revenues has been a paltry $37,445. Worse, Utah has spent
$100,000 (so far) to defend the private company from legal challenges by
free-speech, advertising, and porn interests."

overwhelming passage in the US House of Representatives of the [1]Genetic
Information Nondiscrimination Act. As written, the bill would prohibit
insurance companies from charging higher rates, and employers from
discriminating in hiring, based on the results of genetic tests. A Boston
Globe editorial notes that the bill has been [2]held up in the Senate by
the action of a single senator, who has an (outdated) objection based on
his anti-abortion stance. President Bush has said he will sign the bill
if it reaches his desk.

Reader [0]reporter tips us to a story just up at the NYTimes reporting
that the tough-talking conservative candidate [1]Nicolas Sarkozy has won
election as the president of France. His opponent, Socialist Party
candidate Ségolène Royal, the first woman to get as far as the runoff in
a presidential contest in France, has conceded defeat. The vote went 53%
to Sarkozy and the turnout was a remarkable (by American standards) 85%
of registered voters. Sarkozy is seen as a divisive figure for his demand
that immigrants learn Western values (and the French language).

the center. The practical applications are a ways off, as even the design

Reader [0]gbulmash sends us to his essay on the [1]fallacy of those who
would abolish copyright. The argument is that without copyright granting
an author the right to set licensing terms for his/her work, the GPL
could not be enforced. The essay concludes that if you support the GPL or
any open source license (other than public domain), your fight should be
not about how to abolish copyright, but how to reform copyright.
