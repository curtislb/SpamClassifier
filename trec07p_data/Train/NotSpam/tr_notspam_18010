Yes  - definitely. It's already down.

Well, they'll have to change that ...

I'm also CCing Imri, as I know he can help with this.

OK. I get :

The following entries were submitted: Submission-Type: new

Site: mirror.isoc.org.il
Type: leaf
Archive-http: /pub/debian/
CDImage-http: /pub/debian-cd/

A proper project/trace directory was not found on the HTTP server.

The error message returned was: 404 Not Found

If you don't understand this error message, please contact us.

Entry not submitted!

Although http://mirror.isoc.org.il/pub/debian/project/trace/ is there. 
And I tried to access it from gluck.d.o and it went fine. Could you check?
