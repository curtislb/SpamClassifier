Join Donny George and SAFE in remembrance of the looting of the Iraq  
Museum four years ago. In a matter of days, thousands of ancient  
artifacts from the cradle of civilization were stolen or destroyed.  
Even more devastating, the looting of ancient sites continues to this  
very day, not only in Iraq, but all around the world.

On Tuesday, April 10-12, 2007, pause for a moment of silence and  
light a candle, wherever you are. You can also join SAFE in the  
vigils being organized around the world, please go to http:// 
www.savingantiquities.org/i-safe-alert.php for a list of locations  
and times. Images and videos of the vigils will be compiled in a  
Video Memorial which will be presented to the current Director of the  
Iraq Museum as well as international decision makers. These images  
will also be broadcast via AssyriaSat, the global satellite  
television network. Show your support, participate in the Global  
Vigil and send us the images.

Call for the return of more than 7,000 antiquities that are still  
missing. Demand an end to the international black market trade of  
antiquities which feeds the looting of archaeologicaI sites, in Iraq  
and around the world. Protect ancient civilizations not just for the  
people of Iraq but for all of us, for future generations to come. We  
must not forget.


Thank you,

Massey releases rare books details 

Details of the rare books stolen from Massey University have been released
by librarian John Redmayne. Seven books feature on the list with a realised
value of $25,110, but Mr Redmayne said Massey had since removed one because
it could not prove that the copy belonged to the university. 

In all, Massey lost 19 books, valued at about $40,000, but only six, worth
$23,310, were involved in charges brought against its former New Zealand and
Pacific librarian Karen Dale Churton, 48, who was sentenced to 11 months'
imprisonment on April 2. An appeal has since been lodged against the
sentence. An application for bail was disallowed. 

"Karen told police that Maori Art (a book by "Hamilton" that sold for $1800)
was a personal copy and not stolen from Massey," said Mr Redmayne. "There is
a copy on the shelves in the Bagnall Collection and we cannot prove we had a
second copy." 

The six other books on the police "Massey List" were : 

A book on missionary voyages in the South Pacific compiled from journals of
officers and missionaries aboard the ships involved, valued at $1000. The
author or editor was unknown, but the volume was titled A Missionary Voyage
to the Southern Pacific Ocean, performed in the years 1796, 1797, 1798, in
the ship Duff commanded by Captain James Wilson. 

The Art Album of New Zealand Flora, by Mr and Mrs Edward H. Featon, was sold
for $800. 

An Elementary Manual of New Zealand Entomology: Being an introduction to the
Study of our Native Insects, by G. V. Hudson, sold for $110. 

A set of three books by Joseph Dalton Hooker. The Botany of the Antarctic
Voyage of HM Discovery Ships Erebus and Terror in the years 1839-1843 under
the command of Captain Sir James Clark Ross, Kt, RN, FRS. Parts 1 and 2.
This volume sold at auction for $9000. 

Part 3, dealing with the flora of Tasmania, sold for $7000. The final book,
on "Flora Novae-Zelandiae", realised $5400.

Iran to Appeal London Court for Rehearing on its Artifacts   

London Court?s verdict for putting 17 items of Jiroft?s historical artifacts
in auction has aroused the concern of Iran?s cultural heritage experts.
Tehran, 8 April 2007 (CHN Foreign Desk) -- London Courts recent ruling for
putting 17 items of Persian historical relics looted from Jiroft historical
site up for sale has evoked the response of authorities of Iran?s Cultural
Heritage and Tourism Organization (ICHTO), cultural heritage experts, and
NGOs. In this regard, ICHTO is determined to take action against the court?s
ruling through making a complaint to the rehearing court. These ancient
artifacts had been plundered from Halil Rud historical site near the city of
Jiroft in the Iranian province of Kerman. The smugglers then illegally
crossed the borders of the country with these valuable objects, considered
part of the Persian heritage, and sold them abroad.  In an interview with
CHN, Omid Ghanami, director of the Legal Department of ICHTO said: ?London?s
Court ruling for putting 17 items of Jiroft?s historical relics has aroused
the concern of cultural heritage experts. Therefore, we are determined to
study the case from all aspects in an attempt to recover Persian artifacts
through appealing to the court for rehearing.?  The litigant of Iran in this
case is the Barakat Gallery, which has collected a large number of Jiroft?s
historical relics and intends to fight any appeal, said it had acquired good
title to the artifacts under the laws of France, Germany, and Switzerland,
where it brought them. According to The Independent, Lane and Partners, the
gallery?s London lawyers, said the antiquities were mainly bought at auction
and were valued at about ? 250,000.   According to Ghanami, Iran has still
the right to follow up the case through the rehearing court. ?Currently we
are trying to estimate Iran?s chance of winning at the rehearing court. The
Legal Department of ICHTO is also determined to make an accurate assessment
on the expenses of the appeal,? added Ghanami.  The whole story started when
cultural heritage authorities found out that Jifort?s stolen relics were
being auctioned by Barakat Gallery in London, they immediately took action
and asked the London Court to stop the selling of these invaluable relics.
The court ordered the gallery to stop selling them and asked it to come to
an agreement with Iran about them. However, although the gallery took these
artifacts out of its auction, it refused to give them back to Iran despite
Iran?s proposal to give 150,000 British pounds as compensation. Following
that Iran took the case to London Court for the second time last summer.
The case was first taken to the court by Iran with the help of the
International Law Department of Paris. Iran and France worked closely to
prepare a file and submit it to London?s court to prove Iran?s claim for the
ownership of these relics.    Anyway the recent ruling of London Court
indicating that 17 pieces of Jiroft?s historical relics can be sold in an
auction, has not only evoked the emotions of cultural heritage enthusiasts,
but has also violated UNESCO?s 1970 convention indicating prevention of the
illicit import, export and transfer of ownership of cultural properties,
which UK has also ratified it.  According to The Independent, Jeremy Scott,
a lawyer acting on behalf of the Iranian government, said the ruling was a
setback of those trying to stop looters. ?It will be of great concern to
many countries throughout the world as it places their archeological
heritage at further risk,? said Scott.    In a statement, the gallery said:
?We do understand the Islamic Republic of Iran?s desire to preserve its rich
and diverse heritage. However, there mush also be protection for those of us
who, quite legitimately are dealing in antiquities.?  Halil Rud historical
site was one of the first places where civilization and urbanization were
established. A large number of stone, clay, and architectural remains from
the third millennium BC were discovered during archeological excavations in
the site. However, after such a rich civilization was discovered in Halil
Rud region, lack of appropriate protection and management in this historical
site and lack of public knowledge about how to preserve their cultural
heritage, and the smugglers who took advantage of this situation and sold a
large amount of these historical relics illegally all led to such a dilemma
we are facing today.        At present ICHTO is trying to prepare a file and
gathering valid document which prove Iran?s claim for ownership of these
invaluable artifacts which are currently in possession of Barakat Gallery.

Police Search For Stolen Artwork
KOTV - 4/9/2007 1:22 PM - Updated 4/9/2007 6:36 PM

There is a lead in the investigation into stolen artwork in Tulsa. A thief
made away with a statue created by a renowned Native American artist. It was
taken from a Tulsa gallery. When a thief took the $11,000 statue from Joseph
Gierek Fine Art in January, it was the first time in 25 years that Gierek
had anything stolen. News On 6 anchor Craig Day reports investigators now
have a lead in the case.

"Certainly hopeful that something comes of it and we get it back," said
Gierek.

After our first report on the theft, a tipster contacted Gierek saying she
had seen the stolen bronze on Craig's List, an online classifieds site.

"She says she couldn't remember anything at all about who the artist was or
what they were asking for it, but she says there is no question that when
she saw the image on the report, that was definitely the bronze she had
seen," said Gierek.

The bronze was sculpted by world-renowned Native American artist Allan
Howser. Howser was originally from Oklahoma and is recognized as one of the
most notable artists of the 20th century. Tulsa detectives and the insurance
company investigator are following up on the lead.

"The information has been forwarded and just keeping our fingers crossed
that we can get the bronze back," said Gierek.

In the meantime, Gierek has added high-tech security cameras to keep
anything like the theft from happening again. The stolen bronze has also
been reported to an international registry for stolen artwork. A reward is
being offered for the return of the stolen statue.
