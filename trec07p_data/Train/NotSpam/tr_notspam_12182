How to Set Up Google Adsense Referrals 

This one is for your website owners out there!   Google Adsense Referrals is a new program with the potential for top paying Google Adsense payouts.  The Google Referrals program allows Adsense publishers to hand-pick the Adsense ads that they want to appear on their site, and get paid per action (i.e. sale or sign-up) rather than per click.  Setting up your Adsense Referral ads is not hard, but the site is not as straightforward as it could be, so we're here to help you figure it out.
