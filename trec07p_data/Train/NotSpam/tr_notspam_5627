						<B>TERRORIST ARRESTS</B>
<br>

<br>
It took just 19 pilots to create carnage in America on 9-11 and rewrite the=
 history books for ever. Today, the Saudi Government announced the arrest o=
f 170 Al Qaeda suspects - some of whom, it says, were training to fly to ca=
rry out attacks.=20
<br>

<br>
It's an astonishing figure that evokes a visceral response: How do you imag=
ine a terrorist plot nine times bigger than September 11th? And in the last=
 few hours, it's emerged that the USA has also arrested a leading Al Qaeda =
figure, Hadi al Iraqi - a man wanted in connection with assassination attac=
ks on President Musharraf of Pakistan.  We'll have the latest developments =
on both stories tonight.
<br>

<br>
<B>SUPER RICH</B>
<br>

<br>
If you were a billionaire and really really didn't want to part with your c=
ash to pesky old tax, where would you choose to live?  Belize? Monaco? Caym=
an Islands? Well actually you could do worse than the UK. The IMF has, for =
the very first time,  ranked Britain alongside these tax havens - for the l=
oop hole which allows the super rich who live here to avoid paying up on mo=
ney earned abroad.=20
<br>

<br>
This of course, under the beady watch of a Chancellor whose protestant work=
 ethic and acute awareness of injustice are part of his DNA. Tonight, we'll=
 be asking why there are no plans to close the loophole and whether people =
close to him may actually be profiting from it.
<br>

<br>
<B>ROSTROPOVICH</B>
<br>

<br>
In musical circles, Mstislav Rostropovich, who died today in Moscow, was a =
genius and a world renowned cellist.  In political circles, he was a powerf=
ul emblem of the resistance to Soviet communism.=20
<br>

<br>
The two sides of this extraordinary personality came together most dramatic=
ally on the night the Berlin Wall came down in 1989 - bursting into spontan=
eous concert in support of the pro-democracy protestors that tore down the =
symbol of the Cold War.  Tonight, we speak to a former pupil about his lega=
cy.=20
<br>

<br>
Join me tonight at 10:30pm on BBC2.

<br>
And then on Review, I'll be joined by Mark Kermode, Bidisha, Peter Whittle =
and Dotun Adebayo to review a film already hailed as a classic.=20=20
<br>
=20
<br>
<b>THIS IS ENGLAND</b>
<br>

<br>
Shane Meadows has directed This Is England - a return to the Thatcher era w=
hen the Falklands War was not long over, unemployment was kicking three mil=
lion, there was a skinhead revival and the National Front was recruiting.=
=20
<br>

<br>
This is England is a film about class, race, music, skinheads, New Romantic=
s and belonging. Although not strictly autobiographical, some scenes mirror=
 events in Meadows' life. Like the central character, 12 year old Shaun, pl=
ayed by first timer Thomas Turgoose, Meadows was adopted by a skinhead gang=
 and the film does much to give skinheads their cultural place, rescuing so=
me of them from their violent racist reputation.=20
<br>
=20
<br>
<b>ENGLEBY</b>=20
<br>

<br>
Sebastian Faulks leaves the long ago past behind in his new novel Engleby, =
in which the unreliable, deeply disturbed narrator Mike Engleby takes us in=
to his secretive world, from his unhappy days at boarding school, through h=
is reputation as a misfit at Cambridge to his career as a journalist in Lon=
don in the '80s, to his life now and the demons he has to face.=20
<br>
=20
<br>
<b>CALLED TO ACCOUNT</b>=20
<br>

<br>
"The Indictment of Anthony Charles Lynton Blair For The Crime Of Aggression=
 Against Iraq" is playing at the Tricycle Theatre in London. Entitled Calle=
d to Account, it is the latest collaboration between Richard Norton-Taylor =
and Nicolas Kent who created verbatim theatre pieces such as Nuremberg and =
Bloody Sunday at the theatre.=20
<br>

<br>
This is a departure from that format in that it is an inquiry commissioned =
not by government, but by the theatre. Leading barristers gave their time f=
or free to conduct interviews during last January and February with key fig=
ures including the neocon Richard Perle, the former Weapons Inspector Scott=
 Ritter and the former International Development Secretary Clare Short. The=
se interviews were then edited for the play which is designed as an even ha=
nded inquiry.=20
<br>
=20
<br>
<b>BJORK</b>=20
<br>

<br>
And finally Bjork. Her new album Volta is perhaps her most accessible - it =
certainly could put people on the dance floor. Unlike her last release, thi=
s has a riot of instruments, and some scorching lyrics.=20
<br>
=20
<br>
Do listen in and sing along at 11pm.=20=20=20
