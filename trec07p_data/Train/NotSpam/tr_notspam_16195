In dealing with areas that I have researched thoroughly and lived
through, I am not afraid to say that facts are facts.  When I am not
sure, I throw in appropriate qualifiers (such as "I cannot imagine
xxx", "At least in the US, ..." or even "IANAL").  When I do not think
I have enough good information to make a useful contribution, I make
no comment.  When appropriate, I cite the relevant documents.

I am no stranger to the idea that I might be wrong.  When someone
points out facts that contradict my position, I pay attention.  When
the only critiques are based on me not having a secret decoder ring --
whether the ring means "JD" or "DD" -- I tend to discount them.

I do not pretend Debian should pay much attention to whether I think
choice of venue is an appropriate tradeoff for the DFSG, for the
reasons you mention.  I do believe that many of the arguments in favor
of choice of venue clauses are factually wrong[1], that those should
be corrected before a decision is made, and that the decision should
not be a casual one.

I have not attacked your position by attacking you.  I have pointed
out where and why your posts were wrong, stated why I did not think my
corrections needed to be backed up by specific citations, and asked if
you would take seriously someone who made analogous errors of fact in
a different area.  You asserted in another post that -legal was often
not taken seriously by the rest of Debian; it seems fair to point out
why there may be similar feelings in the other direction, at least as
far as legal analysis goes.
