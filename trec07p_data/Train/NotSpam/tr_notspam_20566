Hello sm1lies,

We've got a reposted Development project now open for registration, with $1,500 in total prizes.

The Titan Segment Service Version 1.0 is a C++ component. The component will provide a stand-alone executable, and has little dependency on other components -- basically, it's the perfect opportunity for C++ developers to get into the component game and earn some money. 

And don't forget: With the new rules for the Digital Run, placement points are tied to prize money, so this is also a great chance to earn twice the DR points of a standard Development project. 

Learn more and register here: http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=ProjectDetail&pj=30001930

Good luck!
