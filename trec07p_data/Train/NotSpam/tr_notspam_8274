Hi Jen,

Thanks for your suggestion, I don't have a master build script, I do it 
be hand through phpMyAdmin and then use the backup feature of that if I 
want to move it.

I'm really looking for something that I can say to: "compare this 
database with this one and tell me what the differences are" and it can 
give me something like:

table.column has type VARCHAR(255) in DB1 but type TEXT in DB2
table.column is indexed in DB1 but not in DB2
table.column_2 does not exist in DB2
table_2 does not exist in DB2

And also possibly a machine readable output format so I can process 
making DB2 the same as DB1 automatically, although I think I may prefer 
to still make the change manually. Not sure of details yet but need 
options first :)

Obviously I may end up writing some or all of it myself but it seems 
like something someone else has probably done and it would save me time 
if it's out there somewhere or at least a starting point such as the 
diff analysis.

Cheers,
Nigel

If you set it up to have a directory structure to sort scripts by db object type (c:/tables, c:/tablespaces, c:/ views, etc.) then you can diff by subdir & only run what you need to rebuild for an update.
