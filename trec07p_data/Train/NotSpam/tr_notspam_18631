I cannot have *alternative* language, since there currently is *no*
language to define the term "user" at all...  ;-)

Seriously: I think it's really hard to reasonably define what a remote
user is or should be.  I don't have a proposed definition, because
everytime I try to think of one, I find myself trapped in blurred
boundaries and don't know where to draw the line (or how to get back
home!).

No idea...

Indeed.

Moreover, what if I turn the AGPLed code into an OS kernel?

Less ambiguous, maybe, but worse for sure, since it would extend the
restriction to any use of the modified program.  And all the issues with
kiosks, pay-toll machines, arcade games, and so forth, would come back
(as for the AfferoGPL v1).=20

The restriction in the GPL is about the act of conveying copies of the
work.
The restriction in the AGPL is about *using* the modified work: there's
a cost associated with *use*...

If the source doesn't fit in the server the modified version runs on
(think of small embedded systems, for instance), I have to set up a
separate server to provide source to remote users.
In order to *run* the modified version of the Program!
If I cannot afford setting up a separate server, I cannot use the
modified version on a network!

As I said above, the GPL restricts the act of conveying, the AGPL also
restricts the use of modified versions of the Program.
