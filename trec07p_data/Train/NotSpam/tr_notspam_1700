I understand that. It's certainly possible. But what happens if
someone stays within the bounds of the copyright license, and
strays outside the bounds of the trademark license? Which one wins?

Your argument is that the trademark holder will win, because the
licensee exceeded the trademark license. I am afraid someone will
argue that the copyright license (from the same entity) should count
for more than the trademark license, and that therefore he should win.

The big question is, will a jury also fail to see that? 

My view is, if a restriction prevents someone from arguing an
unlikely case, and does not hamper legitimate situations, go for it.

True. But how is anyone's freedom affected by the useless baggage
of a "no confusion with Debian" clause?

Well, in a way I suppose. "What's that doing here?" 

On the other hand, someone further down the road may remove the fish
and recover the swirl-and-bottle, then put that on his own CD-ROMs
with operating systems, which he then sells. Now what?

That is true. But Microsoft had nothing to do with the image, so
the license or origin of the image is irrelevant when it alleges
trademark infringement. In this case, it would be more like
Microsoft giving you an image, saying you could do anything you
wanted with it, and then sued saying "oh wait we didn't mean you
could do *that*". Would that look reasonable to a jury?

> As I said above, I think that none of them "wins".

As I said above, you're now relying on a jury agreeing with you.
I'm European, so my opinion is based on hearsay, but in my opinion
the last thing you want in a lawsuit is hoping the jury agrees with you.
