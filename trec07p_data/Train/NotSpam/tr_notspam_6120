As much as I'm always wary of the Sony marketing spin machine, I have to =
agree this could be positive for CC. =20

However, there's still something odd about some of their comments in the =
press, it appears they are using CC as a clarification tool to distance =
themselves from copyright issues associated with YT.  The CC license is =
default, and there's a clear warning not to upload (c) materials.

For instance here's a post I noticed the other day on a PS3 news site :=20
http://www.pspsps.tv/2007/04/sony_hops_on_youtube_bandwagon_1.html

This isn't a direct crit, like everyone else I'm just curious as to =
where this goes and intrigued as to the possible cc-goals of one of the =
big-4 content corporations.  It could be they have a real interest and =
wish to encourage artists to switch to CC licenses.  It could be just a =
marriage of convenience and a mechanism to justify tight content =
control.=20

  Sony=92s YouTube competitor - CC licensed

Today is Sony Day!

I would like to ask everyone on the list to raise a cheer for yet =
another multinational capitalist corporation's co-option of the free =
culture movement. Truly the valorization of the hard-earned work of =
millions of unpaid, free creators across the world should be celebrated =
for contributing yet again to the profit margins of the world largest, =
richest and most powerful corporations. Today should be recognised as a =
breakthough for creative commons moving from a grass-roots organisation =
committed to the creativity of everyone, to becoming the trusted advisor =
and advocate to capital for implementing a new form of IP policy that =
encourages 'sharing' --- well, sharing as long as it is the output of =
*us*, rather than anything that the multinational might produce (then =
clearly it is criminal and it is piracy).=20


Hurrah for SONY DAY!



(One can only hope that one day, in the future, everyday will be named =
after a giant multinational corporation!)
