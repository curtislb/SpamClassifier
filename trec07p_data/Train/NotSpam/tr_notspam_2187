HEADLINES:
WORST MASSACRE IN U.S. HISTORY
Officials are calling it the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history.  Today a gunman apparently acting alone went on a shooting spree, killing at least 21 people in two locations and wounding at least 29 on the campus of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, also known as Virginia Tech, in Blacksburg.  In addition, the gunman was killed, Virginia Tech Police Lieutenant Wendell Flinchum told reporters.  "Some of the victims were students," he said. "At this time, we believe there was only one gunman."  Virginia Congressmen Tom Davis and Randy Forbes, who spoke by telephone with Governor Tim Kaine's chief of staff and other officials, citing Virginia officials, said a total of 32 people, including the gunman, were dead.  The governor's office could not confirm that number.  Forbes said they believe the shooter was a student and that he turned the gun on himself.  But the Virginia Tech Police Department, the lead agency in the case, said it did not know where th!
 e higher number had come from. It said its count remained 22 dead, including the shooter.

Virginia Tech President Charles Steger said authorities were working to identify the victims and notify their relatives.  "Today, the university was struck with a tragedy that we consider of monumental proportions," he said. "I cannot begin to convey my own personal sense of loss over this senseless and incomprehensible, heinous act."  President Bush was "horrified" by the shootings, White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said.  "His immediate reaction was one of deep concern for the families of the victims, the victims themselves the students, the professors and all the people of Virginia who have dealt with this shocking incident," she said. The U.S. Senate and House of Representatives each held a moment of silence.

Police were alerted to the shootings at around 7:15 a.m., when they were notified in a 911 call that there were several victims at West Ambler Johnston Hall, a four-story dormitory on campus, Steger said.  About two hours later, more shootings were reported in nearby Norris Hall, he said.  Many of those hurt are hospitalized.  "We heard some loud banging," said a student who identified himself as Josh, a junior who was in a building near West Ambler Johnston Hall. "We weren't sure if it was construction or not and then we heard some people screaming."  He said that after he and other students heard 30 to 40 shots, they jumped from a second-story window and ran to safety. "It was very hectic; I've never experienced anything like this before," he said.  Classes are canceled for the remainder of today and tomorrow.

THREE SOLDIERS KILLED IN IRAQ, U.S. REPORTS
Three American soldiers were killed today in Baghdad, the U.S. military announced.  Two other soldiers were killed Saturday in Falluja, commanders said in a written statement.  One soldier was killed when his patrol came under small-arms fire in southwestern Baghdad, the military said, and another was killed by a roadside bomb in the southern part of the city.  An explosively formed projectile struck another Baghdad patrol, killing one soldier and wounding two others.  The Falluja deaths took place in a roadside bomb attack, the military said.  Their deaths bring number of U.S. troops killed in Iraq to 3,308 since the 2003 invasion that toppled former dictator Saddam Hussein.

WHITE HOUSE CONDEMNS RUSSIAN OPPOSITION CRACKDOWN
Today, the White House criticized Russia's weekend crackdown on anti-government protests, including what it called the "heavy-handed" use of police to break up demonstrations in Moscow and St. Petersburg.  Hundreds of anti-Kremlin protesters clashed with riot police yesterday in St. Petersburg, a day after a similar demonstration in Moscow. The protesters accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of rolling back democratic reforms and persecuting his political opponents.  "We underscore that allowing peaceful expressions of protest is an essential element of democracy and a universally recognized human right," White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said.  The marches, which the government had banned, were cut short by riot police. Perino accused Russian authorities of "an emerging pattern of use of excessive force by the authorities in reaction to similar events" and called the arrests of journalists covering the protests "intolerable."  There is no immediate response from Russi!
 an officials.

PRES. BUSH PUSHES DEMOCRATS BEFORE MEETING ON WAR SPENDING
Today, President Bush made clear that while he will use meetings with Democrats this week to discuss a new supplemental bill for the Iraq war, he is unlikely to give much ground on major issues of dispute.  "I am willing to discuss any way forward that does not hamstring our troops, set an artificial timetable for withdrawal, and spend billions on projects not related to the war," Mister Bush said.  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid responded that the president "has a choice to make in the coming days: cling to the discredited policies that have led our troops further into this intractable civil war or work with a bipartisan majority in congress to make us more secure."  The president, in televised remarks before a supportive group of military families at the White House, slammed Democrats for rejecting the bill he sent to Congress.  He also condemned the versions of the bill passed by the House and Senate, saying they "would undercut our troops" and "would impose restrictio!
 ns on our military commanders."  "The American people expect the leaders in Washington to find common ground, but they also expect the Congress and the White House to work together to make sure our troops get funded, quickly. We should not legislate defeat in this vital war," he said.  He added, "I hope the Democratic leadership will drop their unreasonable demands for a precipitous withdrawal."

WICKED WEATHER POUNDS THE MID-ATLANTIC, NORTHEAST
A powerful nor'easter continued to pound the mid-Atlantic coast today, prompting acting New Jersey Governor Richard Codey to declare a state of emergency due to excessive flooding and storm related damage.  Codey is urging New Jersey residents to stay at home, adding, "Its just going to get worse. It’s not going to get better."  More than 30,000 state residents are without power, Codey said, and traveling remains hazardous. More than 50 state roads were closed or partially closed throughout New Jersey, transportation officials confirmed. Train travel was suspended on three New Jersey Transit train lines this morning after they were submerged by water, and lines into New York City were experiencing 15- to 20-minute delays.  In New York, Central Park experienced its second largest rainfall since 1869, when a total of 7.57 inches of rain fell in the park on Sunday.  Con Edison is currently working to restore power to about 900 New York City homes. In neighboring Westchester Cou!
 nty, 3,700 residences are without power. The electric company shut down power to about 3,000 of those houses after county officials expressed concern that flood waters might reach basement power supplies.
