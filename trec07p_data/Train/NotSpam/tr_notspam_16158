No, the real problem is the internal interfaces.

For example, in kerberos_verify,c, there is a call to  
"name_to_fqdn(my_fqdn, global_myname())".

If the host has a DNS configuration that includes a conventional  
search path, this works. If it works, it does exactly the same thing  
as get_mydnsfullname(). In fact, there are no uses of name_to_fqdn()  
that cannot be replaced by get_mydnsfullname(). AFAICT, name_to_fqdn()  
exists only because someone was not able to find get_mydnsfullname().

If I have a decent header file, I can see the full interface in a  
single screen, along with comments, macros and typedefs. I don't think  
the argument about the extra typing involved in changing headers by  
hand is very strong, since the code needs to be read and understood  
thousands more times than it needs to be written.
