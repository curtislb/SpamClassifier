Yes, wineyes does seem to have scrolling issues in text-based
programs. This is not only true in the command prompt, but is also
true with teraterm pro as well. However, my problem wasn't that I
wasn't seeing errors produced by qemu. I was certainly aware for
example of the error I got when it couldn't find the bios files.

Alex, thanks for the virtualbox suggestion. I hadn't heard of that one
before, I'll give it a look.

Greg
