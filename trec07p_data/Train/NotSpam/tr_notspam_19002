   The following is a letter I just wrote to my MP, my past MP, and the 
person who tabled C-453.  This is in case anyone wanted to write similar 
letters.

Dear Mr. David McGuinty (my current MP),
      Hon. Mauril Bélanger (My past MP before I moved)

Copy to Mr. Don Bell, the Liberal member who tabled C-453.


   Now that Bill C-59 has passed without any "debate" (just some
patting on each others backs from the Liberals, Conservatives and Bloc),
I wanted to offer a comment on Private Members Bill C-453 from the
Liberal member from North Vancouver.

   As a reply I would like to offer an Information Week article by
Canadian Science Fiction author Cory Doctorow titled "How Hollywood,
Congress, And DRM Are Beating Up The American Economy".  He has also
given this recently as a talk titled "Happy Meal Toys versus Copyright:
How America Chose Hollywood and Wal-Mart--and why it's doomed us, and
how we might survive anyway."

Summary, in my words: The US government has given up on manufacturing
and much of the rest of their economy in return for what they thought
would be a privileged "first mover" position in a new Industrial
Information Economy. This new economy hasn't emerged, and won't likely
ever emerge. Even with receiving over 50% of worldwide royalties the US
has not been able to replace what they gave up with what they mistakenly
thought they could gain. They are fighting against the Internet and peer
production, which are increasingly successful methods of production,
distribution and funding. These competing methods are quite different
than what they envisioned.



   Backing Hollywood is the wrong policy for the USA, and it is an even
more wrong direction for Canada.  We should not be contemplating
providing government resources to add to the already well financed
special interest lobbying effort, as proposed in C-453 with a
secretariat to further promote the interests of the incumbent Motion
Picture industry.

   Please consider listening to, watching and/or reading the
article/talk linked above.  Avoiding this disaster is in my mind second
only to the Climate Change crisis.

   I believe that avoiding the unnecessary friction in tech transfer and
global collaboration that these policies would suggest may turn out to
be a critical part of the solutions to the Climate Change crisis.  We
already have extremists seeking to patent bug fixes to software, so it
is not too far fetched to have companies trying to unethically skim
money off (and block) attempts to solve environmental problems.


   I am available to speak with you at your convenience.  I am scheduled
to meet with Mr. Bélanger soon.
