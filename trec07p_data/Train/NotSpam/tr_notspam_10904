The Great:
Mrs. Bartolozzi (stunning. A friend of mine hates Aerial as a whole, except
for this track which he described as "a work of art".)
A Coral Room (Yeah, I'm a sentimental old fool.)
Prologue (So simple, so good, could do without the intrusive percussion at
the end though.)
Aerial (Yey! Upbeat uplifting fun. I thought I would get bored of this, but
still play it twice at the end.)

The Reasonable:
Bertie (charms the pants of me.)
Joanni (the only real single potential on the album, apart from a dance
remix of Aerial that is. She has done much better though.)
An Architect's Dream (nice.)
Sunset (nicer - but she does drag out the middle part by repeating the same
lyrics again. The way she sings "Could be honeycomb" is gorgeous.)

The Bland:
Pi (good idea, but as I said, needs a good kicking. She should have let the
weirdness in.)
How to Be Invisible (even more boring than Experiment IV.)
Somewhere in Between (a dull backing beat and I find Kate's singing doesn't
please me.)
Nocturn (the very beginning is great, then that backing beat makes the next
4 minutes rather dull. It finally gets going though.)

Oh, yes I can agree with that, and get rid of that annoying fade out as
well. It is interestingly done, but like Experiment IV I find it does
nothing for me.

TD is easily my favourite, with TKI, HoL, Ae, TSW bunched together (in that
order for now). Although I can see TSW making a comeback over time. It is
my most played KB album as I had a spare copy in the car for years, so I've
got a soft spot for it. NFE and Lh come next with TRS trailing.

IMHO, the first half of "A Sky of Honey" is one of the best things that
Kate has ever done. Aerial Tal (as cute as it is) breaks the flow of the
piece, then I have to wait until the last part of Nocturn before I get back
into it again.
