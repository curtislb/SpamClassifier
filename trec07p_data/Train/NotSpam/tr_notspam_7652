This is throwing spaghetti against the wall to see if it will stick... 

I know there have been some Windows compatibility improvements in recent
versions of MIT Kerberos (such as TCP support for password changes). So
upgrading it may help you avoid other problems, but...

More spaghetti: Any chance of trying Heimdal Kerberos?

When I ran into this problem, only Windows Kerberos was in play. So
chances are good it has nothing to do with Kerberos at all.

You might also try enabling NetLogon debugging on the windows side and
then playing around with ntlmauth to see if any clues come up in the
windows log files

Running out of ideas fast...
