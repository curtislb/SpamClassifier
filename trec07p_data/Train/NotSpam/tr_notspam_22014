FAT32 is also much more likely to be corrupted that NFTS
if you have a BSOD or something, and I never use it for the
windows partition. The reason I suggested FAT32 was 
because I thought NTFS was still read only on linux but
Greg pointed out it's now possible

I have had many a FAT32 file corruption over the years 
but so far not one NTFS. OMG maybe microsoft did 
something fairly decent. hehe
