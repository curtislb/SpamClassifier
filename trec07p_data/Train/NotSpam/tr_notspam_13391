						<div class=3D"GreyHeading">KEN BROWN ON THE PGA CHAMPIONSHIP</div>
						<div>The European Tour's flagship event, the PGA Championship, has at=
tracted seven out of the world's top 15 golfers to play at the beautiful We=
st Course at Wentworth.
<br>

<br>
One of those, world number five Ernie Els, lives on the Wentworth estate an=
d he has been the mastermind behind the redesign of the West Course over th=
e past two years.
<br>

<br>
The changes he has made have been widespread and the bunkers he has built f=
or this year's tournament brings the total added to 36.
<br>

<br>
With the weather being so good, and the course so firm and fast, many playe=
rs have fallen foul of Els's tweaks and the enlargement of the ditch on the=
 12th fairway has attracted its fair share of controversy.
<br>

<br>
There's a noticeable absence of players from the American Tour here, but th=
eir circuit is so strong that it's difficult to prise people away.
<br>

<br>
Englishman Justin Rose, though, is one that has returned from the States to=
 play in Britain for the first time since 2004 and his first-round performa=
nce oozed class.=20
<br>

<br>
A back injury has stopped him playing since his fifth place finish at the M=
asters in April, yet he has showed no ill effects or rustiness on the West =
Course so far.
<br>
=20
<br>
Keep an eye on Ryder Cup hero Padraig Harrington, as the Irishman could be =
leaving the course a very happy man on Sunday.
<br>

<br>
His win at last week's Irish Open has given him the chance of scooping a on=
e million Euro bonus if he can become the first player to win back-to-back =
in Ireland and then here at the PGA Championship.=20=20=20
<br>

<br>
He wasn't at his best during his first round, but that often happens after =
you've just won as you can get fatigued with all the press conferences and =
attention.
<br>

<br>
But he battled through it and the signs seem good as his short game looked =
as world class as ever.
<br>

<br>
Enjoy the action,
<br>
Ken
<br>

<br>
<B>Ken Brown is commentating for the BBC at Wentworth this weekend. During =
his playing career he competed in five Ryder Cups and won four times on the=
 European Tour.</b>
