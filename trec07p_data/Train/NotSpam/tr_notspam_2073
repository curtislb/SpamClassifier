To install about anything else that needs serial console, where does one end 
up getting a virtual serial port into the Windows side? I assume that a 
virtual port is needed on the host side to connect to the VM's virtual 
serial port. I would say that Minicom with Cygwin is probably the easiest 
way to deal with installations where you need to deal with the checkboxes 
and other controls in dialog boxes that come from the VM side of the 
connection.
