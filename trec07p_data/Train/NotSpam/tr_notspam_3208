3. ASSEMBLY COMPETITIONS NOW OPEN: $36,000 in prizes

Claim your piece of the $36,000 prize purse up for grabs in the Apollo Reporting System and Credit Analysis Tool assembly contests! With a two week submission period, recommended team sizes of between 2 and 4 members, these two applications are an excellent opportunity to get involved in producing top-quality software. 

About Credit Analysis Tool:
The application is a web-based .NET application and is critical to improving controls and efficiency within a leading energy services company. The Credit Analysis Tool will provide an easy-to-use application that provides a simple workflow component to the credit request and approval process. 

About Apollo Reporting System:
The Reporting System replaces a manual process whereby customers place an order for 1 or more reports, which are then written and reviewed by several internal departments before being published and/or delivered to the customer. TopCoder is helping automate this entire process with the Reporting System, which is both a web-based management interface for report order tracking and for the back-end processor.


=================================================================
4. TESTING COMPETITIONS NOW OPEN: $9,000 IN PRIZES

TopCoder is excited to announce 6 new testing competitions with $1,500 each testing competition in prize money. The testing competitions are for an Application called Site Management Console, which coordinates and organizes over 30 different event types. Together, these events describe a launch plan which drives the layout of an e-commerce site. The final application is in C# and a client Exe application.


=================================================================
5. HELP WANTED
