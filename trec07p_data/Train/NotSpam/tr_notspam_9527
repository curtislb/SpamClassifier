Just want to make sure that samples it generates are from the correct 
probability model.  I'm just used to doing this with ifelse(runif(n) <- 
plogis(population.logit)) for the binary case.

Then I wouldn't use the augmented data approach.

My suggestion doesn't handle random slopes but does handle random 
intercepts in a sense.
