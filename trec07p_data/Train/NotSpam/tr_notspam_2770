Yes, that solves my problem. I could've looked at the hold day and would
not have caught it.
I guess a hash would be more efficient, but since that's not an issue
for me at this time I'll stick with what I got.
Thanks!

You have
return = "thingy";
You want
return "thingy";

Can be shortened to:

return "Audit Volume" if ( /^AVI$/ );
return "BACKUP" if ( /^BKP$/ );

(I wonder if " if(eq /AVI/)" would work...)

You may want to consider setting up a hash and just accessing the
element.

(code untested)
%lookup = {
   BKP => "BACKUP,
   AVI => "Audit Volume"
};

Then replace the $temp_proc variable with $lookup {"AVI"}
