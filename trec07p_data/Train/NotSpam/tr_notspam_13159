Of course, but "Turing equivalence" is a really bad reason to do something 
that no one involved has any interest in doing.  I assume that the people 
working on building compiler tools in Parrot have more interest in getting 
them working with Parrot than with any other VMs.  Likewise I assume that any 
people who might have an interest in getting them working with VMs have other 
things to do, so that's why we have a few of the former and none of the 
latter.

I mean, people aren't using Parrot right now much.  I have little interest in 
doing things that make it less likely for them to use Parrot.
