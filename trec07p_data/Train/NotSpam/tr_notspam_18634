If you are trying to connect to the "telnet" server that comes with
Microsoft OSes then you are SOL.  If you are trying to connect to a
different telnet server, then please provide the name of the server
and operating system it is running under so we can duplicate your
environment.

from Perldoc Net::Telnet
       Connecting to a Remote MS-Windows Machine

       By default MS-Windows doesn't come with a TELNET server.  However third
       party TELNET servers are available.  Unfortunately many of these
       servers falsely claim to be a TELNET server.  This is especially true
       of the so-called "Microsoft Telnet Server" that comes installed with
       some newer versions MS-Windows.

       When a TELNET server first accepts a connection, it must use the ASCII
       control characters carriage-return and line-feed to start a new line
       (see RFC854).  A server like the "Microsoft Telnet Server" that doesn't
       do this, isn't a TELNET server.  These servers send ANSI terminal
       escape sequences to position to a column on a subsequent line and to
       even position while writing characters that are adjacent to each other.
       Worse, when sending output these servers resend previously sent command
       output in a misguided attempt to display an entire terminal screen.

       Connecting Net::Telnet to one of these false TELNET servers makes your
       job of parsing command output very difficult.  It's better to replace a
       false TELNET server with a real TELNET server.  The better TELNET
       servers for MS-Windows allow you to avoid the ANSI escapes by turning
       off something some of them call console mode.
