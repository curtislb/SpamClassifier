Sounds great. For me, suspend to ram failure is not very significant. If it 
should happen, the only thing that may happen is that any unsaved documents 
will be gone and programs will no longer be as they were with suspend to ram. 
That is, it would be as if I were to pull the plug from the system.

A suspend to disk failure is much worse because if the swap partition data is 
currupted before the laptop resumes, the resuming of the laptop can corrupt 
the data on the hard drive. This does not happen to suspend to ram because 
either ram resumes, fails or is wiped upon reboot (and therefore fails). This 
is why you should never suspend to disk and then try booting from another 
kernel (such as booting from a LiveCD) or device. In the LiveCD example, the 
LiveCD will boot, mount your swap and use it as its own corrupting the data 
that was saved during suspend to disk. When the computer is booted and tries 
to resume the suspend to disk from swap, all hell will break loose. This is 
my understanding after reading documentation on the different suspend 
methods.
