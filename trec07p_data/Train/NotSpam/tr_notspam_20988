Hi Birgit,

Just to add to what Gavin has said.  There are two other very powerful
packages in R that handle this kind of thing: ade4 and vegan.  Have a
thorough look at both of them.  You should be looking at Principal
Coordinate Analysis (Classical Scaling) and Non Metric Multidimensional
Scaling (NMDS)---with, as Gavin has said, your species as rows.  At least
the first of these methods goes hand-in-glove with cluster analysis.

Given that you are based in Switzerland, and perhaps are Swiss, you probably
therefore read and speak French as a second/third language.  You may
therefore find the ade4 package more useful, since its authors are French,
and its principal authors, Prof. Daniel Chessel &c., have made publicly
available some exceptionally useful documentation on these methods on their
ade4 website.  These are mainly Prof. Chessel's lecture notes:

http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/R/enseignement.html

I hope that speeds you on your way.

Regards,
Mark.

PS: Apropos of the Legendre & Legendre text: It's well worth buying if you
work in this area; one of its authors, Pierre Legendre, now collaborates
with Jari Oksanen on some functions of the vegan package.
