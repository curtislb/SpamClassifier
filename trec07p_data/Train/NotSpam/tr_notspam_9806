You may not impose any further restrictions with respect to the *rights
granted by the GPL*.  But there are already such restrictions, and you
cannot remove them because you are not the copyright holder.
Hence you cannot comply with the license and the work is
undistributable.

Please see the thread that I referenced in the footnote of my previous
message.

They can use any license they want, but if they use a self-contradicting
one, we do *not* have a valid license and the result is an
undistributable work...

The fact that a clause is *similar* to one seen in a GPLv3 draft has
*never* been a valid reason why it should be considered DFSG-free.
Please, let's avoid drifting away from the topic we are talking about:
we are trying to analyze a GPLv2 + restrictions licensing scheme.
