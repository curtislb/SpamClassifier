Yes, that's how they're implemented now. Currently, in order to use the 
common feature of overriding the vtable entry without polluting the 
namespace you have to specify ":vtable :method :anon". Which is huge 
progress over what we had before (you used to override a vtable by 
creating a .sub prefixed with "__").

I'm talking about how they will be implemented for PDD15. Methods and 
vtables will be stored separately, because it will be quite common to 
have vtable entries with no corresponding method, and methods with no 
corresponding vtable entry. The interface is intended to reflect the 
same fact.
