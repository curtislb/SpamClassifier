I assume because it's easier for someone to refer to something that 
was just written in the preceding line(s) than something that hasn't 
been written yet.  Of course, documentation is not necessary written 
in order (I too like to put docs before code), so I don't see why we 
couldn't have a code for succeeding aliases as well.
