Hi again,

In that case can use the following:
if ($dept and exists($dept->{customer}{user}){ ....}else{....}

That's the problem.  'user' isn't in the first hash.  It's in the second hash.
The hash looks like $dept{customer}{user}.  I need to skip $dept{customer} and
check for $dept{customer}{user}.
