Apple iPhone and Safari

WebMD - Health-Care Information for Everyone

The Crocs Stock Split

-----

After long and careful reflection, I've decided not to buy the Apple
iPhone on the day it first goes on sale (June 29).  For a brief time I did
imagine myself standing in line outside the Apple Store or the AT&T store
at 4 am.  Last November I stood outside a Target store on a very cold
morning with my son to get a Nintendo Wii, and standing outside in June
would be a piece of cake compared to that.  But I'm going to wait on the
iPhone.  Here's why.

One.  I'll be on vacation in Europe for half of July, and the days
following the iPhone launch will be better used in planning for that trip,
than in learning the ins and outs of a new electronic device.

Two.  By waiting a while I'll (hopefully) benefit from the fixing of bugs
found in the initial units.

And that's reason enough.  But thinking about it, I'm also reminded of
repeated studies that show that people typically overestimate the pleasure
they'll derive from new purchases.  Whether it's a cheeseburger, a new
pair of shoes or a new car, studies show that the purchase, once it is no
longer yearned for, typically fails to improve people's happiness as much
as they originally expected.

Oh, I'll still buy the iPhone later this summer.  I sincerely want a
device that will allow me to Google for answers anytime/anywhere.  I want
my contacts and calendars always synchronized.  And I want my 5000 digital
songs always available.  For me, the phone is the least important part!

But for the reasons stated above, waiting a few more weeks makes perfect
sense . . . for me.

-----

On another note, I was excited this week to read of a new wrinkle in the
Apple story that has major implications.  It's the announcement of Safari
(a web browser) for Windows.

Now, most Windows computers have Microsoft Internet Explorer (MIE) as a
web browser.  In fact, MIE has a whopping 79% of the entire web browser
market.

So why would you want to switch to Safari?  Because Safari is the web
browser that will run on the iPhone!

I already use Safari on my Mac, in part because Apple makes it, so it's
perfectly integrated.  Integration, remember, is a major reason why
Apple's products are so effective.

And I'm betting that the promise of smooth integration with their iPhones
will drive millions of users to switch from MIE to Safari.

Today the second-most popular web browser is Firefox, with a market share
of 15%.  Safari is third, with a market share of 5% (basically, all Apple
computers) and Netscape (once the king) is fourth, with a market share of
less than 1%.

I'm thinking that Safari will be second by the end of the year, and that's
a coup for Apple that no one saw coming.

As for the stock (AAPL), if you own it, hold on tight; it's zoomed 26% in
the past seven weeks.  But if you don't own it, I think there are better
risk/reward situations out there for your hard-earned money.  The biggest
risk with Apple (and I have said this before) is that it is highly loved,
and stocks tend to peak at their moment of peak love.

With luck and good management, Apple's peak is still years away, but all
things considered, I think it's smarter to buy a stock that isn't so well
loved.

To find hot stocks that aren't so well-loved, take a look at Cabot Top Ten
Report.

Top Ten's OptiMo stock picking system achieved average profits of 352% in
just 12 months.

Just look:

- Hansen Natural (HANS) up 471%
- NutriSystem (NTRI) up 485%
- Titanium Metals (TIE) up 655%
- Administaff (ASF) up 195%
- RTI Metals (RTI) up 145%
- Trident Microsystems (TRID) up 163%

If you start today, you too can capture the market's next rise.  Do this
and I guarantee that two years from today you'll be patting yourself on
the back for taking the actions I spell out today and putting your trust
in the time-proven OptiMo stock-picking system.

So here's an unloved stock to consider.  Ten days ago I wrote about our
country's twin health care problems, obesity and the rising cost of health
care, and confessed that at the time I had no investment idea that would
address the problem.

Today I have one.  It's WebMD (WBMD), the online provider of health care
information to both individuals and professionals.  Information and
education, remember, was the key to my solution to the obesity problem.

And information is what WebMD is selling (and giving away).

The company's main web site (WebMD) is aimed at consumers and provides
plain facts and sensible advice on nearly every heath topic that's on
Americans' minds.

The first page, for instance, has a list of the top 12 health topics for
men, as well as the top 122 for women and the top 12 for children.  For
men, the list reads like this: Diabetes, Athlete's Foot, Lung Cancer,
Crohn's Disease, Testicular Cancer, Cholesterol, Prostate Cancer,
Hemorrhoids, Back Pain, Adult ADHD, Sleep Problems, Melanoma.

For women: Hypothyroidism, HPV (Human Papillomavirus), Weight Loss,
Pregnancy, Bipolar Disorder, Cholesterol, Melanoma, Plantar Warts, PCOS
(Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome), Lung Cancer, Stretch Marks, Chronic
Fatigue.

There are lists of popular stories, including "22 Ways to Stop Feeling
Tired" and "Crocs: Health Shoes or Just Comfy?"

There's information on drugs, both prescription and over-the-counter. 
There are guides to healthy living.  And there are 140 moderated
discussion boards.

The company also runs a web site for health care professionals, dubbed
Medscape, which fills their information needs.  There they find 30
physician discussion boards, as well as continuing medical education (CME)
activities.

And the company runs five other web sites: MedicineNet, eMedicine,
eMedicine Health, RxList and theheart.org.

So how does WebMD make money?  Two-thirds of revenues come from
advertising, a fifth comes from licensing its content (basically providing
repurposed information on third-party web sites run by insurers and
employers), and the rest comes from publishing and other services.

Revenue trends are great; they grew at a 22% rate in 2004, a 26% rate in
2005 and a 50% rate in 2006.  In the most recent quarter, revenues grew
46% to $73.0 million!  The company lost money every year until 2004, but
annual earnings have grown every year since.  This year, analysts expect
earnings of $0.51 per share, up 42% from last year.

Long-term, it's likely these trends will continue, particularly because
baby-boomers, the bulge in the demographic python, are now entering the
years when health concerns grow.

As for the stock, WBMD came public in September 2005 at 18, hit a high of
58 in mid-April of this year, and since then has pulled back to a low of
48.  My suggestion, if you like the story and want to make a long-term
commitment in the field of health-care information, is to buy some now and
hold on patiently.

-----

My final story today concerns Crocs, the maker of funny-looking shoes that
is the biggest winner in the portfolio of Cabot Market Letter.   
It's up 167% since October, in part because of improvements in the
business but also because of improvements in investor perceptions.

Eight months ago, the idea that this maker of funny-looking shoes could
become a major player in the industry was a minority view.   
Most people saw the shoes as a fad that would soon die.  But opinions have
improved dramatically since then, and the result is a much higher stock
price.

In fact, CROX has topped $90 per share in recent days.  But after today's
close, the stock will split 2-for-1, and that's an event what I want to
talk about.

So first a review of the basics.

After the split, the stock will trade at about $45 per share, but there
will be twice as many shares (80 million).  The company will be the same,
and the company's value as determined by the market will be the same
(about $3.6 billion).

So what's the point of the split?  Crocs management does it to make the
shares more attractive to the individual investor.  And that's a common
practice.

But it's not universal.  There are two notable companies that have never
split their stocks.  One is Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA),
which now trades around $109,000 per share.  The other is Google (GOOG),
now trading just above $500.

So why haven't the managements of these two companies split their stocks? 
Because they're focused on building valuable enterprises, not on catering
to shareholders.

The downside of that is that small-time investors tend not to buy those
stocks.  The upside is that small-time investors tend not to buy those
stocks.

Double-speak?  Not really.

If you want small-time investors to buy your stock and push it up, you
split the stock to lower the price, and they happily climb on board.  But
small-time investors are notorious for their poor timing.

In a bull market, they will be among the last to buy, and thus be most
instrumental in pushing a stock to its ultimate peak.

And in a bear market, they will be among the last to sell, and thus be the
greatest factor in pushing a stock down to its ultimate lows.

By effectively excluding amateur investors from their stocks, the
managements of Berkshire Hathaway and Google are choosing a less volatile
future for their stocks, and that's a good thing for managements and
shareholders who are focused on the long term.

In fact, I respect the guys at Google for emulating the wise Mr. Buffett
in this regard.

But the custom of our times is to split a stock before it gets to 100, and
Crocs management is following the custom.

What investors want to know today, of course, is if the split means the
stock is a good buy . . . and there's no simple answer to that.

The split, like almost all splits, comes after the stock has had a
substantial rise; CROX is up 326% since its February 2006 IPO and up 107%
in the past three months.  We know that momentum does tend to persist, but
also that substantial corrections can interrupt these trends, especially
when the gains have been fueled, in part, by short-covering and that fuel
source runs low.

History does tell us that sometimes, splits mark the top for stocks.   
In essence, the increased supply of shares fills (or exceeds) the market's
demand, and when supply exceeds demand, prices fall.

Usually however, those tops come not on the first split (this is the first
for CROX), but on the second or third, so that's not a big concern.

For the final word, we look to the chart.  It's strong, and thus due for a
pullback at some point, but the buying volume has been increasing in
recent days and that's a good thing.

But the stock is 11% above its 25-day moving average and 31% above its
50-day moving average, and thus anyone buying here risks a drop down to
those averages . . . which could be painful.

Bottom line.  If you own CROX, hold it, and if you don't own it yet, try
to become a shareholder at a low-risk entry point.  We still think the
long-term prospects for the company are terrific, but are leery of the
stock's potential for downside action in the days and weeks following the
split.
