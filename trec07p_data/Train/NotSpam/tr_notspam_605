08:00 p.m., 04/10/07, Update: NASA hopes to launch Atlantis, with repaired =
fuel tank, around June 8=20

Launch of the shuttle Atlantis on a hail-delayed flight to the internationa=
l space station is slipping to no earlier than June 8, officials said today=
, to give engineers more time to repair damaged foam insulation on the ship=
's external fuel tank.

The decision was made after assessing the progress of repairs to date and e=
xtensive testing and analysis to evaluate how those repairs will stand up t=
o the thermal and aerodynamic rigors of launch. While agency managers were =
forced to give up any hope of launching before the May 21 end of the curren=
t launch window, the assessment showed it made more sense to stick with the=
 current tank and launch in early June than it did to switch to a new tank.

"If we continue at this pace of repair, we should be looking at a vehicle r=
ollout to the launch pad perhaps as early as May 6 and launch that would co=
me ... no earlier than June the 8th," said shuttle Program Manager Wayne Ha=
le. "What we're doing, of course, is letting the work drive the schedule in=
stead of the other way around. We are proceeding with a great deal of cauti=
on."

Hale said NASA hopes to launch the shuttle Endeavour on the next flight in =
the sequence as early as Aug. 5 and, if no major problems develop, two more=
 flights in October and December.

"We sent out the potential manifest to review to all the parts of the shutt=
le program," Hale said. "We are going to come back Monday afternoon, April =
16, and review what people think of that. But I will tell you it depends en=
tirely on when we get done with these ET repairs and launch STS-117. I mean=
, that's the first part of flying the rest of the flights this year. I woul=
d tell you that flying four flights is not outside the realm of possibility=
, but we want to do this in a safe and orderly manner and we'll just see ho=
w it works out."

NASA managers had hoped to launch Atlantis on mission STS-117, the first of=
 five planned 2007 shuttle missions, March 15. But during a freak storm tha=
t thundered over pad 39A on Feb. 26, the shuttle's external tank was blaste=
d by hail, suffering thousands of pits and gouges in its foam insulation. W=
ind gusts reached 62 knots and hail up to 1.5 inches in diameter was found =
at the pad.

Atlantis, shielded by moveable weather protection panels, was unscathed. Bu=
t NASA managers ultimately decided to move the shuttle back to the Vehicle =
Assembly Building for detailed inspections and, if possible, repairs.

As it turned out, most of the damage was restricted to the upper liquid oxy=
gen section of Atlantis's tank. Only a handful of dings were found lower do=
wn on the hydrogen section and while two dozen heat shield tiles on the orb=
iter were scraped by hail that worked its way behind the weather protection=
 panels, detailed inspections show the ship's critical carbon composite win=
g leading edge panels and nose cap were undamaged.

John Honeycutt, deputy manager of the external tank project, said today som=
e 2,664 areas of damage requiring repair have been identified. Two areas, o=
ne near the tip of the tank that had between 1,000 and 1,600 hits and the o=
ther lower down on the side of the oxygen tank with 200 or so tightly packe=
d impact sites, were so heavily pitted that engineers opted against individ=
ual repairs.

Instead, the damaged foam will be sanded down and fresh insulation will be =
sprayed on by tank engineers. About 700 dings and pits will be fixed by bor=
ing them out and pouring in fresh foam. Honeycutt said about half of those =
repairs have been completed to date. The remainder of the damage will be fi=
xed by so-called "sand-and-blend" techniques or simply flying as is.

Foam sprays normally are carried out robotically at Lockheed Martin's Micho=
ud Assembly Facility in New Orleans. The repair sprays will use a different=
 type of foam and it will be applied manually. These are "non-standard" rep=
airs and extensive testing was ordered to make sure the foam will provide t=
he proper pre-launch insulation and also stand up to the rigors of launch w=
ithout shedding any debris that could damage the shuttle's heat shield.

Today, managers concluded the engineering team has a reasonable chance of c=
ompleting the repairs and getting Atlantis off around June 8. Hale said rec=
ently ordered inspections of the shuttle's main propulsion system fuel line=
s will be completed under the umbrella of the external tank work.

"The repairs as they're tracking today, leading to a rollout about the fift=
h or sixth of May - and again, that's going to depend on how we do with the=
 repairs - but assuming we get out then, we could not launch within the May=
 window, which closes on May 21," Hale said. "That pushes us into the June =
8 window.

"If we were to decide today to switch to the new tank (slated for use by En=
deavour) we could launch no earlier than June 19. ... We'd like to avoid ..=
. all the effort that's involved in switching tanks. So as long as we're on=
 a good path to repair the hail-damaged tank, we should stay with it."

Assuming the repair work goes as planned and the ongoing analysis shows the=
 repairs will, in fact, be safe, liftoff of STS-117 will be targeted for ar=
ound 7:34 p.m. on June 8. If that schedule holds up, the shuttle would dock=
 with the international space station June 10, spacewalks would be carried =
out June 11, 13 and 15, with landing on tap the afternoon of June 19. Launc=
h times for subsequent days in June are posted on the CBS News STS-117 Quic=
k-Look page:

http://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/currentglance.html

The shuttle Endeavour, which had been scheduled for launch in June, will in=
stead slip to around Aug. 5.

Endeavour's crew includes teacher-astronaut Barbara Morgan and Clay Anderso=
n, who will replace station crew member Sunita Williams. Williams was launc=
hed to the outpost Dec. 9 aboard the shuttle Discovery and if she remains i=
n space until mid August, she will set a new U.S. single-flight duration re=
cord of some 250 days.

Bill Gerstenmaier, NASA's chief of manned spaceflight operations, said toda=
y NASA is looking at what might be needed to rotate Williams home early abo=
ard Atlantis if the flight faces any additional delays. But barring major p=
roblems, he said, she will come home as planned aboard Endeavour.

For her part, Williams said today she was not overly concerned about increa=
sed exposure to space radiation or any other aspects of a longer-than-plann=
ed stay in space.

"Well, you know, I've been in constant contact with my flight surgeon and h=
e's keeping me up to date on the concerns we have," she told reporters duri=
ng a news conference earlier today. "I think eight months is fine from all =
the indications I've heard, we're at a time right now where we're not getti=
ng too much extra radiation from activity on the sun. So I think right now,=
 all indications say that's no problem."

Williams' current crewmates - Expedition 14 commander Mike Lopez-Alegria an=
d flight engineer Mikhail Tyurin - are scheduled to return to Earth April 2=
0, along with U.S. space tourist Charles Simonyi, aboard a Russian Soyuz sp=
acecraft. Lopez-Alegria and Tyurin were launched Sept. 18 and on landing, L=
opez-Alegria will set a new U.S. single-flight endurance record of 214 days.

Launch dates for downstream shuttle flights are still under discussion and =
will be assessed during a shuttle/station management review April 16.

But a proposed manifest change would move the third flight in the sequence =
to just after a Russian Soyuz flight in mid October and delay a high-profil=
e flight to launch the European Space Agency's Columbus module to early Dec=
ember. Again, those dates will require agreement by shuttle and station man=
agers.

In the meantime, Hale said, Atlantis's crew remains in good spirits. Moving=
 the flight to June 8 means what had been a deep overnight mission will ins=
tead be conducted during afternoon and evening hours U.S. time. Here is a s=
ummary timeline (in mission elapsed time and EDT). A more detailed flight p=
lan is posted on the Quick-Look page.

Launch dates for downstream shuttle flights are still under discussion and =
will be assessed during a shuttle/station management review April 16.<BR>
<BR>
But a proposed manifest change would move the third flight in the sequence =
to just after a Russian Soyuz flight in mid October and delay a high-profil=
e flight to launch the European Space Agency's Columbus module to early Dec=
ember. Again, those dates will require agreement by shuttle and station man=
agers.<BR>
<BR>
In the meantime, Hale said, Atlantis's crew remains in good spirits. Moving=
 the flight to June 8 means what had been a deep overnight mission will ins=
tead be conducted during afternoon and evening hours U.S. time. Here is a s=
ummary timeline (in mission elapsed time and EDT). A more detailed flight p=
lan is posted on the Quick-Look page.<BR>
