I would like to ask everyone on the list to raise a cheer for yet =20
another multinational capitalist corporation's co-option of the free =20
culture movement. Truly the valorization of the hard-earned work of =20
millions of unpaid, free creators across the world should be =20
celebrated for contributing yet again to the profit margins of the =20
world largest, richest and most powerful corporations. Today should =20
be recognised as a breakthough for creative commons moving from a =20
grass-roots organisation committed to the creativity of everyone, to =20
becoming the trusted advisor and advocate to capital for implementing =20=

a new form of IP policy that encourages 'sharing' --- well, sharing =20
as long as it is the output of *us*, rather than anything that the =20
multinational might produce (then clearly it is criminal and it is =20
piracy).

Hurrah for SONY DAY!

(One can only hope that one day, in the future, everyday will be =20
named after a giant multinational corporation!)
