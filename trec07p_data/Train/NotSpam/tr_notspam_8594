I run SpamAssassin on a RHEL 4 box with the FuzzyOCR plugin. This
combonation was sending errors to my log files so often that my server
slowed down. Follow up on the cause revealed an upgrade to 5.8.8 would
correct the problem.

Unfortuantly I've spent a few days cleaning up the aftermath of the
problems that were created. I'm not stuck with a few problems I can't seem
to find the answer to. I'm hoping someone here can help me out because I'm
not to up on perl yet.

Anyway, what I did was remove the current installation of perl using the
rpm command to erase it. Since it complained about dependants and I was
about to re-install it I used the nodeps option.

Then I installed perl 5.8.8 and re-installed my modules that I use.
Specifically SpamAssassin. When I try to run spamd I get this error now:
[root@avas ~]# /etc/init.d/spamassassin start
Starting spamd: Can't locate object method "register_domain" via package
"IO::Socket::INET" at
/usr/local/lib/perl5/5.8.8/i686-linux/IO/Socket/INET.pm line 22.
Compilation failed in require at /usr/bin/spamd line 44.
BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at /usr/bin/spamd line 79.
                                                           [FAILED]
The INET installed went in with no problem and is:
cpan[12]> install IO::Socket::INET
IO::Socket::INET is up to date (1.31).

My web server could not start until I commented out the following line:
#LoadModule perl_module modules/mod_perl.so

The error I get with that active is:
May  8 10:24:04 avas httpd: Syntax error on line 26 of
/etc/httpd/conf.d/perl.conf:
May  8 10:24:04 avas httpd: Invalid command 'PerlTaintCheck', perhaps
mis-spelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration
May  8 10:24:04 avas httpd: httpd startup failed

mod_perl.so existed in the /etc/httpd/modules directory but foolishly I
deleted it thinking that re-installing the mod_perl package would bring
back the correct one. Nope - that was wrong.

So, now I don't have a mod_perl for apache and my spamassassin won't run
because of some strange perl error.

Can someone shed some light on this for me... What should I do now?
