It would seem to me that a preprocessor, written in perl of course, could easily respond to "DIMENSION noun AS double" statements or whatever you like by adding the appropriate sigl every the noun appears without it.

As for "too late" I do have a problem. I started with perl 4 or so as MacPerl with Apple's MPW as a shell. Now, at age 72, I do worry that perl 6 may be too late for me. It's been two years since I got to the point of using the * sigl in perl 5 and I still have a lot to learn about that.

FORTRAN forever.
