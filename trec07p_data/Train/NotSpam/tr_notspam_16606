Indeed: see the last sentence of

Agreed.

Long-lasting debian-legal discussions about the GFDL went on during
2003.
They were basically over in 2004.
Manoj Srivastava's proposed statement was drafted more or less in that
period, IIRC:
http://people.debian.org/%7Esrivasta/Position_Statement.xhtml

The Debian Social Contract was edited in 2004, in order to make it
clearer that not only programs had to be free:
http://www.debian.org/vote/2004/vote_003
Then the new amended SC text was postponed until the release of sarge:
http://www.debian.org/vote/2004/vote_004
All non-free documentation bugs were granted a sarge-ignore tag.
After sarge release (6th of June, 2005:
http://www.debian.org/releases/sarge/), the non-free documentation bugs
slowly started to be addressed.

In some cases, Debian was even told to stop helping:
