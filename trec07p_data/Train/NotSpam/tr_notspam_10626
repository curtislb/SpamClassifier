TONIGHT ON SHOWBIZ TONIGHT- CNN HEADLINE PRIME 11pm ET/ 11pm PT

<b>PARIS HILTON AND JOE FRANCIS GONE WILD!</b>
Two big stars, one sad connection: jail time! Both Paris Hilton and "Girls Gone Wild" guru Joe Francis say they're traumatized by their sentences -- the word "suicide" is even being used! Are they just emotional wrecks, or trying to get out of the long arm of the law? The inside story, tonight on TV's most provocative entertainment news show.

<b>CELEBRITY SEX TAPES!</b>
>From Pamela Anderson to Paris Hilton, Kid Rock to Screech (yuck!), star after star has shown up in videotapes of behind-closed-doors bedroom antics. When the tapes are released, does it help or hurt stars' careers? And are some just doing it for the publicity?

<b>ANNA NICOLE SMITH – THE WILL</b>
Anna Nicole Smith's will has been filed -- and there are some major surprises, including how <i>little</i> money the bombshell actually had to her name. So how much money are we talking about? What happens now? Who gets the money? Showbiz Tonight goes looking for answers, tonight.

<b>SHOWBIZ TONIGHT QUESTION OF THE DAY:</b>
Paris Hilton claims "trauma": Do you feel sorry for her?
