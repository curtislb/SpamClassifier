Poor marks?
It's not the most user-friendly tool to use, as it requires a little  
bit of learning[*]... but I find that there's a lot of very useful  
information if you care to look for it and read it. What you can't do  
is just type stuff at random and be annoyed that R doesn't understand  
what you mean.

[*] don't you have to learn how to use _any_ tool, anyway?

The "Introduction to R" included by default as a pdf with the RGui  
installation (and accessible via its Help menu) is a very useful  
introduction to R (surprise!). I'd recommend starting with that,  
before despairing. There are tons of useful R documentation all over...
