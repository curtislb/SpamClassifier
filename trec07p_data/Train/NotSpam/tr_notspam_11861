I haven't followed the discussion from the beginning but,  
independently of R, some image formats support transparency while  
others don't. PDF supports transparency but EPS and PS don't. So you  
can't expect R's postscript() device to support it (and you will  
loose it when converting a pdf to and eps or a ps file). SVG support  
transparency beautifully and you'll be able to edit it with Inkscape  
(which is cross platform). R can produce SVG thrhough the package  
RSvgDevice.
Furthermore, if you open a PDF (or any vector based format such as  
EPS or PS) with Gimp it will "rasterize" it: convert the vector  
information to pixels. You'll be able to save it to many formats but  
it will still be pixel based (zooming on it will reveal pixels while  
it's not true with vector based formats).

Hope that helps.
