Dunno what UK law actually is on this, but I'd say this was *very* 
unfree.

While our system has a strong "loser pays" *presumption*, we regularly 
have cases where it ends up "winner pays"!

You would probably find this is unenforceable in the UK, and even if the 
choice of *law* was "US law", a UK court probably would award costs 
against the winner if that was normal UK procedure.

(This situation normally arises when a defendant tries to settle, and in 
the end a trial awards lesser damages than the defendant's offer to 
settle. This has been known to bankrupt plaintiffs on occasion...)

Cheers,
Wol
