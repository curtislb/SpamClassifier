I very much suspect that the spam you are receiving comes not from this
list, but directly to the address you use (exclusively?) for this list.
There is very little (read nothing) the list manager can do about this.
You have effectively publicised an email address to the world, and the
spammers have found it.

Might I suggest you install spamassassin, which I have found to be very
good at all but eliminating the spam which ends up in my inbox.  (It's
also written in perl.)  I also recommend procmail.  It would probably be
fairly simple to create a rule to drop all mail to the address you use
here unless it has actually come from the list.

Spam is a problem.  It is not going away in the near future.  I think
you'll find life much easier if you can find a (partial) solution to the
problem.  I'm sure you receive spam on other addresses you use too.
I use my real mail address for everything and receive oodles of spam,
but spamassassin and procmail do an acceptable job for me.
