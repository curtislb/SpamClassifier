	Ayn Rand claimed to base her philosophical system on three
	``axioms'':  (1) Existence exists.  (2) Conciousness is
	concious.  (3) [I can't --- thank God --- remember.]

	When I was in graduate school, lo these many years ago, I had
	a friend who was a very right-wing person from the South of
	the U. S. and who might have been expected to have some
	sympathy with Ayn Rand's views.  This friend had a gift for
	succinct and pithy aphorisms.  He remarked:  ``Anyone who can
	say `Existence exists' with a straight face is either a fool
	or a charlatan.''

                                cheers,
