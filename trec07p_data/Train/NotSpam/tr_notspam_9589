Then use the Linux CIFSFS client that understands symlinks and
will report them (and create them) in exactly the same way as
a local filesystem.

It's only a Windows client that can't see these things, as we
can't know what they map to. The codepath in question is only
taken when doing a Windows qfileinfo - on a UNIX qfileinfo
we correctly return a symlink.
