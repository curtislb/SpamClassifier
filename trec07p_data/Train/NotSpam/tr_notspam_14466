Well, yes, "Everything is an Object" is the politically correct mantra.  :)

And in Perl 6, "Any" does not really mean "any kind of whatever".
"Any" is just short for "any single bindable item", and a Junction is
not a single bindable item, since it autothreads instead.  Note that
"any" is considered a singular noun in English, and so used in
junctional phrases like "any of A, B, or C", where it picks out
one or another of them semantically, which is basically the same
operation that autothreading a parameter does.  We're using "any"
more in that "any of a restricted set" sense than in the "any of
the universal set" sense.

So I'm not too worried about the counterintuitiveness of it, by and
large.  It's much like that little embarrassing problem in physics
that a GUT is neither as grand nor as unified as a TOE. :)

In any case, the Huffman coding is probably right because you want
to declare Any parameters more often than you want to talk about any
possible kind of Object, I suspect.

Hmm, maybe we should just rename Object to something more generic.
There are plenty of candidates:

    Top
    Idea
    Noun
    Item
    Proto
    Thing
    Notion
    Concept
    Subject
    Reality
    Invocant
    Universal
    EveryThing
    Abstraction
    TheCosmicAll
    Life::Universe::Everything
