Wow, thanks to everyone who replied. I did read something about yasr 
beeing used on bsd and linux but only played with it once on a debian 
build, and, then whent over to speakup when I found out about it. I 
am still really new to anything unix related but figured it was a 
good question and that this was a good place to ask. Hope everyone is 
well and thanks again for the answer.
