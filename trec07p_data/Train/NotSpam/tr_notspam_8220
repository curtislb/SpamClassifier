Hi to the list,
I did ping 127.0.0.1 though I knew that wasn't of any real help.  No, I 
never get to the dhcp server.  It tells me that the link is missing.  The 
regular rtl8139 module 8139too is loaded.  I can't even ping my regular 
router.  It thinks there is no cable.  However, the WINDOWS machine works 
fine.
