Lou Dobbs Tonight
Wednesday, May 23, 2007

Tonight, Why amnesty?  Why not border security? The United
States’ government's failure to enforce our immigration laws
has led to a national crisis.

As the Senate’s debate on the comprehensive amnesty bill
continues, we’ll follow legislators’ arguments and votes.

Supporters of the Senate’s immigration compromise have set up a
false choice between mass deportations and full amnesty for
illegal aliens.  In fact, whole sections of the Senate proposal
are already law. We’ll have a special report on the failure of
our government to secure the border and enforce our current
laws.

The comprehensive amnesty bill now being entertained puts a
premium on valid IDs over fake ones, because the current system
for checking IDs allows fraudulent documents to easily slip
through. Fake IDs will be reason for an illegal alien being
banned but many illegal aliens have been able to live and work
using them. Immigration experts say the bill could create a
massive market for stolen identification because they will not
alert immigration authorities when scanned. We’ll have full
coverage.

A Grand Jury in Orange County, California is urging their large
cities to support a program that identifies illegal aliens in
their jails. The grand jury proposed that Immigration and
Customs Enforcement train officers to check the immigration
status of inmates. But the proposal is facing opposition from
some police chiefs who say it would only duplicate the work of
county jails. We’ll have a special report.

Senator Jeff Sessions (R-Alabama) is leading the fight against
the Senate's amnesty legislation. He says the American people
were not represented in the Senate's deliberations on
immigration reform. The Senator joins Lou.

And, Senator Byron Dorgan (D-North Dakota) tried and failed to
strip the guest worker program from the Senate's illegal
immigration legislation. The Senator joins Lou to discuss what
this defeat could mean for America’s working men and women.

latest commentary on how our leaders are not honoring the basic

Business, and Special Interest Groups Are Waging War on the
American Dream and How to Fight Back.” War on the Middle Class
