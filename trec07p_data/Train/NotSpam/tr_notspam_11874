Actually, whilst porting my patch to SAMBA_3_0 I noticed
this wasn't being done correctly in that branch due to
the blocking timeouts being done entirely by events.

The patch I'm checking in will fix this with a 10sec
timeout for both the SAMBA_3_0 event based code and
the SAMBA_3_0_25/26 select based code.
