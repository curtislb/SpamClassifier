IRS e-News for Small Businesses

1. IRS Clarifies Form 2290 Issue
2. Self-Employment Tax Topics on IRS.gov

1. IRS Clarifies Form 2290 Issue

The IRS has received several inquiries about Form 2290 http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f2290.pdf , Heavy Highway Vehicle Use Tax, in the case of vehicles used and subsequently sold in the same tax period of July 1 through June 30. 

The person acquiring the vehicle during the tax period is required to report and pay the tax due for the remaining months of the tax period and is not required to provide the previous owner's Schedule 1 to the IRS. 

The current owner's receipted Schedule 1 is used as proof of payment when registering a vehicle with the State.

2. Self-Employment Tax Topics on IRS.gov

IRS.gov http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=98846,00.html  covers self-employment tax topics, including:

--What is self-employment tax?
--How to pay self-employment tax
--Estimated taxes
--Who must pay self-employment tax
--Are you self-employed?


3. Do You Know How to Claim Business Mileage for Business Use of Your Vehicle?

There are two methods for claiming business car expenses: actual expenses or the standard mileage rate.  http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=105708,00.html

Both begin with complete and accurate mileage records such as a written travel log for each business use of your car or truck. 

You can use the records to compute the percentage of business use and apply that against the total car operating expenses for the year.

Or, you can use the records to compute the deduction using the standard mileage rate. The 2007 standard mileage rate for the use of a car (including vans, pickups, or panel trucks) is 48.5 cents per mile for business miles driven.

If you do not have a clear and accurate business mileage record, the IRS may disallow the deduction.

4. New Publication for Green Card Holders Explains U. S. Taxes

Publication 4588 (Basic Tax for Green Card Holders Guide) http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4588.pdf   addresses the tax issues of resident aliens (Green Card Holders). 

Resident aliens are lawful permanent residents of the U.S., are treated as U.S. residents for income tax purposes and, with certain exceptions, pay tax on worldwide income, no matter what the source.

5. Tax Relief in Disaster Situations

No one wants to experience a disaster, such as the recent Kansas tornado, but worse than a disaster is not being prepared for one. 

Special tax law provisions http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=108362,00.html may help taxpayers recover financially from the impact of a disaster, especially when the President declares their location to be a major disaster area. 

IRS offers several publications to help you understand the tax relief available in disaster situations:
Publication 2194B, Disaster Losses Kit for Businesses http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p2194b.pdf 
Publication 584B, Business Casualty, Disaster, and Theft Loss Workbook http://www.irs.gov/publications/p584b/index.html 
Publication 547, Casualties, Disasters and Thefts  http://www.irs.gov/publications/p547/index.html 


6. Recent IRS Announcements for Small Businesses

IRS Draft Form 1120-F and New Schedule M-3 (1120-F) Now Available for Public Comment http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=169841,00.html 
New Electronic Filing Requirement for Small Tax-Exempt Organizations
