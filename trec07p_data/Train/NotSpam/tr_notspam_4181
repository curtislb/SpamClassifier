Personally, I don't see "distributing non-modifiable license texts" to
be "violating the social contract". I don't think anyone ever will
consider that to be the case, either.

Like people have said before: this is pointless nitpicking. I hope this
never gets to vote; I don't want to be considered part of a bunch of
crazy fanatics, which is exactly what we'll be if it does.
