All this was done via the Debian installer, correct?

Also, you opted to have just one real partition, where everything is encrypted 
even /boot? So I take it you use a USB dongle to boot your system initially?

Or did you mean having /boot as normal and / as encrypted via LUKS then LVM2 
on top of /, with logical partitions within the LVM2. To put it visually:
/boot (normal)
/root (LUKS) -> LVM2 -> multiple parition

Thank you again for all of your insight.
