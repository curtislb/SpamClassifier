Slackware 11.0 has 2.6.x kernels in the 'extra' directory tree.  The
work on the next release seems to be exclusively with 2.6.x kernels,
but I can not guess when the next release will take place.  I have not
had much trouble compiling programs in Slackware, but I have found
that Slackware already includes most of what I need straight off of
the shelf--I have not added much to it at all.  Perhaps the next
Slackware release will suit your needs better.  Others here can
comment on their favorite distributions.

HTH, and have a great day.
