<B>Coming up this Sunday on a Special Edition of Reliable Sources:</B>

<B>AFTER IMUS: THE MEDIA FALLOUT</B>

NBC and CBS pull the plug on Don Imus... we'll look at the controversy from every angle with Chicago Tribune Columnist Clarence Page, who in 2001 led Don Imus in an on-air pledge to avoid racial and gender stereotypes; Callie Crossley, media commentator for WGBH's Beat the Press; ex-Wonkette Ana Mudle Cox, a frequent Imus guest who's changed her mind about the host; and ESPN host/Washington Post sportswriter Tony Kornheiser.

<B>Behind the Scenes</B>

Why did NBC News decide to stop the simulcast of "Imus in the Morning?"  We'll ask Nightly News correspondent Ron Allen.

<B>Double Standard?</B>

How do Imus' comments compare to other pollution in pop culture, including rap, TV, and movies?  St. Petersburg Times media critic Eric Deggans and former BET Program Director Paul Porter talk about the negative images and messages rampant in other forms of media.

<B>A New Era in PC-ness?</B>

Radio personalities Stephanie Miller and Roland Martin weigh in on what's okay, and not okay, to say on the air... where's the line?

<B>Plus,</B> Imus wasn't the only racially-charged story in the news this week. The three Duke lacrosse players accused of raping an African-American woman a year ago were officially declared innocent this week by the North Carolina Attorney General. We'll take a look at why the press owes them an apology.

Join us this Sunday and every Sunday at 10am ET / 7am PT for our critical look at the media!
