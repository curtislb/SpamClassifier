Lou Dobbs Tonight
Monday, May 21, 2007

Tonight, opposition is rising in the Senate towards the Bush
administration’s amnesty agenda. Several lawmakers have yet to
see the complete bill and want to know the exact dollar amount
the legislation would place on U.S. taxpayers. Today, Senators
Jeff Sessions (R-Alabama), Jim Bunning (R-Kentucky), and Rep.
Brian Bilbray (R-California) were criticizing the bill and
demanding to know the details.

Business groups oppose the amnesty plan as well. They claim it
will not bring enough low or highly skilled labor to the United
States. And, illegal alien amnesty supporters say the plan
isn’t generous enough to the families of illegal aliens. Join
us tonight, we’ll be examining the full range of groups who
oppose the Senate’s amnesty plan.

Violence on the U.S. Mexico border continues. Just this
weekend, three police officers, including two police
commanders, were murdered in Mexico. A police commander and
another police officer were gunned down in Monterrey, Mexico
just hours after another police commander was killed in San
Nicolas de los Garza. Mexican drug cartels, retaliating against
Mexican President Felipe Calderon’s crackdown on drugs, are
suspected for the killings.  We’ll have full coverage.

There is a growing movement in Congress to pushback on China’s
unfair trade practices. The Non-Market Economy Trade Remedy
Act, or H.R. 1229, was introduced by Reps. Arthur Davis
(D-Alabama) and Phil English (R-Pennsylvania). If passed, the
bill would apply countervailing duties to non-market economies
that subsidize their industries while injuring the U.S.
economy. We’ll have a full report.

Then, powerful Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee,
Charlie Rangel, joins Lou to discuss the Democrats deal with
the Bush Administration to pass two new trade agreements.
