   This is a discussion most teams have every few years, as it's
something of a trade-off (:-))

   If you put everything in an include.h file, you'll pay the
price in compile speed, unless your compiler has a specific
mechanism (kludge?) to deal with them like precompiled headers.
You'll also detect any contradictions still present in vendor
include files (;-))

   If you don't include the kitchen sink, you'll find .h's missing
during development, just after you've added a call to something.
Over time you'll also collect no-longer-needed headers, unless
(like gcc -MMD) you have a compiler has a specific mechanism to
tell you what includes you need.

   A customer of mine now occasionally uses -MMD, .d files and a
script to prune out extra #include files when they're using gcc,
and lint|grep "unneeded" when they're using a vendor compiler.
