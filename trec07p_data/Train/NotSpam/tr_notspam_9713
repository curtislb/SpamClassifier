20 million yen Guarneri violin stolen from exhibition center in Shizuoka

SHIZUOKA -- An antique violin worth 20 million yen has been stolen from 
an exhibition center here, local police said.

The violin, a Guarneri, was one of about 80 string instruments on 
display for sale at the Twin Messe Shizuoka exhibition center in 
Suruga-ku, Shizuoka.

A center employee found the violin discovered the theft at about 7:30 
p.m. on Friday. Police suspect that someone stole the violin sometime 
between 5:15 p.m. and 6 p.m., while the center was still open.

The exhibition was organized by a Nagoya-based musical instrument 
retailer. (Mainichi)

  Police recover stolen painting by renowned Hungarian artist

By: *All Hungary News <http://www.caboodle.hu/index.php?id=103>*
2007-05-11 11:50:00


      The K?roly Lotz "Allegory of Music" painting, stolen from the home
      of an elderly woman in April along with two other valuable
      paintings, has finally turned up, reports index.hu.

The paintings were taken from the woman's aparment in God, Hungary, 
about 20 minutes outside Budapest, by two men.

Police have identified Istv?n Lakatos as one of the suspects and have 
issued a warrant for his arrest. The 36-year-old Budapest man has been 
to court several times before on similar charges.

When the woman realized she was being robbed, she ran into the street 
calling for help. It was at this point the suspects unhooked three 
paintings from her wall and took off with them.

Lotz (1833-1904) is perhaps best known for painting the mural that 
adorns the ceiling of the Hungarian State Opera House.
 

Police are still looking for Lakatos' partner.
