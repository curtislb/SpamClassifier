Hello Michael,

You can now set the volume for Speech Dispatcher in Orca preferences. 
If it doesn't work for you, get a newer version of Orca from SVN.

The volume for speakup can be set in Speech Dispatcher's configuration 
files.  Just put the following line to the end of your 
/etc/speech-dispatcher/speechd.conf:

Include "clients/speechd-up.conf"

And create the file /etc/speech-dispatcher/clients/spechd-up.conf as 
follows:

# Local configuration for speechd-up
BeginClient "*:speakup:*"
         DefaultPunctuationMode "some"
	#DefaultLanguage "en"
	DefaultRate 80
	DefaultVolume -10
	DefaultPitch 40
EndClient

Of course, set the values according to your preference.

Hope it helps

Tomas
