snip

If both the xml and xsl files exist and are readable to the user who
is running the Perl script then the next step I would take would be to
simplify the problem by moving the files to the current directory and
removing the paths like this:

my $source    = $parser->parse_file('epace.xconf');
my $style_doc = $parser->parse_file("epace-to-twiki.xsl");

If the problem persisted then I would double check and triple check
the permissions.  If I was still convinced that I should be able to
read the files then I would write a quick Perl script to try to open
and read the first line out of each file.  If that worked, but the
parser code didn't, well, I don't know what I would do.  Maybe check
to see if there is some weird ACL stuff going on.
