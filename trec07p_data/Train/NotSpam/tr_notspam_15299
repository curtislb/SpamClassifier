That could be simplified to:

@store = $str =~ /once/g;

A newline in a string is just a character like any other character, there is
nothing special about it.

/g says to match as many times as possible.  /m says that ^ will match at
the beginning of a line instead of at the beginning of a string and $ will
match at the end of a line instead of at the end of a string but you are
not using either ^ or $ in your pattern.

> Also when I replace /g with /s, I still get output "once"

/s says that the special character class . will match a newline which it
normally doesn't but you are not using . in your pattern.
