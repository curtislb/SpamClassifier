Lilly money follows power shift to Dems
Political contributions to Congress, for now, tilt against company's
GOP-heavy pattern
By Maureen Groppe
Star Washington Bureau
May 29, 2007

WASHINGTON -- A Democratic senator who wants to control drug prices
through generic competition and re-importation of prescriptions from
Canada is not the most likely recipient of campaign contributions
from the pharmaceutical industry.

But when voters switched congressional majorities from Republican to
Democrat, Eli Lilly and Co. followed suit.

Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who has not gotten campaign support from
Lilly in at least a decade, received $1,000 from the pharmaceutical
giant's political action committee in March.

The contribution was part of what could be a temporary shift for a
company that has traditionally given more to congressional
Republicans than Democrats. For the first four months of this year,
Lilly gave slightly more money to congressional Democrats ($29,500)
than to Republicans ($28,500).

Since at least 1980, at least 65 percent of Lilly's political action
committee contributions have gone to Republicans, according to
PoliticalMoneyLine, a nonpartisan company that tracks campaign
donations.

Lilly is a major donor, making more than $50,000 in contributions
during the 2006 election cycle, the fourth-highest among corporate
health-care PACs, according to PoliticalMoneyLine.

An early shift in contributions to favor the party in power is not
uncommon, and Lilly expects to end up giving more to Republicans than
to Democrats when contributions for the full, two-year election cycle
for 2008 are in, said Joe Kelley, Lilly's vice president of
government affairs.

But, he said, "There are some changes that we made to recognize and
be realistic about the fact that you've got a new group that are in
town that are running things."

Leahy now heads the Senate committee that is rewriting patent laws,
which protect Lilly's research and development work.

Capital on Capitol Hill

Pharmaceutical industry critics long have argued that heavy spending
on lobbyists and campaign contributions is a big reason Lilly and
other drug companies have gotten much of what they've sought in
Congress in recent years.

That reputation will be put to the test this year under a busy agenda
caused in part by the Democratic takeover of Congress. Several
pending issues could affect the bottom line of one of Indiana's most
important companies while also reducing drug prices for consumers.

The early scorecard is mixed.

Lilly has won some battles, as efforts failed to allow drug
importation and require the government to negotiate with the industry
for lower Medicare drug prices.

But it lost when the government revised pending trade agreements to
go further in enabling generic competition in developing countries.

And a proposal that would open up biological drugs to generic
competition has a good chance of becoming law. Such drugs, which
represented 25 percent of Lilly's sales last year, are exempt from
competition that's allowed with traditional chemical compounds, such
as Prozac.

Heavy lobbying

The pharmaceutical and health-products industry has spent more on
lobbying Washington -- $1.1 billion -- since 1998 than any other
industry, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

The intense lobbying represents the rising role prescription drugs
are playing in health care, as well as their rising cost.

"For almost 20 years, they've been among America's most profitable
industries," said Bill Vaughn, senior policy analyst for health at
the Consumers Union.

The $3.7 million Lilly reported spending on lobbying last year was
the 11th-highest amount reported by the dozens of companies, trade
associations and advocacy groups related to the industry.

Lilly won't have to report on its lobbying spending for this year
until August. But Lilly has 40 lobbyists in its stable, and three new
outside firms have already registered to lobby for the company.

"It's the busiest I've ever seen it," Jay Bonitt, Lilly's director of
government affairs, said of the activity on Capitol Hill this year.

Lilly recently hired Alex M. Azar II, former deputy secretary of
Health and Human Services, to oversee federal and state governmental
affairs teams, among his duties.

Full agenda

Lilly and other companies are on full alert this year, mostly because
of timing and the Democratic takeover of Congress.

The law that requires drug companies to pay fees to the Food and Drug
Administration to expedite the agency's review of new medicines is up
for renewal and is attracting other measures, including new drug
safety requirements.

Democrats reopened pending trade deals in part to cut some patent
protections for brand-name drug firms. Public-health groups say such
protections keep cheaper medicines out of developing countries.

Public-health groups have complained for years that the government
advisory committees created to help negotiate deals are full of
industry representatives and exclude public health groups.

President Bush recently appointed Sidney Taurel, Lilly's chief
executive, to the senior trade advisory panel.

U.S. Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., the main House sponsor of the
generic biological-drug legislation that the industry opposes, said
drug companies might not be as successful on this issue as they've
been on others.

"I think it's a different situation now," Waxman said.

Lilly acknowledges that some form of legislation allowing generic
biological drugs eventually will pass. But the company will continue
to use its lobbying muscle to make arguments it hopes will resonate
with lawmakers.

"At the end of the day, you have to understand how some of this
works: Most of the states have a life-sciences initiative going on,"
Kelley said. "They're trying to attract biotech to their states. Like
it or not, Big Pharma is a major part of the oxygen that keeps these
guys going."
