We can't really give you legal advice, but if I were you, I'd include
with the computer media containing the binary packages that you've
installed along with the corresponding source code. Alternatively, you
could just have the source code present on the machine itself if you
didn't provide media at all.
 
Using a written offer for source is also possible, but it means that
you have to keep around the source code for three years; by including
it with the computer, you can ship it and forget it. [This is one
reason why Debian has the source code for all of main on the same
servers that the binary packages are served from.]

Dropping non-free would set us back at least, what, 300 packages? It'd
take MONTHS to make up the difference, and meanwhile Debian users will
be fleeing to SLACKWARE.

And what about SHAREHOLDER VALUE?
