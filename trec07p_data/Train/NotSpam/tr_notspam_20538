10:45 AM, 6/19/07, Update: Atlantis undocks from space station=20

With pilot Lee Archambault at the controls, the shuttle Atlantis undocked f=
rom the international space station today at 10:42 a.m. as the two spacecra=
ft sailed high above New Guinea.

"Houston and ISS, from Atlantis, physical separation," radioed commander Ri=
ck Sturckow as the shuttle pulled away at a sedate tenth of a mile per hour.

"Thank you very much," called station commander Fyodor Yurchikhin, who foll=
owed naval tradition by ringing the ship's bell in the Destiny laboratory m=
odule. "Atlantis departing."

"Thank you ISS," Sturckow radioed. "Have a great remainder of your expediti=
on 15. We'll see you back on planet Earth."

Joining Archambault and Sturckow aboard Atlantis were flight engineer Steve=
 Swanson, Patrick Forrester, Danny Olivas, Jim Reilly and Sunita Williams, =
who is returning to Earth after a record six months in space, the longest s=
ingle flight by a female astronaut.

She was replaced by Clay Anderson, who hitched a ride to the station aboard=
 Atlantis to join Yurchikhin and flight engineer Oleg Kotov.

"Godspeed, C.J.," Anderson radioed Sturckow as Atlantis pulled away. "Thank=
s for everything."

Working from the aft flight deck, Archambault guided Atlantis straight away=
 from the space station to a point directly in front of the lab complex bef=
ore beginning a slow 360-degree fly-around to permit his crewmates to photo=
graph the station and its new solar arrays.

"One of the big reasons we do this is so we can get good documentation, pho=
to imagery of the space station as we leave it," Archambault said. "At a mi=
nimum, we'll be backing out to approximately 400 feet. ... We'll do a 360-(=
degree trip) round the space station to get good photo imagery from all ang=
les."

After the fly-around is complete, the shuttle astronauts will take a break =
for lunch and then use the ship's robot around to pick up the orbiter boom =
sensor system, or OBSS, for a final set of nose cap and wing leading edge i=
nspections.

"On flight day two, the scans are primarily looking for damage caused by th=
e launch environment," said shuttle Flight Director Cathy Koerner. "Here, w=
hat we're looking for are any micrometeoroid impacts that may have occurred=
 while we were on orbit. And again, we're trying to ensure the integrity of=
 the thermal protection system before entry day."
