In January 2006, the paragraphs marked XXX below were added to docs/ 
configuration.pod concerning methods to be defined in the package for  
each configuration step (e.g., config/init/manifest.pm for step  
init::manifest)

=item C<args>  # starting at trunk, line 138

Returns a list of the names of any command-line arguments the step  
cares about.
Command-line arguments are standardized in F<Configure.pl>; this will be
described L<later|/"Command-line Arguments"> in more detail.

I<XXX> Note that this method is currently unused but will be used in  
the futher
to register acceptable CLI parameters.  New steps should continue to  
define
this method.

=item L<runstep>

This method is called to actually execute the step.  The global
L<Parrot::Configure> is passed is as the first parameter.  The return  
value is
undefined.

I<XXX> In the near future the return value of this method will be  
signifigant
and there will be a means of passing additional parameters.


These remarks suggest that some additions to the functionality of the  
args and runstep method (@args is really an exported variable) would  
be forthcoming.

Does anyone know if we have plans to develop that functionality?  If  
not, then docs/configuration.pod should be revised appropriately?

Below:  the svn log listing from the point where these paragraphs  
were added:

r10960 | jhoblitt | 2006-01-07 10:41:22 -0500 (Sat, 07 Jan 2006) | 6  
lines

updated to reflect:
     - steps being split into their own namespaces
     - a Parrot::Configure object being passed to each step
     - CLI and configuration data each have their own  
Parrot::Configure::Data obj
ect
     - minor formatting, style, and spelling corrections
