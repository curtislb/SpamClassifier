I forgot to mention PowerPC. Although well known for Apple
it's almost dead in the water in that space, however it will still
hold part of the embedded space, smaller PPC processors 
are also RISC and similar to ARM although ARM is taking 
over that space rapidly and I wouldn't be surprised if PPC 
became a thing of the past. On smaller PPC system you have
all the same problems like in development on ARM if not 
more challenging. On larger systems, who will use them if 
Apple doesn't? Not many. IBM may try to push PPC into
new spaces but I don't think they will get very far.
