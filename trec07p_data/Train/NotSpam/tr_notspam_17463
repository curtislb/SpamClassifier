[0]Gary writes "What do you get when you combine a robot and a chair? The
[1]Hubo FX-1 chairbot, of course. In what is perhaps my favorite robot
design yet, this giant chair with legs looks like it came out of some
ridiculous 80's sci-fi movie or something, but it's very, very real. HUBO
FX-1 is two meters in height, and weighs 150 kg. The person sitting can
control the robot easily using the built in joystick. Each ankle has a
3-axis force/torque sensor which measures the normal force and 2 moments.
Each foot has an inclination sensor which measures the angle of the
slope. Also, the rate gyro and the inclination sensor of the body allow
the device to stabilize itself."

censorship has spread from a handful of countries to dozens of
governments that apply mandated net filtering, and because companies such

attempt to expand their markets, are colluding in these attempts,"' said

CFTM writes "The New York Times is running an interesting article about
[0]how human memory works and the theorized adaptive nature of
forgetfulness". From the article, "Whether drawing a mental blank on a
new A.T.M. password, a favorite recipe or an old boyfriend, people have
ample opportunity every day to curse their own forgetfulness. But
forgetting is also a blessing, and researchers reported on Sunday that
the ability to block certain memories reduces the demands on the brain
when it is trying to recall something important. The study, appearing in
the journal Nature Neuroscience, is the first to record visual images of
people's brains as they suppress distracting memories. The more
efficiently that study participants were tuning out irrelevant words
during a word-memorization test, the sharper the drop in activity in
areas of their brains involved in recollection. Accurate remembering
became easier, in terms of the energy required."

Southern California (USC) have developed [1]DEFACTO, a training program
which uses artificial intelligence (AI) to help firefighters practice
simulated emergency situations. The system is currently used by the Los
Angeles Fire Department. DEFACTO has committees of AI 'agents' which can
create disaster scenarios with images and maps seen in 3-D by the

disappointing. But remember — it passed unanimously. From the tech blorge
article: 'It's not just a resolution. A few corporations are actually
trying to cash in on this misguided disinformation campaign, including
BSafe Online, a Tennessee company which markets a PC filtering software.
(I wonder if it's one of the ones that can be disabled by 31% of
America's teenagers...) Their CEO has an encouraging message for parents
about safety on the internet. "This is a battle they must fight everyday
with their children in order to keep pornographers, sexual predators and
cyber-bullies at bay." And keeping those pornographers and sexual
predators away will cost you a mere $70 a year...'"

BlackBerry's addictive usefulness, and you may just get Apple's Next Big
Thing. Around 2009, when the lower cost version of iPhone appears,
Business Week believes the yearly market for iPhones [1]could be over 10
billion dollars a year. Its an interesting prediction; if those numbers
come to pass, iPhone could become a bigger source of revenue than the
traditional iPod. 'The answer may not come until 2009. By then, Apple
should have begun creating lower-cost iPhone variants to reach consumers
scared off by the introductory $499 price. It also will probably have
moved into overseas markets and cut deals with more carriers to utilize
higher-speed wireless networks. So while most analysts look for Apple to
sell around 3 million units this year and 10 to 12 million in 2008, many
figure that 20 million will move in 2009.'"

Software's Whurley and Google's Greg Stein agree that [1]the GPL v3 is

interesting theory called 'license pressure' which is similar to 'pricing
pressure'. 'Due to pressure from developers, all software is moving
towards permissive licensing" translation, the GPL and developers are
moving in opposite directions ... Developers care about the licenses on
the software they use and incorporate into their projects, they like
permissive licenses, and they will increasingly demand permissive
licenses.'"

CVG is reporting that Maxis, makers of the venerable Sim City series, has
[0]passed development of Sim City 5 to another company. The new
developer, Tilted Mill Entertainment, will be finishing the game. In a
departure from the series, it is not going to be a realistic urban
simulator. President & Director of Development Chris Beatrice responds to
criticism of that choice: "...I do not want to mislead anyone: This SC is
not a realistic urban simulation, which I understand, to many, represents
the heart of what SC is. No one is blind to that. And if you're just
completely turned off, even angered by the mere notion of any game called
'SimCity' that is not a detailed, realistic urban simulator, I absolutely
understand that viewpoint, and absolutely respect it. I do want to say,
though (with no insult intended to die hard SC fans) that we are
absolutely thrilled to be a part of this venerable series, are extremely
proud of what we have put together, and make no apologies about what we
have managed to create. And while our past experiences (including
contributions from many of you) certainly inform all our ongoing efforts,
this SC is its own unique creation."

April 2006, when an OpenSolaris mailing list revealed that Apple had

Mars: 'The geological oddity measures some 330 feet (100 meters) across
and is [2]located on an otherwise bright dusty lava plain to the
northeast of [3]Arsia Mons, one of the four giant Tharsis volcanoes on
the red planet. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) used its High
Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) instrument to draw a bead
on the apparent deep hole — a feature that may cause more scientists to
ponder about potential subsurface biology on Mars. Because the spot lacks
a raised rim or tossed out material called ejecta, researchers have ruled
out the pit being an impact crater. No walls or other details can be seen
inside the hole, and so any possible walls might be perfectly vertical
and extremely dark or — more likely — overhanging.' The [4]original image
and [5]its cutout at full resolution can be found in the [6]HiRISE site."

tall Bear can cross bumpy ground without toppling thanks to a combination
of gyroscopes and computer controlled motors to maintain balance. It is
expected to be ready for testing within five years. 'It is also narrow
enough to squeeze through doorways, but can lift 135kg (500 lbs.) with
its hydraulic arms in a single smooth movement, to avoid causing pain to
wounded soldiers. While the existing prototype slides its arms under its
burden like a forklift, future versions will be fitted with manoeuvrable
hands to gently scoop up casualties. The Bear is controlled remotely and
has cameras and microphones through which an operator sees and hears. It
can even tackle stairs while carrying a human-sized dummy.'"

[0]P. Rivacy writes "If you recall, last month we discussed Congress's
attempts to [1]outlaw the already illegal NSA wiretaps authorized by the
President. [2]The White House is now using delaying tactics to derail the
passage of that bill. Their tactic is to stall on providing documents
related to the President's warrantless wiretapping program, despite
requests from the Senate Intelligence Committee that is currently
reviewing the proposed legislation. '"Another critical priority for
congressional oversight is government wiretapping of Americans, conducted
under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and, illegally, under
the President's warrantless wiretapping program," Senator Russ Feingold
said. "When the program was finally placed within the FISA process, an
opportunity arose for the Administration and the Congress to move
forward, under the law. Unfortunately, the Administration has yet to
demonstrate a real interest in doing so."'"

[0]rs232 wrote with a PC World link discussing [1]another alliance
between Microsoft and a vendor via Linux. The vendor this time around is
electronics maker LG, and marks the fifth company to license unspecified
patents relating to Linux or Linux devices from the OS giant. "'This
agreement is focused only on exchange of patent rights,' said David
Kaefer, general manager of IP licensing at Microsoft. 'The open-source
elements of the deal do utilize a covenant model similar to the Xandros
and Novell deals, but this deal is most similar to recent agreements with
Samsung and Fuji Xerox.' Those deals were signed this year in April and
March, respectively. Both covered general access to intellectual property
contained in patent portfolios and included protection for customers
using Linux-based software."

[0]jimsnail writes "J. Craig Venter and the Institute that bears his name
are again [1]moving into new territory in the field of genetics. Genetic
patents, that is. They are seeking a broad patent that would give them
ownership of a 'free living organism that can grow and replicate'
constructed entirely from synthetic DNA. The [2]ETC Group is challenging
the claim. 'Scientists at the institute designed the bacterium to have a
"minimal genome"--the smallest set of genes any organism can live on. The
project, which began in the early 2000s, was partly a philosophical
exercise: to help define life itself better by identifying its bare-bones
requirements. But it was also fraught with commercial possibilities: if
one could reliably recreate a standardized, minimal life form, other
useful genes could be added in as needed for various purposes.'"

[0]The Bongo King writes "There have been several stories about digital
paper discussed here on the site recently, but an offering from Swedish
research scientists has a new twist. They have made a prototype
[1]billboard of interactive paper with built-in flat loudspeakers
apparently also made of paper. 'Touch sensors are made using a fine
pattern of conductive lines in which the current flow is altered when a
hand touches it. Laptop computer touchpads use the same principle.
Speakers are made by printing electromagnets out of conductive ink and
stretching the paper over a cavity like a speaker cone behind the
billboard. The electromagnets vibrate in response to a current, creating
a sound.'"

kcurtis writes "According to the Boston Globe, [0]MIT Researchers have
powered a light bulb remotely. The successful experiment lit a 60-watt
light bulb from [1]a power source two meters away, with no physical
connection between the power source and the light bulb. Details about
WiTricity, or wireless electricity, are scheduled to be reported today in
Science Express, the [2]advance online publication of the journal Science,
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said. 'The team from MIT is not
the first group to suggest wireless energy transfer. Nineteenth-century
physicist and engineer Nikola Tesla experimented with long-range wireless
energy transfer, but his most ambitious attempt - the 29m high aerial
known as Wardenclyffe Tower, in New York - failed when he ran out of
money. Others have worked on highly directional mechanisms of energy
transfer such as lasers. However, unlike the MIT work, these require an
uninterrupted line of sight, and are therefore not good for powering
objects around the home.'"

[0]Egadfly writes "The 'placeshifting' technology that allows digitally
recorded shows to be watched in several locations is growing increasingly
popular. One particular reason for this popularity is because it enables
sports fans to view locally blacked-out games over the Internet. The
National Hockey League (NHL) has announced that it will [1]actively
support placeshifting by signing an agreement with SlingBox-maker Sling
Media. The agreement will allow the company's [2]"Clip+Sling" technologyto
share both live and recorded NHL programming over the Internet.
Significantly, this has happened only days after Major League Baseball
(MLB) launched [3]a public denunciation of placeshifting, accusing
SlingBox owners of violating the law by sending television content over
the Internet and accusing Sling Media itself of violating contracts with
cable and satellite TV companies."

Scoopy writes "California resident [0]Dennis Sheehan took Gateway to
small claims court after he reportedly received a defective computer and
little technical support from the PC manufacturer. Gateway responded with
their own lawyer and a 2-inch thick stack of legal docs, and claimed that
Sheehan violated the EULA, which requires that users give up their right
to sue and settle these cases in private arbitration. Sheehan responded
that he never read the EULA, which pops up when the user first starts the
computer, because the graphics were scrambled — precisely the problem he
had complained to tech support in the first place. A judge sided with
Sheehan on May 24 and the case will proceed to small claims court. A
lawyer is quoted as saying that Sheehan, a high school dropout who is
arguing his own case, is in for a world of hurt: 'This poor guy now faces
daunting reality of having to litigate this on appeal against
Gateway...By winning, he's lost.'"
