You're right.  I do need to learn more.  I never learned null/residual
deviance.  I know the deviance is equivalent to an anova decompostion.  But
I've never dealt with it seperated like this.  

I understand deviance as the difference between two model's log-likelihood
difference between them and the most complex.  I want to compare two models
that are not the most complex.  That is why I wanted the log-likelihood.  

I am using the poisson distribution because my response is count data, so
the link is the log.  If the deviance in R is computed by comparing the
fitted model against the most saturated (which would make sense).  Then yes,
I can use that.  I just picked the log-likelihood because I'm comparing two
models.  And that's the best way.  But, it's equivalent if R compares the
fitted to the most complex.

I assumed the deviance print out tested the fitted model against the least
complex.  This tests whether the current model parameters can be dropped
(that's what I thought the null deviance meant).  I'm not sure what the
residaul deviance means though.  

My main concern is why the likelihood functions differed between SAS and R. 
If anyone has encountered this or understands why, I would appreciate some
help.
