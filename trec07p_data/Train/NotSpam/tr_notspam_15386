We needed "use English" because I was temporarily drawn to the shell
side of the Force.  I have repented.

Yes, I believe I was the one who decided that associative arrays needed
a shorter name, and after a period of discussion on perl5-porters,
settled on "hash" as the new technical term in Perl culture.  But I'm
not sure the mailing list archive goes back far enough to verify the
exact sequence of events.  Certainly I made the final decision, but
it's quite possible someone else suggested it first.  But I seem to
recall getting extremely tired of typing "associative array" while
working on Camel II, and that was likely the instigation.
