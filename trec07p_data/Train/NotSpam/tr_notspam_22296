The only downside of this is forgetting, missing parts.
Your local tree works, but the patch you send does not as some of the
premises are missing. But I guess this happen seldom enough it is not a
good reason to hold up using a possibly better model.

Uhmm how this is true? I mean, in some case the code need to be
different between 2 trees, who will adjust the patches to apply
cleanly ?

Ahh so more people can commit on the same tree?
I didn't understand this, if that works then I guess we could end up
with the best mix between centralized and distributed development,
sounds interesting.

Ok, but to really test the D in DSCM we need to be more than one and
test how the exchange of patches between individual trees works.
I will try it as well.

Simo.
