This sample from your log looks like your computer reestablishing a
new IP address with a router after a disconnect of some sort or after
the previously assigned IP address expired.  Given the number of
seconds assigned, the IP addresses appear to expire every 12 hours,
and then a new one needs to be assigned.  If this type of stuff shows
up in your log more frequently than about once every twelve hours,
then something is causing the connection to be dropped--what that
something might be is not clear from this sample of log info.

HTH, and have a great day.
