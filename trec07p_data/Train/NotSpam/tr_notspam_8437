I was just involved in the liquidation of the partial contents of an
Historic event taking place in Springfield, Massachusetts at the Masonic
Temple on State street in Springfield. This was an amazing sale however
during the middle of the event a customer (and his party)?strayed away from
the crowd and got into a back meeting room and stole several important
objects belonging to the Order of the Eastern Star. This is a women's group
connected to the Masonic order. This sale and theft date was on April 21,
2007. This is a benevolent society that only does good and I found this vile
act extremely offensive. (XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX) I am certain who did this and
observed a certain group participating in this event which was put together
by Stanton Auctions?of Hamden, Massachusetts. This group's actions were so
suspect it caused me to take down some plate numbers all belonging to
vehicles?with California tags. (XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX)??

I was in hopes you would post this with the below listing of the stolen
items.

1. Engraved Gavel with brass plate bearing the notation "Gail A. Gutermann".

2. Ceremonial dagger/short sword with cross handle, pommel and white enamel
work of the Masonic order.

3. 18 various jeweled ceremonial necklaces on 5 colored braided cords. 13
are hexagon shaped with 5 point stars medallions and 5 are triangle formed.
All are clearly marked as belonging to the order of The Eastern Star and all
have various symbolic designs engraved on the medallions.

The British and the Benin Bronzes

The Kingdom of Benin had a long history of peaceful relations with European
nations. Many early Portuguese, Dutch and British Visitors had expressed
admiration for this great African Civilization. However, just under 100
years ago in 1897, the British, fueled by a desire to control trade in the
area, launched a "Punitive Expedition" to attack Benin City. They deposed of
the Oba (King) of Benin, burnt down his palace and looted the collection of
unique art works in Bronze and ivory that adorned the palace.


The premier collection of the priceless Benin art treasures is today held at
the Museum of Mankind in London.

The Events of 1897

Justification for the violent overthrow of this independent kingdom was to
avenge the deaths of seven Britons who had been ambushed who had been
ambushed on a path to Benin a few weeks earlier. They were represented as
peaceful ambassadors sent to discuss the operation of a trade treaty with
the Oba, who were then murdered in cold blood - however, the evidence tells
a different story.

Before they set out, James Philips, the colonial officer who headed the
mission, sent a report to his superiors in Whitehall complaining about the
unprofitability of trade in the area. He recommended;

    "...I am certain that there is only one remedy, that is to depose of the
king of Benin...I am concerned that pacific measures are now quite useless,
and that the time has now come to remove the obstruction ... I would add
that I have reason to hope that sufficient ivory may be found in the King's
house to pay the expenses incurred."

Philips sent a message to the Oba informing him of his intention to visit
Benin and received a reply asking him to delay. his visit for a while due to
the customary rites that were being performed at the time, during which
foreigners were not permitted to enter the city. Philips ignored several
such messages.

It is not surprising that the generals whose task it was to defend Benin saw
this expedition, that had refused to heed repeated request to turn back and
wait for an official invitation, as a threat. In the recent past the British
had used force several times to depose other African leaders whom they had
found too powerful to dominate. They responded to this threat by ambushing
the party, leaving seven of the nine Britons dead. The British government
and press responded with self righteous outrage.

The Benis saw the 1987 event as an evil intrusion to their sovereignty end
the annexation of their region by a foreign power as unjustified. The then
King, Oba Ovonramwen, was subsequently deposed and sent into exile. Benin
City, whose civilization dates further back than the 13th

Century, was almost completely destroyed. Sacred treasures discovered by the
colonial army were stripped from their rightful owners and looted mainly to
Britain, and later to other countries in the West.
The Benin Bronzes Today

When the looted art treasures were brought back to England many of the
military officers kept private collections of them, whilst the foreign
office sold considerable quantities, much of which found it's way to museums
of Europe and America. The remarkable quality of the work was rapidly
reflected in high auction room prices. The Foreign Office gave the British
museum a huge quantity of Bronze wall plaques which depict the history of
the Benin Empire in the 1 5th and 1 6th century. Many are displayed in the
ethnographic section of the museum. The premier collection of these
priceless Benin art treasures are today held at the Museum of Mankind (
there are also many, many more, held in private collections which we do not
know about. )

These Museums also retained selling rights of duplicates to the originals,
which of course means that enormous profits have been made. In 1984,
Sothebys auctioned a Benin plaque featuring a musician in the catalogue
accompanying the auction, the asking price was set at between ?25,000 -
?35,000. Many famous European artists, such as Picasso, have emulated the
fine and abstract dimensional images found in Benin art - however, not a
penny from this profit has ever gone back to Benin, from where the art was
stolen. African scholars must by necessity travel to London to see these
works displayed without adequate commentary or proper context. The British
Museum and London continues to gain income from visitors from Africa and
elsewhere - this should of course be transferred to Africa. Africa is the
appropriate place to study and understand African Art and Artefacts and it
would also generate much needed income from tourism and scholarship if these
items were returned.

The Nigerian government has made several unsuccessful requests for the
restitution of these artefacts, since 1960 when they gained independence. On
several occasions, they paid exorbitant prices amounting to thousands of
pounds to retain possession of some of these artefacts. Great offence was
caused when the British Museum and the British Government refused even the
loan of a single ivory mask for a vast pan-African Arts festival in 1977.

The looting of artworks in the course of military conflict has been outlawed
since the Napoleonic wars and the restitution of looted works within Europe
enforced. Increasingly, the morality and legality of holding art collections
seized by force is being questioned. In the true sense of justice and
self-determination, the Benin artefacts belong to the culture from where
they were deprived from - they symbolise a historical and social
significance which the aesthetic and monetary value they hold in exile would
never compensate.

PARTHENON MARBLES

PM says getting antiquities back is still a priority for Greece

The return of the Parthenon Marbles to Greece from the British Museum is
still a "main target" for the government, Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis
said on Saturday after viewing a set of recently returned 5th century cups
that have been put on display at the Ancient Agora in central Athens. "I am
sure that the construction of the New Acropolis Museum, which is now being
built at a rapid pace, will provide a new, powerful argument to this effort
[to bring back the Marbles]," Karamanlis said. Visitors are likely to be
allowed into the museum some time next year.

"Saliera"-Prozess wird Ende Juni wiederholt
Der Prozess um den Diebstahl der "Saliera" wird am 26. Juni wiederholt. Das
gab heute das Wiener Straflandesgericht bekannt. Beim Ersturteil war ein
"Schnitzer" unterlaufen.  
     
     
Der Diebstahl der "Saliera" sorgte wochenlang f?r Aufruhr.    Vier Jahre
Freiheitsstrafe laut Ersturteil
Der Oberste Gerichtshof (OGH) hatte das Ersturteil vom September 2006 aus
formalen Gr?nden aufgehoben und eine Neudurchf?hrung des Verfahrens
angeordnet. 

Robert Mang, der mit dem Diebstahl aus dem Kunsthistorischen Museum (KHM)
f?r Schlagzeilen gesorgt hatte, war bei einem Strafrahmen von bis zu zehn
Jahren zu einer vierj?hrigen Freiheitsstrafe verurteilt worden.  
     
     
    Briefe waren Erpressungsversuch

Nach Ansicht des OGH unterlief dem Gericht dabei jedoch ein "Schnitzer": Die
Briefe, in denen Mang L?segeld forderte und f?r den Fall des Nichtbezahlens
das Einschmelzen der Saliera androhte, w?ren als Erpressungsversuch zu
werten gewesen. Das Erstgericht hatte Mang wegen schweren
Einbruchsdiebstahls und versuchter N?tigung schuldig gesprochen.  
     
    Diebstahl nach Disco-Besuch

Laut Eigenen Angaben war Mang, ein Alarmanlagen-Experte, am 11. Mai 2003
nach einem Disco-Besuch auf die Idee gekommen, seinen schon l?nger gefassten
Plan in die Tat umzusetzen. ?ber ein Bauger?st drang der inzwischen
50-J?hrige ins Museumsinnere vor. Er wusste, dass die R?umlichkeiten
schlecht gesichert waren. 

Nach dem gelungenen Coup verwahrte Mang das Salzfass (Wert: mindestens 36
Millionen Euro) einige Zeit unter seinem Bett, ehe er es in einem Waldst?ck
bei Zwettl vergrub und brieflich mehrfach L?segeld verlangte.  
     
     
    Tat mit "Lebenskrise" erkl?rt

Nachdem die Polizei immer n?her an den gesuchten "Saliera"-Dieb heranger?ckt
war, konnte Mang am 20. J?nner 2006 festgenommen werden. Er f?hrte die
Ermittler zum Versteck der gestohlenen Kostbarkeit und legte ein umfassendes
Gest?ndnis ab. 

Die Tat erkl?rte er selbst mit einer "Lebenskrise": Neben einer
Krebserkrankung habe er vor allem den Umstand nicht verkraftet, dass sich
seine Frau scheiden lie?, um eine neue Lebensgemeinschaft einzugehen.

L'?troite coop?ration entre la police libanaise, Interpol et les experts
italiens en oeuvres d'art a permis de retrouver une sculpture ancienne
repr?sentant un roi arabe, vol?e au mus?e national de Bagdad.

La police a r?cemment saisi au domicile d'un d?corateur libanais tr?s connu
une t?te en pierre calcaire du roi Sanatruq I er de Hatra. Apr?s sa
d?couverte sur un site arch?ologique ? Hatra, la sculpture avait ?t? expos?e

du vol n'ont pas ?t? confirm?es.

La sculpture, d'une hauteur de 47 cm, date du II e si?cle avant J.-C. Elle
est apparue dans un reportage sur le d?corateur diffus? en juin 2006 par la
cha?ne de t?l?vision Al-Jazira. Un ?minent sp?cialiste italien de
l'universit? de Turin ayant particip? ? l'exp?dition arch?ologique d'Hatra a
cru reconna?tre la sculpture montr?e dans le reportage et en a inform?
Interpol. 

Interpol s'est procur? une copie du reportage, de laquelle il a extrait une

Bronze Busts Stolen From Cleveland Gardens
By Staff
May 7, 2007
 
Two historical bronze busts were stolen from two of Cleveland's Cultural
Gardens while a third artifact was damaged during the theft.

One of the busts was taken from the city's Hungarian Cultural Garden,
another sculpture was removed and a third damaged at the Slovak Cultural
Garden last week, The Cleveland Plain Dealer reported Monday.

Cultural Gardens delegate David Dusek said the thieves took a pair of
valuable busts Friday night and damaged a third while removing it from its
pedestal.

"They went for the good ones ... the bronze," Dusek said. "These are
original pieces."

Police were contacting area scrap dealers in case the thieves try to sell
the sculptures for their metal.

The chairman of the Cleveland Cultural Gardens Federation said the theft
will not affect the group's expansion plans. (c) UPI

*Antiquities Returned to Greece by Getty Museum*
 
Athens.- Prime minister Costas Karamanlis on Thursday praised the 
culture ministry's systematic work for the return of the Parthenon 
Marbles to Greece, as well as the return of all antiquities illegally 
excavated and smuggled out of the country, in the effort to safeguard 
Greece's cultural heritage.

"Defending our cultural heritage using all legal means is a self-evident 
obligation. Claiming from foreign museums and collectors every Greek 
ancient artifact for which we have evidence that it was the product of 
antiquities-smuggling, illegal excavation or illegal trade is a matter 
of urgent priority," the Greek premier stressed.

Karamanlis was speaking to reporters after a handover ceremony marking 
the return of two important ancient Greek artifacts from the J. Paul 
Getty Museum in Los Angeles, held at the National Archaeological Museum 
in Athens, where the artifacts will be on display.

The artifacts are a 4th century B.C. gold funerary wreath from the 
northern Greek province of Macedonia and an archaic-era statue of a 
'kore' (young woman) made of Parian marble. They are the last of four 
artifacts returned to Greece by the museum under an agreement announced 
a few months ago.

The agreement with the Getty Museum, where the antiquities were housed, 
was reached after the Greek government contested the legality of their 
export from the country.

Karamanlis further said that a bill aimed at curbing the illegal trade 
and smuggling of antiquties would be tabled in parliament by the culture 
ministry in the near future.

"Policy is vindicated when it yields tangible results. Our goals become 
action, day by day," Karamanlis added.

The Greek premier also referred to the completion of the new Acropolis 
Museum and the return of two fragments of the Parthenon and the 
Erechtheum in 2006, noting that these "dismissed the spurious excuses 
put forward for not returning the Parthenon sculptures".

Speaking after the premier, Culture Minister George Voulgarakis 
described the two ancient artifacts retrieved from the J. Paul Getty 
Museum as "masterpieces of Greek art".

The minister also emphasised the fact that all four items returned by 
the Getty were given back without any form of exchange and without 
intervention by a court.

"The era when stolen objects of great value could be bought on the 
'grey' market is gone, never to return," Voulgarakis underlined.

He noted that the deal would allow Greece to claim the things that 
rightfully belonged to it, provided there was proof that it had been 
illegally obtained and exported from the country.

According to the minister, meanwhile, the international community's 
"shift to respecting international law and ethics" was not incompatible 
with the "healthy interests of great museums".

Apart from the golden wreath and the kore, the Los Angeles-based Getty 
museum had in August 2006 returned a 4th-century B.C. black limestone 
stele - grave marker - and a 6th-century B.C. marble votive relief from 
Thasos that also went on display at the National Archaeological Museum 
in Athens.

The stele was unearthed during an illegal dig in the 1990s near the city 
of Thebes while the votive relief was stolen almost a century ago from 
the French Archaeological School warehouse on the Aegean island of Thasos.

Art museum limits its antiquities acquisitions
Artifacts removed from their country of origin after 1970 must be 
exported legally, IMA director says

By Whitney Smith

The Indianapolis Museum of Art will not buy or accept gifts of ancient 
artifacts that left the country where they were discovered after 1970 -- 
unless there's proof they were exported legally. The decision by IMA 
Director and CEO Maxwell L. Anderson and the museum's board comes amid 
an at-times acrimonious international debate about black-market 
trafficking in antiquities that may encourage the plundering of 
archaeological sites.
The IMA isn't the only museum struggling with this issue. The J. Paul 
Getty Museum in Los Angeles adopted a policy similar to the IMA's last fall.
Some government authorities, especially in antiquity-rich Italy, have 
demanded that artifacts in museums be returned.
Last year, New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art agreed to return 
objects allegedly stolen from ancient sites in Italy, in exchange for 
long-term loans of other objects. Its director, Philippe de Montebello, 
however, has made a case that museums should keep acquiring antiquities 
-- generally defined as objects that pre-date the Middle Ages in Europe 
-- even without complete documentation.
Founded in 1883, the IMA is the nation's fifth-largest encyclopedic art 
museum, with more than 50,000 objects, said museum spokeswoman Jessica 
DiSanto. The museum's Asian art collection, including many antiquities, 
is a signature feature.
Anderson, 51, has been with the IMA for almost a year but has been 
passionate about acquisitions for decades. As a former president of the 
Association of Art Museum Directors, he is a well-known figure in the 
debate.
"I've had the unhappy experience of seeing pillaged sites in Italy, when 
I was a curator for the Met in the '80s," Anderson said in a phone 
interview from Washington. "Tomb robbers are seeing what they want, 
popping open the tombs like soft-boiled eggs, grabbing things and 
disappearing."
In 2005, The New York Times quoted him as saying museum directors could 
no longer stand behind old collecting practices. "The ground is shifting 
radically under the pressure of newly documented claims," he said. 
"While there may not be a single clear solution for every claim, 
institutions will need to be forthright in explaining future acquisitions."
Anderson thinks the IMA policy -- which still lets it acquire 
antiquities if they arrived in the U.S. before a 1970 United Nations 
protocol -- could become part of a growing trend.
"It is our hope that the IMA's moratorium will encourage other major 
collecting institutions around the world to take a similar step, along 
with collectors and dealers," Anderson wrote in this month's edition of 
The Art Newspaper, published in London. "A universal moratorium would 
seriously impact the clandestine trade in antiquities."
One IMA patron agreed that museums must be concerned about an object's 
pedigree.
"Objects ought to be documented, regardless of the year," said 
Northwestside resident Robert Grubbs, 74, as he stood at a balcony near 
the IMA's Asian art collection. "I think, at least, that objects that 
are documented could be marked."

Roban corona de oro de la Virgen en templo de Quillota
Lunes 7 de Mayo de 2007
Fuente :El Mercurio de Valpara?so

Desconocidos robaron la corona de oro de la imagen de la Virgen del 
Carmen, ubicada al interior del templo y convento San Francisco de 
Quillota, en pleno centro de la ciudad.

El hecho se produjo a menos de una semana desde que se concretara la 
salida de los Franciscanos de la ciudad, lo que no significa que el 
templo quede abandonado, ya que se continuar?n oficiando misas hasta el 
arribo de una nueva congregaci?n.

Sin embargo, esto no fue obst?culo, para que desconocidos ingresaran al 
templo en horas de la madrugada, para lo cual rompieron los candados de 
acceso al recinto. Ya en su interior se dirigieron a la gruta ubicada en 
el exterior de la parroquia, donde existen varias im?genes religiosas.

All? robaron las alcanc?as donde los fieles hacen sus aportes en dinero 
y posteriormente abrieron la vitrina donde estaba la imagen de la Virgen 
del Carmen, sustrayendo la corona de oro que ten?a en su cabeza.

Seg?n se indic?, la joya tendr?a un valor de m?s de 500 mil pesos y 
hab?a sido donada por la familia Asmad, una de las m?s tradicionales de 
Quillota, en homenaje a la Virgen, por lo que m?s all? del valor 
comercial, exist?a un valor sentimental en el objeto robado.

Los antecedentes de este robo quedaron en manos de la Fiscal?a de 
Quillota, la que habr?a iniciado las diligencias para dar con el 
paradero de los autores de este delito, sin descartarse la posibilidad 
de recurrir a la im?genes de la c?mara de televigilancia que existe a 
metros del templo.

Otro caso

Este no es el primer caso de robo que afecta a templos en la comuna de 
Quillota. En febrero de 2005 fue sustra?da la imagen del Ni?o Jes?s que 
cargaba la Virgen del Carmen en la iglesia San Mart?n de Tours.

Se trata de una escultura tallada en madera y de origen quite?o, de unos 
300 a?os de antig?edad. Era la imagen de mayor valor que pose?a la 
c?ntrica parroquia de Quillota.

El robo de esta imagen caus? gran pesar entre la feligres?a que asiste a 
la iglesia, pues representaba un valor patrimonial y un sello que 
caracterizaba al lugar. La imagen no cuenta con tasaci?n en dinero, pues 
dicha informaci?n no estaba en conocimiento del sacerdote. La misteriosa 
desaparici?n del Ni?o Jes?s ha generado la especulaci?n de que esta 
sustracci?n pueda ser un robo por encargo, dada la particularidad del 
delito y la selecci?n que hizo el ladr?n de la pieza sustra?da. Lo 
anterior, considerando que dentro de la iglesia hay m?s de cinco 
esculturas adem?s de la robada y que el antisocial se inclin? por la de 
m?s dif?cil acceso, ya que se encontraba al lado del altar principal, en 
altura y atornillada a la imagen de la Sant?sima Virgen.

Apenas los encargados del templo se percataron del robo, estamparon la 
denuncia en Carabineros y en la Polic?a de Investigaciones de Quillota. 
Sin embargo hasta la fecha no se ha podido dar con el paradero del autor 
del il?cito, ni tampoco se ha podido recuperar la pieza robada.
