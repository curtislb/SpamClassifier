X2R is a bundle of three software libraries allowing the user to pass 
structured data easily from Fortran, C/C++, or AD Model Builder to R.

An update to X2R has been sent to CRAN today and should be available at 
mirrors shortly. This fixes a bug in the ADMB2R and C2R components in 
which data frames were not written correctly when the user did not 
specify row names. Several other minor improvements also have been made.

The new version is supplied as files X2R.zip and X2R.tar.gz, which are 
equivalent.  The version and release date can be identified from the 
contents of file "VersionInfo.txt" in the root of each archive. The new 
version bears date April 16, 2007.

                                * * *

 From the original announcement:

X2R is composed of three related software libraries: C2R,  ADMB2R, and
For2R (together, X2R). Each contains output routines to simplify
transfer of complicated data structures from models written in a
compiled language to R.  The user's data can be written as a structured
ASCII file which, when read by R (note 1) with a single dget() function
call, will become an R data object of type list. The list, may contain
components such as data frames, matrices, and other lists.

These are NOT R packages; rather they are subroutine libraries to be
used with programmers' own modeling codes.  Limited testing indicates
that they are compatible with S-PLUS, as well (note 1, note 2).

Languages supported are Fortran 95 (with For2R), C and C++ (with C2R)
and AD Model Builder (with ADMB2R) (note 1, note 3).  Source code and
users' manuals are supplied.

This work has been tested and used by the authors. However, any software
may contain bugs, and these works are classified by NOAA as
"Experimental Products."  Although the software is supplied with no
warranty whatsoever, bug reports, suggestions, and extensions are
solicited (send to Prager or Martin).  The authors will attempt to fix
all bugs promptly and to add requested features.

Software is now available at CRAN,  http://cran.r-project.org/ .  Look
under "Software / Other" for the current X2R distribution.
