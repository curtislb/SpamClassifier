[0]eldavojohn writes "Google is currently fighting many fronts in its
ability to show small images returned in a search from websites. Most
recently, [1]Google won the case against them in which they were
displaying nude thumbnails of a photographer's work from his site. Prior
to this, Google was barred from displaying copyrighted content, even when
linking it to the site (owner) from its search results. The verdict:
"Saying the District Court erred, the San Francisco-based appeals court
ruled that Google could legally display those images under the fair use
doctrine of copyright law." This sets a rather hefty precedence in a
search engine's ability to blindly serve content safely under fair use."

Inc.'s iPhone, clearing the way for the combined phone and music player
to hit the shelves. Apple expects to begin selling the phones in late
June. Some of the FCC documents confirm a few features of the phone,
including it will have Bluetooth and Wi-Fi and will operate in the

[4]the shifting of the advertising market away from traditional media."
Update: 05/18 21:51 GMT by [5]Z : Michelle Nicolosi, Assistant Managing
Editor for the PI, emailed this correction: "Someday, Seattle P-I readers
may be able to carry around their news in a bendable, electronic paper
device -- [6]but not any time soon. Hearst Corp., which owns the Seattle
P-I, has no plans to use the Seattle daily newspaper to test a newly
announced E-paper gadget." The original site linked apparently got it

formerly governed Iraq, accidentally published Microsoft Word documents
[1]containing information never meant for the public, according to an
article in Salon. By [2]viewing the documents using the Track Changes
feature in Word (.doc), the author has been able to reconstruct internal
discussions from 2004 which reflect the optimism, isolation and
incompetence of the American occupation. Download the author's source
document or [3]look for more yourself. 'Presumably, staffers at the CPA's
Information Management Unit, which produced the weekly reports, were
cutting and pasting large sections of text into the reports and then
eliminating all but the few short passages they needed. Much of the
material they were cribbing seems to have come from the kind of
sensitive, security-related documents that were never meant to be
available to the public. In fact, about half of the 20 improperly
redacted documents I downloaded, including the March 28 report, contain
deleted portions that all seem to come from one single, 1,000-word
security memo. The editors kept pulling text from a document titled "Why
Are the Attacks Down in Al-Anbar Province -- Several Theories." (The
security memo and the last page of the March 28 report can be seen here,
along with several other CPA documents that can be downloaded.)'"

Overly Critical Guy writes "Microsoft's figure of 40 million Vista OEM
licenses sold has less impact when [0]weighed against the expanded size
of the PC market, according to IDC numbers. The myriad of factors
involved in determining success in the market makes Microsoft's constant
comparisons to Windows XP less reliable as a growth indicator —
particularly with Microsoft refusing to reveal the number of actual
activated Vista licenses. 'HP reported year-over-year PC sales growth of
about 24 percent, or about twice worldwide PC sales growth. Whatever HP
is doing right, it's more than just Vista ... If Microsoft wasn't so hung
up on XP comparisons as the benchmark, it could really demonstrate that
Vista sales are increasing. The first 20 million figure really
represented four months of sales, and that could have been positive data
because Microsoft protected its customers' holiday investments. For free!
Instead of making that point, Microsoft got carried away with making
comparisons back to XP.'"

quanticle writes "According to House Democrats, [0]broadband isn't
broadband unless its at least 2Mbps. The view of the House Subcommittee
on Telecommunications is that the FCC's data collection standards are
hopelessly outdated, and is proposing a number of updates to their
criteria. For one, they want 'broadband' reclassified to at least 2mbs,
up from 200kbps. Another requirement will change the FCC's outlook on
broadband availability. Just because one household in a zip code has
broadband access, that will not longer mean everyone in the zip code
does. 'The plan went over well with the consumer advocates who appeared
before the subcommittee. Larry Cohen, president of the Communication
Workers of America, said that the US is "stuck with a twentieth century
Internet" and that he would support increasing the "broadband" definition
to 2Mbps. Ben Scott of Free Press echoed that sentiment, suggesting that
the definition needs to be an evolving standard that increases over time,
which is in contrast to the current FCC definition; it has not changed in
nine years. "We have always been limited by the FCC's inadequate and
flawed data," he said.'"

[0]bain writes "The BBC is reporting that [1]Microsoft has agreed to buy
the digital marketing firm Aquantive, in what will be its biggest ever
acquisition. The software giant spent almost $6 billion acquiring the
agency, in its first bid to tackle the online advertising market. 'The
deal is expected to be completed in the first half of 2008, subject to
regulation. Microsoft said the expensive price tag was worth it to access
the complementary technology of Aquantive. The firm will continue to
operate from Seattle as part of Microsoft's online operations, and will
help the software giant broaden the scope of services its MSN consumer
internet unit can offer. Microsoft is the latest technology firm to
pounce on the shrinking independent online advertising sector.'"

[0]eldavojohn writes "A new research paper is creating some buzz about
[1]the roles of computer engineering in biology. Historically,
computational techniques in genome sequencing have proved useful in
predicting which DNA sequence produces which amino acid and which amino
acid sequence produces which protein. Now, this new [2]research is
leading towards a robust model of proteins and their messaging systems.
This is one step further in understanding the basics of life and,
consequently, pushes us closer to being able to emulate organisms
entirely from the bottom up instead of our failed prior approaches of
from the top down. A long way from perfect, but an opening into a wide
field of study and maybe even a new division of biology."

[0]BlueMorpho writes with a link to a Space.com article about a recently
discovered extrasolar planet [1]that may be able to harbor 'life as we
know it.' Orbiting around the star Gliese 581 is a small rocky ball that
might have the same liquid ocean and drifting continent configuration
we're familiar with. The find may be unique in all of space exploration
as this planet appears to be within a habitable band of temperatures for
life, and is categorically not a gas giant. "The bottom line is exciting
...The conditions for life could be there, but is life itself? As yet,
there's no way to know unless the planet has spawned beings that are at
least as clever as we are. As part of the SETI Institute's Project
Phoenix, we twice aimed large antennas in the direction of Gliese 581,
hoping to pick up a signal that would bespeak technology ... Neither
search turned up a signal."

Famestay writes "Verisign's iDefense is [0]putting up a $16,000 prize for
any hacker who can find a remotely exploitable vulnerability in six
critical Internet infrastructure applications. The bounty is for a
zero-day code execution hole on the following Internet infrastructure
technologies: Apache httpd, Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) daemon,
Sendmail SMTP daemon, OpenSSH sshd, Microsoft Internet Information (IIS)
Server and Microsoft Exchange Server. 'Immunity founder Dave Aitel, who
also purchases flaws and exploits for use in the CANVAS pen testing tool,
says its doubtful iDefense will get any submissions from hackers. "It's
very hard to exploit [those listed applications]," Aitel said. "IIS 6
hasn't had a public remotely exploitable bug in it. Ever." Several other
hackers I spoke to had very much the same message, arguing that $16,000
can never equate to the amount of work/expertise required to find and
exploit a hole in the six targeted technologies.'"

[0]Pcol writes "For the past 13 years the University of Maryland School
of Medicine has presented a [1]historical clinicopathological conference
where they consider famous historical medical cases such as the death of
Alexander the Great and composer Ludwig van Beethoven and provide a
modern diagnosis and treatment in each case. This year Dr. Thomas M.
Scalea, physician-in-chief for the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center
discusses if the world's first center for trauma victims could have
improved the outcome had [2]Lincoln's assassination occurred in 2007.
'This could be a recoverable injury, with a reasonable expectation he
would survive,' Scalea said, noting that assassin's weapon was relatively
impotent compared to the firepower now on the streets today. The modern
prognosis predicts that Lincoln might have conceivably recovered enough
to return to the White House to complete his second term."

An anonymous reader writes "Techdirt has a story about a new [0]class
action lawsuit against Netflix, claiming that the patents the company is
using to [1]sue Blockbuster were obtained fraudulently. Specifically, the
lawsuit claims that Netflix was well aware of prior art, but did not
include it in its patent filing, as required by law. The lawsuit also
claims that Netflix then used these fraudulently obtained patents to
scare others out of the market, in violation of antitrust law.
'Certainly, it makes for an interesting argument. Patents grant a
government-backed monopoly -- which should get you around any antitrust
violations. However, if that patent is obtained fraudulently, then I can
see a pretty compelling claim that you've abused antitrust law. It would
be interesting if other such cases start popping up (and, indeed, the
lawyer who sent it to us said his firm is looking for additional patents
to go after in this manner).'"

[0]Lamont Wood's demo it did very well at too/two/to and which/witch, but
will it still render 'I really admire your analysis' as "I really admire
urinalysis'? At 95% accuracy, people aren't jumping on the bandwagon.
Wood's typing speed is about 60 wpm with 93% accuracy, so he found that
[1]using speech recognition was about twice as fast as typing. Those who
type at hunt-and-peck speeds will experience results that are even more
dramatic. There's really only one product on the US market: Dragon
NaturallySpeaking from Nuance Communications. The free versions from
Microsoft aren't up to the task and IBM sold ViaVoice to Nuance, where
it's treated as an entry-level product."

mrnomas writes with a link to the Audioholics site, which wonders [0]why
the HDMI standard is such a mess? The article's author suggests that the
format was designed for the benefit of the content-producers and not the
consumer. The result is a signal that's hard to route and switch, as well
and unnecessarily complicated cable assemblies. They reach back to the
DVI standard to see what might be done to make HDMI a little more
consumer-friendly, with numerous technical elements woven through the
discussion. "DVI lacked a couple of things which the consumer audio/video
industry wanted. It was implemented on a variety of HD displays and
source devices, but it was confusing for the consumer because of the many
variants on the standard and different connector configurations, and it
didn't carry audio signals. A consortium to develop and promote a new
interface, HDMI, was formed; the idea was to come up with a standard
which could be implemented more uniformly, was less confusing, and
offered the option of routing audio signals along with video."
