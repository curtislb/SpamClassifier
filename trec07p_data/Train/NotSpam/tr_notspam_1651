I'm not sure that is possible. When we're talking about the logo,
it is protected both by copyright and by trademark. I can't copy
and distribute the logo unless I am licensed under both.

You could of course separately license the two. But then you run
in exactly the problem I tried to solve with the conditional 
copyright grant.

I did that to ensure that people couldn't take the logo, change a
few pixels and then use the derivative logo in a confusing way.
If the copyright license doesn't tie in to the trademark license,
but instead says "do whatever you want with your derivative", people
could argue the copyright license trumps the trademark restriction.

If the derivative image isn't confusingly similar to the trademark logo,
then the no-confusion condition does not apply. I don't think this is
an issue.

The only string attached to the derivative image is that it can't be
used in commerce in a way that creates confusion with the original
Debian logo. That is importing a trademark rule into a copyright
license, true. But this is also _the default_ under trademark law.

You are not allowed to use any sign in commerce that creates confusion(*)
with someone's trademark logo. It doesn't matter if your sign is a
derivative work of the logo under copyright law. I could be completely
ignorant of your mark, fiddle a bit with the Gimp and produce a swirl that
accidentally looks like the Debian logo. Copyright says I'm fine, but I
still can't put that swirl on CD-ROMs with an operating system and sell
those.

So I can't imagine a situation where the trademark restriction
affecting the copyright license would be a problem. 

> In summary, I think that enforcing trademark-like restrictions through

This isn't a _trademark-like_ restriction, it is an actual
trademark restriction. There's a difference. In some copyright
licenses people try to create a pseudo-trademark by saying
"you can't use our name for anything except to refer to our
product". That goes beyond what trademark law allows you to do.

In essence, the trademark license I suggested (but TWNLA) says
"you are forbidden from doing what trademark law forbids you".
So this stays exactly within the bounds of trademark law.

An alternative would be to drop the exception on the copyright
license, and modify the trademark license to say

"The Mark Holder hereby licenses you to use the Marks *or
a modified version thereof* in any way...
You are not authorized to use the Marks *or a modified version
thereof* ..."

That makes it clear you are not licensed under the trademark
to use derivatives in a confusing way. It's not as clear
as what I previously suggested, because now you have to figure
out which wins: the copyright license that says you can do
anything, or the trademark license that says you cannot do
this one thing?
