I do not personally see any distribution problems with this licence.


The only possible (general) issue is the exact definition of the game "Frets
on fire".
Does that alow minor derivitives that use the same name? (That is what
Debian would be distributing,
most likely, as Debian packages often include patches against the source
code).

It would be nice if this would be expanded to include all derivitves of FoF.
However, even just expansion to include all derivitives of FoF that retain
the same game style
(that is to say are still Guitar Hero clones), would be an improvment.
