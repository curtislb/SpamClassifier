Florida, space shuttle managers have announced an [1]official launch date
for STS-117 to be June 8, 7:38 PM. The launch window will run in two
parts — from June 8th to the evening of June 12th when the shuttle must
stand down for a June 14th Atlas launch. After that the windows opens
again on the 17th. This first opening gives the standard four attempts in
five days. If they have not launched by the 12th, they will replenish
things such as liquid oxygen and hydrogen for the fuel cells to prepare
for the 17th attempt."

example, TimeStomp. Forensic investigators poring over compromised

the Linux operating system in baby steps this June when it [0]starts
selling its Wizpy media player worldwide. The pocket-sized device, which
plays audio and video files, is really a Linux carrot of sorts, in that
it also allows users to store a complete Linux desktop in its memory. You
can plug the Wizpy into a PC's USB port and boot up the Linux system with
all its user settings, passwords, bookmarks, etc. It originally launched
in Japan, where TurboLinux marketed it to 'early adopters who are curious
about using Linux but either don't want to or can't install the operating
system.' The company will now target the same crowd around the globe,
starting in the U.S., the U.K., Australia, India and Singapore."

An anonymous reader writes "The most notable changes found in this latest
draft include [0]making GPLv3 compatible with version 2.0 of the Apache
license, ensuring that distributors who make discriminatory patent deals
after March 28 may not convey software under GPLv3, adding terms to
clarify how users can contract for private modification of free software
or for a data center to run it for them, and replacing the previous
reference to a U.S. consumer protection statute with explicit criteria
for greater clarity outside the United States. The draft also does not
prohibit Novell from distributing software under GPLv3 'because the
patent protection they arranged with Microsoft last November can be
turned against Microsoft to the community's benefit,' FSF executive
director Peter Brown said."

ultimately is about where you draw the line between taking public photos

'The next step might be seeing books on my shelf. If the government was
doing this, people would be outraged.' Wired has started a contest on the
[3]most interesting photos found using the new Google Tool that now
includes sunbathing coeds, alleged drug deals, and the google van itself.
'I think that this product illustrates a tension between our First
Amendment right to document public spaces around us, and the privacy
interests people have as they go about their day,' says Kevin Bankston, a
staff lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation."

[0]VincenzoRomano writes "ArsTechnica has just published an [1]update to
the neverending story about copy protection used in HD DVD and Blu-ray
discs and hacker efforts against it. From the article: 'The ongoing war
between content producers and hackers over the AACS copy protection used
in HD DVD and Blu-ray discs produced yet another skirmish last week, and
as has been the case as of late, the hackers came out on top. The hacker
BtCB posted the new decryption key for AACS on the Freedom to Tinker web
site, just one day after the AACS Licensing Authority (AACS LA) issued
the key.' The article proposes a simple description of the protection
schema and a brief look back at how the cracks have slowly chipped away
at its effectiveness. It seems it'll be a long way to an effective
solution ... if any. One could also argue whether all that money spent by
the industry in this race will be worth the results and how long it would
take for a return on investment."

floating-point operations per second, known as a teraflop. That's a level
of performance that required 2,500 square feet of large computers a
decade ago. Intel first disclosed it had built a prototype 80-core

Gamespot reports on the final passing of New York senate bill A8696,
legislation proposed just last week, that now makes it [0]a serious
felony to sell or rent a violent game to minors. The bill makes it
illegal to sell a console without parental control options and
establishes a group to second guess the ESRB's rating decisions. "'This
bill is impermissibly vague,' EMA president Bo Andersen said in a
statement. 'A8696 seeks to apply real-world standards of violence to the
fictional and fanciful world of video games, an environment in which they
have no meaning. As a result, retailers and clerks will not and cannot
know with certainty which video games could send them to jail under
A8696. It was depressing to hear members of the Assembly note the
constitutional problems with the bill and then state that they were
voting for it.'" The senate seems to have no fear of possible overturn of
the bill, and claims it's only thinking of the children.

now reporting on a release put out by David Eick and Ronald Moore stating
that they will [3]conclude Battlestar Galactica at the end of Season 4.
They said it was a creative decision, and that they wanted to end the
show on their own terms. The show was always planned with a definite
beginning, middle and end, unlike many other sci-fi shows and dramas. Sci
Fi Channel has accepted the decision. The news had been foreshadowed this
spring through statements from stars Edward James Olmos and Katee
Sackhoff. Ronald Moore himself had said that the show was heading into
its final act, although he said the final act could be one or two more
seasons. Now we know that the final act will last for one season. The
special 2-hr. episode 'Razor' starts off the season in November. The
first regular episodes of Season 4 will air in early 2008."

An anonymous reader writes "It looks like DVRs and timeshifting has
finally done what many people said it would do: [0]increased overall
viewership! USA Today reports: 'Among the things the report revealed is
that many DVR viewers do not fast-forward through ads. The viewer total
for broadcast network ads goes up 32% when DVR watchers within three days
are included, according to Nielsen. For some prime-time shows, it means
that DVR viewing, long seen as a threat to advertising, could even bring
higher ad prices. NBC's The Office, for example, had a live-plus-three
Nielsen commercial rating of 3.36 — higher than the 3.11 it got for the
week of May 6 under the traditional Nielsen program rating system.' Makes
me wonder where this will lead for my favorite genre shows which by their
very nature have a [1]higher DVR component and have seen declining
viewership using the older methodology (BSG, SG-1, etc)."

The circle is now complete. With Turbine's release of Lord of the Rings
Online: The Shadows of Angmar (LOTRO), the Massively Mutliplayer game
figuratively eats the tail of its originator in ouroboros-like fashion.
Tolkien's work begat Dungeons and Dragons, the PC gaming market, CRPGs,
and finally Massive games, and last month's release of LOTRO beautifully
reconnects the future with the past. Replacing dice-wielding friends
around a table has even, wonder of wonders, been done well. Polished
gameplay and cutting-edge graphics abound; In direct contrast to the
lackluster response to Turbine's other MMOG, Dungeons and Dragons Online,
Lord of the Rings Online has had an overwhelmingly positive reaction from
fans. Read on for my notes from the experience of trying on Hobbit feet
for a month, and a few words about why LOTRO's quality is notable and
highly encouraging.

the latest [0]showdown between HD DVD and Blu-ray, with both formats
bringing out the big guns in terms of high profile format-exclusive disc

two 'Pirates of the Caribbean' films on Blu-ray — in the other, the HD
DVD exclusive releases of 'The Matrix' Trilogy. So who won the sales
battle? According to preliminary estimates, [1]this one goes to 'Pirates'
in a big way. The two 'Pirates' flicks sold an estimated 47,000 units,
while the 'Matrix' sets sold just about 13,900 units. Is this an
indication of movie quality, or another notch in the belt for the Blu-ray
format?"

carlos_J writes "Ars Technica is running a story about [0]RCTV, a
Venezuelan television station whose broadcast license was refused renewal
by the government. In response, [1]the station turned to YouTube to get
its message out. Says Ars, 'El Observador clips have been seen 175,000
times since May 28, and the channel is currently the most-subscribed
channel of the week. While putting the station's shows on YouTube is an
excellent idea, YouTube still lacks anything near the reach of
over-the-air broadcasts. But the use of the site to avoid censorship is
growing, and it's not hard to imagine a day in the near future when the
site (or sites like it) becomes as essential as local TV stations. As
that happens, YouTube will come into even more conflicts with governments
that have an interest in controlling what their citizens see, It's
already happening--Thailand's king, for instance, has a thing for iPods
but isn't too keen on YouTube. Will Hugo Chavez show more tolerance? '"

content that can run executables on their site, it can be subverted by an

Vicissidude writes with a link to a story on the Nature website,
discussing the discovery of a protein that may [0]enable us to sense cold
temperatures. It's been pinned down in mice, and the same protein may
perform a similar function in humans. Mice rely on a single protein,
called TRPM8, to sense both cold temperatures and menthol, the compound
that gives mints their cool sensation. The sensor also controls the
pain-relieving effect of cool temperatures, but does not seem to play an
important role in the response to painfully cold temperatures below 10 C.
TRPM8 is in the same family as the protein that detects heat and
capsaicin, the compound that makes peppers hot. These proteins lie in the
cell membranes of select neurons, and form channels that open and close
in response to external signals."
