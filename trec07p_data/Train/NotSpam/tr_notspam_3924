Hi,

No softspeech in the install unfortunately.  I thought of
giving this a go but the Debian iso loads very few drivers
in the initrd and the audio subsystem isn't one of them. 
The kernel used is 2.6.18 with the Debian patches as on the
official iso.  I'm hoping this will work with the Dectalk
but let me know if it doesn't and I'll add the new driver
recently committed into CVS.

The CD does not add any extra entries to sources.list not
added by the official image.

Hth,
Shane
