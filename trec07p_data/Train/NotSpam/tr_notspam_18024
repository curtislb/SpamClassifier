What I like about debian is that you don't end up installing stuff you don't
need.

If I had to use Linux in a work environment though, I'd pick Fedora for the
opposite reason: my employer would want me using an operating system that
was complete and they'd provide me a nice big hard disk to hold it all.

Since I run on budget computers, and I fool with and screw up the system a
lot I prefer slackware or debian.
