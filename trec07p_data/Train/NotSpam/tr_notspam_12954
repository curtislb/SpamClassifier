Hmmm, been away and got this...  I appreciate the effort but there  
wasn't anything, in principle, in MASS on this I didn't already  
know.  My question is just more about the functioning of the lm  
command and deriving these values.  I understand that its the wrong  
approach for repeated measures design and lme is more appropriate.   
But, I wanted to examine / compare.  So, my question still stands.   
How does one get something like the subject x effect interaction term  
from lm?

Also, while I'm at it, anyone familiar with Blouin & Riopelle on  
confidence intervals and repeated measures deigns?  Is there a reason  
the intervals() command should give me different values for the  
narrow inference confidence intervals than they get from SAS?
