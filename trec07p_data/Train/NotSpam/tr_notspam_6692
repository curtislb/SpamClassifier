Making news today...

* The "informal" Fred Thompson team "has kicked around names of potential top campaign aides, lawyers and pollsters who
might still be available given that so much of the Republican talent pool has already been scooped up. The team has
discussed securing office space for a headquarters in Tennessee." (New York Times)

Thompson "has not made a final decision but is on track to be ready to announce his candidacy in June or July."

Also, asked about his "colorful dating history from 1985-2002," Thompson told House members 4/18, "Yep, I chased a lot
of women... And a lot of women chased me. And those that chased me tended to catch me." (The Politico)

* The NRSC has created a web ad, "Dick Durbin - Lying to Us About Iraq?" which criticizes the senator for his remarks
about what the Senate Intelligence committee knew in the run-up to the Iraq war in 2002.

ICYMI: "Durbin kept silent on prewar knowledge" (Washington Times, 4/26)

* Speaking of seafood, asked his favorite food to cook, Sen. Chris Dodd (D-CT) said "an August New England dinner:
Lobster, corn and tomatoes."  Duncan Hunter said "Chicken fried venison." Bill Richardson said "diet milkshake." (AP)

>From advanced excerpts of his speech: "Our great power does not mean we can do whatever we want whenever we want, nor
should we assume we have all the wisdom, knowledge and resources necessary to succeed.	When we believe international
action is necessary, whether military, economic, or diplomatic, we must work to persuade our democratic friends and
allies that we are right.  But in return, we must be willing to be persuaded by them.  To be a good leader, America
must be a good ally."

a voting seat and Utah an additional seat in the House of Representatives.

DEMS TO MARK PASSAGE OF SPENDING BILL ON "MISSION ACCOMPLISHED" ANNIVERSARY: Democratic leaders in Congress are
planning a special ceremony on Tuesday afternoon to send President Bush a bill that sets timetables for troop
withdrawal from Iraq. The timing is no accident. It comes on the fourth anniversary of the day Mr. Bush stood on an
aircraft carrier under the banner “Mission Accomplished” and declared that major combat operations in Iraq had ended.
The Democrats’ ceremony, featuring the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, is part
of the elaborate political theater at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue surrounding the Iraq spending bill, which is
destined to produce only the second veto of Mr. Bush’s presidency. New York Times: Bill on Iraq to Be Delivered 4 Years
After Bush’s Words http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/01/washington/01cong.html

"SYMBOLISM AND THEATRICS": The showdown over the Iraq war moves from statecraft to stagecraft as President George W.
Bush prepares to veto congressional limits on military operations in Iraq. Today the Democratic Congress will send Bush
a funding measure that mandates a timetable for withdrawing troops. Bush's rejection of it is prompting both sides to
stage their actions for maximum dramatic effect, deploying symbols of patriotism and parading their military supporters
in carefully orchestrated events. Democrats plan a rare Capitol Hill "enrollment" ceremony, featuring House Speaker
Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, before sending the measure to the White House... "It's all about
symbolism and theatrics at this point," said Allan Lichtman, a political science professor at American University in
Washington. Bloomberg: Bush, Democrats Jockey for Advantage in War Funds Veto Standoff
http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=washingtonstory&sid=aDjYnWnz5nmw

AFTER THE VETO: Democratic leaders in Congress are slowly backing down from a standoff with the White House over tying
war funding to a troop-withdrawal timetable, saying they can use other bills to confront President Bush on Iraq. Senate
Majority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat, is courting Republican support for compromise war-funding legislation to
follow Mr. Bush's promised veto this week of a $124 billion bill that would start a pullout as soon as July. Senior
Democratic aides say that although House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is not similarly talking to Republicans about a post-veto
agreement, she privately acknowledges that eventually the "money will get to the troops without timetables."... House
Democrats are expected to attempt to override the veto this week, although they likely are at least 70 votes short of
the two-thirds majority needed to succeed. The failure of the House vote would make a Senate action unnecessary because
both chambers are needed to defeat a veto. Washington Times: Democrats conceding on war bill
http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20070501-121857-3393r.htm

BACK AT THE PODIUM: White House press secretary Tony Snow says he's looking forward to toasting Catholic University
graduates and an upcoming competition with his band, Beats Workin'. Then there's the matter of biweekly chemotherapy
sessions for four months, beginning Friday, to treat his latest bout with cancer. He had a cancerous growth on his
abdomen removed March 26. Snow, who returned to work Monday, said he plans to stay busy and won't shy away from
discussing how cancer has affected his life with others. "I'd much rather have help with it than go off in a corner and
be by myself," said Snow, who lost his colon to cancer in 2005. Snow, 51, wasted no time picking up a busy schedule: He
attended his reunion at Davidson College in North Carolina last weekend. Snow spent Monday greeting colleagues and
catching up. USA Today: Back on job, Snow looks forward to busy schedule

WOLFOWITZ SAYS HE WON'T "GIVE IN" TO SMEAR TACTICS BY RESIGNING: World Bank President Paul D. Wolfowitz said yesterday
that he is the victim of a "smear campaign" designed to portray him as unethical and an ineffective leader and that he
will "not give in to such tactics" by resigning. In a statement to a committee of the bank's executive board on
allegations that he violated bank rules by arranging a hefty five-year pay and promotion package for his girlfriend,
Wolfowitz said he had followed the institution's rules as he understood them. He said the effort to oust him is part of
a "conscious campaign" to undermine his reform efforts and "derail important programs... to aid the poor." Washington

RAHM HASN'T SLOWED DOWN: In his transition from the campaign trail into his newest role running the Democratic Caucus
in the 110th Congress, [Rahm] Emanuel is described by Democratic colleagues and aides as no less intense - all jokes
aside - than he was during his two-year turn at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and no less confined
to a single role in the leadership structure. “He’s still going at 85,000 feet with his hair on fire,” Rep. Ellen
Tauscher (D-Calif.) said of Emanuel. She later added: “What Rahm brings is this 21st-century, technology-age, go-go
attitude.”  The Illinois lawmaker, now in his third term, snagged his current title under an agreement brokered after
November’s elections by now-Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). The arrangement grants him broader responsibilities as
Caucus chairman than his predecessors in the post held, and avoided a potentially brutal intraparty fight as Emanuel
deferred a run for Majority Whip, the post now held by Rep. James Clyburn (D-S.C.). Roll Call: For Emanuel, One Title
but Lots of Jobs http://www.rollcall.com/issues/52_117/news/18252-1.html

WHICH NAMES ARE IN THOSE 46 POUNDS OF PHONE RECORDS? Deborah Jeane Palfrey ran her high-end sexual fantasy business in
a way she carefully designed to keep the feds at bay. (She didn't take a year of law school for nothing.) In
quintessential Washington style, the woman dubbed "the D.C. Madam" solicited male clients who paid up to $300 an hour
and hired some 130 subcontractors - women as young as 23 and as old as 55 - under detailed employment agreements that
required them to perform only lawful acts. That worked for 13 years, then she was indicted on charges of running a
high-class prostitution ring. Now, rather than keep her clients secret, she has decided to unmask them - in the name of
her legal defense. And she has elicited the help of ABC News to do it, turning over 46 pounds of phone records, a stack
about a foot high, with the names of "thousands and thousands" of clients that, Palfrey promises, reach "high into the
echelons of power in the United States." Los Angeles Times: Washington sexual fantasy service 'madam' unmasking clients

SEN. JOHNSON LEAVES REHAB CENTER: Having regained some of his strength and coordination, Sen. Tim Johnson was
discharged from a Washington rehabilitation center and is continuing his recovery from a brain hemorrhage at home, his
office announced Monday. Johnson's friend and former Senate colleague, Tom Daschle, said Monday that the South Dakota
Democrat has made remarkable progress since December, when he was rushed from his Capitol Hill office to the hospital.
When Daschle last saw him two weeks ago at National Rehabilitation Hospital in Washington, Johnson was doing well, and
his speech was coming along, Daschle said. The 60-year-old Johnson is up for re-election in 2008. Sioux Falls Argus

"I CERTAINLY HOPE THE STATE WILL FORGIVE ME," SAYS CORZINE: Remorseful over not buckling up but feeling "blessed" to be
alive, Gov. Jon Corzine left a Camden hospital yesterday, 18 days after he was gravely injured in a car crash. As two
of his children wheeled him out the front door of Cooper University Hospital, into bright sunshine and cheers from
dozens of assembled medical staff, Corzine exclaimed, "What a beautiful day." It was the governor's first public
appearance since the April 12 crash, in which he lost half the blood in his body and suffered 15 broken bones,
including 11 ribs and his thighbone. "I don't think people understand how much people care about others and reach out
and support them. I just want to make sure I say thank you," Corzine said, his voice hoarse with emotion. "I also
understand that I set a very poor example for a lot of young people -- a lot of people in general -- and I certainly
hope the state will forgive me." Newark Star-Ledger: FOR CORZINE, 'A BEAUTIFUL DAY'

THOMPSON ADVISERS INTERVIEWING "POTENTIAL CAMPAIGN MANAGERS": Advisers to Fred Thompson have begun exploring a range of
staffing options -- including talking to potential campaign managers -- as the actor and former Tennessee senator firms
up his plans to enter the Republican presidential contest, according to people involved in the conversations. Thompson
has not made a final decision but is on track to be ready to announce his candidacy in June or July, his advisers say.
Thompson has already been polling better than some of the announced GOP candidates, and his entry would shake up a
field that has left many Republican faithful dissatisfied. The Politico: Thompson mulling summer announcement

IS BLOOMBERG THE NEW PEROT? In 1992, Ross Perot's quixotic run for the presidency tapped into voters' deep worries
about the state of the country and unhappiness with the major-party candidates. The Texas businessman shook up the
race, capturing one of every five votes cast. Fifteen years later, the political winds that fanned the Perot candidacy
might be blowing once again -- this time stirring talk of an independent run by another billionaire, New York Mayor
Michael Bloomberg. "More people are willing to consider an independent today than in 1992," says Frank Luntz, a
Republican pollster who worked for Mr. Perot, and then for Mr. Bloomberg in 2001. He predicts the mayor could get as
much as 25% of the popular vote. Mr. Bloomberg, who is 65 years old, denies he is running, although the New York gossip
columns regularly quote "friends" claiming otherwise.  Wall Street Journal: Could Bloomberg Shake Up Race?

OBAMA HASN'T RAISED MONEY FOR CBC: Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) has failed to raise money for the Congressional Black
Caucus (CBC) even though it has been a year since he was asked to, and his main rival for the Democratic presidential
nomination has done so, CBC members say. CBC leaders asked Obama to hold a fundraiser for the caucus’s political action
committee (PAC) a year ago but they have slim hopes that he will come through for them. Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton
(D-N.Y.), Obama’s chief rival for the nomination, held a fundraiser for the PAC in March last year at the home of Dan
Leeds, a Washington venture capitalist. The Hill: Obama snubs Black Caucus

WOMEN SET "EXCEEDINGLY HIGH STANDARDS" FOR FEMALE CANDIDATES: For the first time in history, a woman has the
visibility, the reputation and the cash to make a serious run at the presidency. It would seem that Sen. Hillary Rodham
Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, would be in a solid position to parlay the female vote into success against an
all-male field in 2008. But women running for office face an unusual political conundrum: Women sometimes set
exceedingly high standards for female candidates. It's in part because some expect the first female president to be a
reflection of them, only better, said Mudle Wilson, president of the White House Project, a group that aims to
encourage women to lead in business and politics. AP via Yahoo! News: Women candidates face high standards
http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070501/ap_on_el_pr/electing_women

RUDY JUMPS THE GUN ON SOME NH ENDORSEMENTS: Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani released his latest slate
of New Hampshire supporters last week. One problem: Not all of them back the former New York City mayor. Alongside a
former state GOP chairman, a congressman and an executive councilor who do support Giuliani, a handful of people made
the list of 125 supporters despite their objections. Some are openly criticizing their mistaken inclusion. Others, who
did not want to be quoted or to embarrass the Giuliani campaign, have since decided to join it. Wendy Stanley Jones,
named a state co-chair for Women for Giuliani, said she was considering Giuliani, but also was weighing staying out of
the race because of a busy personal schedule. AP via Yahoo! News: Giuliani counts backers who aren't fans

MAKE FRIED CALAMARI, GAS UP YOUR SUV: Finally - a reason to revere all things greasy. Rep. Vito Fossella (R-Staten
Island) yesterday said he was cosponsoring federal legislation to double the tax credit for making biodiesel fuel from
recycled restaurant grease - a move he hopes will persuade eateries to turn the slimy stuff into environmentally
friendly fuel instead of paying to have it hauled away. "From cooking fried calamari to powering trucks, restaurant
grease represents a viable energy source for our nation," Fossella said at a conference held in Jody's Club Forest,
which forks over $25 for every 50-gallon drum of grease it must remove. Fossella said biodiesel fuel was already being
used in Staten Island and by the Parks Department in the rest of the city, to power the department's 650
diesel-operated vehicles and equipment. New York Post: S.I. POL'S BILL GREASING WAY FOR 'NEW' FUEL
