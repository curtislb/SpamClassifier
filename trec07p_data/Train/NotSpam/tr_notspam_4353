Lou Dobbs Tonight
Monday, April 23, 2007

Tonight, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid defies the president
on Iraq. Bush reiterates his support for U.S. Attorney General
Alberto Gonzales.

China is dominating the world’s production of Vitamin C. More
than 85 percent of the Vitamin C used in the United States is
imported from China. In light of the pet food contamination,
we’ll take a look at regulations on ingredients that go into
vitamins. We’ll also examine allegations of price fixing and
several U.S. antitrust lawsuits which claim that China has
cornered the market, driving up prices for Vitamin C imports.


If H1-B visas are truly meant to attract the best and brightest
in the technology sector, why is the program not basing who it
accepts on salaries and skill levels? Join us tonight for a
special report on the methods of acceptance for the H1-B visa
program. We’ll be examining new evidence of a trend of low wage
claims in the sector that represents the largest share of visa
holders.

The Mayor of San Francisco is fighting to keep his city a safe
haven for illegal aliens. Mayor Gavin Newsom declared over the
weekend that San Francisco is “a sanctuary city, make no
mistake about it.” Newsom said he will not allow any department
heads or anyone associated with the city to cooperate with
Immigration and Custom Enforcement’s raids. We’ll have a full
report.

The Border Patrol has lost confidence in Border Patrol Chief
David Aguilar. The top 100 leaders of the National Border
Patrol Council filed a no confidence resolution against the
Border Patrol Chief over his willingness to believe criminal
illegal aliens over his own agents in the case of former Border
Patrol agents Jose Compean and Ignacio Ramos. We’ll have that
report tonight.

The first presidential candidate to accept our offer of two
minutes of uninterrupted air time to discuss the issues
critically important to Middle Class Americans Rep. Ron Paul,
R-Texas joins Lou tonight.

Business, and Special Interest Groups Are Waging War on the
American Dream and How to Fight Back.” War on the Middle Class
is now on sale in bookstores near you and on Amazon.com and
