Hi ,
	Can somebody help me out ?

	I wanted to switch io redirection between log file and 
	standard display device.Basically sometimes I want to
	print into a log file and other time to the display device.

	To redirect I am using this 

	open (STDOUT, ">> TEST.log) 

	Two doubts here -
	1. I don't know how to reset it to default i.e to point STDOUT
to display again.
	2. Is there any better way of doing above ?

Thanks guys for all the help ...

AN.
