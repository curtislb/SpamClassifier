I see what you mean, but free software is not completely unrestricted by
the will of its copyright holder(s) who can, for instance, prevent it
from being merged with non-free code (by choosing a copyleft license).
However, enough permissions are granted on free software, so that
everyone has the right to fork it and adapt it to his/her own needs,
even against the will of the original copyright holder, as I already
said before.
In this sense, free software is "exempt from subjection to the will of
others".

In summary, I agree that the meaning of "free" in the context of
software freedom is an extension of the common meaning of the word, but
some interpretation and stretching has to be done in order to go from
the latter to the former.

Again, I cannot see the direct link between the word "proprietary" and
the concept of secrecy of source code.
Since I am not an English native speaker, it could be just lack of
English language knowledge.  Anyway, the Italian language has the nouns
"proprietario" (which means "owner") and "proprieta`" (which means
"property"): their definitions refer to the concepts of owning and
exclusivity, but not to secrecy...

I don't use it in that sense, you were the one who insisted on
consulting non-technical dictionaries and I simply did so.
The first common meanings of the word "proprietary" seem to refer to the
concept of property, owning, and trademark/patent/copyright.

So, what's your definition of "proprietary software", then?
Software with source code kept secret?

Just a nit-pick, not really interchangeably, because of semi-free
software.  I am deliberately neglecting semi-free software here.

Of course, as I said, my reference to FSF terminology was done just to
show that I am not one who woke up early in the morning and came up with
a brand-new definition of "proprietary" in the context of software
freedom...
My use of the term is similar to that of others.

I obviously agree that RMS saying something does *not* necessarily make
it true or correct.  I am *against* appeal to authority.
