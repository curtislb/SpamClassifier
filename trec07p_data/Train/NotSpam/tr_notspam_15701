I am packaging MyServer (http://bugs.debian.org/288655) and have a
question about the license in one file:

The Paul Hsieh licenses referred to are:

Note that mere excerpts by themselves (with the exception of raw source code) are not considered derivative works under this license. Use and redistribution is limited to the following conditions:

Is this DFSG-free? I couldn't find any references to this license in the
archives.

Thanks,
Paul
