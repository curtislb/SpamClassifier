8:30 PM, 6/6/07, Update: Severe storms batter Brevard County but no major i=
mpact at spaceport=20

Thunderstorms boomed and flashed across Brevard County late today, but engi=
neers at the Kennedy Space Center saw no signs of hail and pressed ahead wi=
th work to load the shuttle Atlantis with liquid hydrogen and oxygen to pow=
er the ship's electricity producing fuel cells. Launch on a space station a=
ssembly mission is scheduled for 7:38 p.m. Friday.

Torrential rain fell on Merritt Island late today and forecasters predicted=
 possible wind gusts higher than 50 knots and a chance for half-inch hail. =
A freak hail storm Feb. 26 damaged Atlantis' external fuel tank and repairs=
 delayed the flight three months.

As it turned out, the worst of today's weather appeared to miss the space c=
enter and no major problems were reported. A NASA spokesman said work to lo=
ad the ship's fuel cell system with hydrogen and oxygen was delayed about t=
wo hours by the weather, but by 8:30 p.m. engineers were ready to press ahe=
ad with the five-hour procedure.

They will make up the lost time as required during a four-hour built-in hol=
d scheduled to begin at 1 a.m. Thursday.
