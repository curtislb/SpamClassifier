Running Out Of Oil

Who Needs A Private Airbus 380?

My Favorite Solar Power Stock

-----

Is the world running out of oil?  In a strict sense, yes.  The earth's
natural process of manufacturing the stuff is very slow, and our ability
to use it up is relatively rapid.  Strictly speaking, we've been running
out since the first commercial oil well was drilled in Titusville,
Pennsylvania in 1859.

The better question is, "Are we in danger of running out of oil in the
near future?"  And the answer?  Depends who you listen to.

If you'd listened to Shell geologist M. King Hubbert, who devised the Peak
Oil Theory back in 1974, you'd have expected the peak of oil production to
come in 1995.

Obviously it didn't.

But peak oil talk is back in the news these days, mainly because, as in
1974, the high price of gas at the pump hurts.  Adding to the worries are
the questions about international politics, mainly in the Middle East. 
While back in the 1970s, the U.S. depended on other countries for a third
of its oil needs, today the number has grown to 56%.  And the world is no
more stable now than it was then.

So people are worried.

But a review of the current wisdom on the question reveals no consensus. 
There are too many variables - too many unknowns.

We know that oil production is in decline in 33 of the 48 largest
oil-producing countries.  We know that the peak of oilfield discoveries
occurred way back in 1965.  And we know that global demand has been
growing at a rate of about 2% in recent years, driven mainly by increased
demand from China and India, and to a lesser extent from emerging markets
in Africa.

The U.S. Department of Energy predicts the peak of oil production will
occur in 2037.  BP says the world still has enough "proven" reserves to
provide 40 years of consumption at current rates.  But you know these
institutions have an agenda to pursue.  In fact, it appears that most of
the participants in the global oil economy have a vested interest in
pushing peak numbers out as far as possible.

The oil companies, led by ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, PetroChina and
BP, all have an interest in inflating their "proven reserves."   
It makes their companies, and thus their stocks, more valuable.

Ditto for the producer countries. They all want to be perceived to be as
rich as possible, both to encourage investment by oil companies and to
assure their citizens that the future is bright.

Consumer countries as well want to reassure their citizens that the
outlook is equally rosy.  Thus the sanguine reassurances of the U.S.
Department of Energy.

So who do you trust?

I have a brother-in-law with a doctorate in geology who flies around the
world advising companies and governments where they can best find oil.  He
tells me there's plenty more of the stuff left in the ground, and that new
extraction techniques can easily keep our planet running on oil for the
rest of our lives.  But he doesn't address the costs of getting that oil
out of the ground.  And he's too smart to make a guess about peak oil.

As I said, there are too many variables.

So in the end we're left trusting the market.  The market, remember is
always right, because it integrates the opinions of all the participants
who have a financial interest in that market.

-----

But before I get to that, let me take a detour into the world of
perception, to comment on a few "thin reeds" that may shed light on the
picture.

Exhibit A is the United Arab Emirates, which in the past thirty years has
ridden a wave of oil money to become the 38th biggest economy in the
world.  In 2006, the country's GDP grew at a rate of 35%.  And the money
is flowing!  Its capital, Dubai, has an indoor ski mountain.  F1 racing is
coming.  The world's richest horse race takes place there.  And Tiger
Woods, who won the inaugural Dubai Classic this year, was recently hired
to design a golf course/resort in Dubai (its ninth).

Exhibit B is the news from the Paris Air Show that an individual "not from
the U.S. or Europe" had placed an order for a new Airbus 380 superjumbo to
use as a private jet.  The cost is over $300 million, and the smart money
says that's Arab oil money.

Exhibit C is the action in Congress, where Democrats this week tried to
impose nearly $29 billion in taxes on oil companies.  Why?   
Because that's where the money is.  But punitive economics is bad
economics.  Remember the Windfall Profits Tax? According to a 1990
Congressional Research Service study, the windfall profits tax (in place
from 1980 to 1988) "reduced domestic oil production from between 3 and 6
percent, and increased oil imports from between 8 and 16 percent."  I
don't think that's what we want.

All these exhibits, and more, combine to create a picture of an industry
enjoying good times.  But they make me wonder if we're nearing a peak of
oil money today.  As a contrary thinker, I'm wondering if it's brightest
just before the lights go out.

Increased Profits For 13 Cents Per Day!

When we could see that Apple Computer's earnings momentum was shooting
through the roof in October 2004, we named it Stock of the Month. It was
selling for a shockingly low $35 per share. Today, (adjusted for a 2-for-1
split) it has turned a $10,000 investment into $43,000.

There are 16 more Stocks of the Month I could name that have handed us an
88% average profit per stock over the past two years.

Join Cabot Stock of The Month and get in on the next stock that explodes,
like past picks Intuitive Surgical (up 600%), Broadvision (up 670%), and
Amazon (up 1,290%). Sign up today and you'll get immediate access to all
current recommendations, along with the free bonus report, Sector of the
Year.

Which brings me back to the market.  Today, oil stocks are strong across
the board.  Whether they're finding it, refining it or transporting it,
companies in the business are prospering today, and the stocks say the
good news will continue at least a few months longer.

In short, there's no worry about peak oil at present.

Of the five investment advisory letters Cabot publishes, four have
investments in oil companies.  The profits, like the oil, are flowing.

The one letter that doesn't have an oil stock is the one I edit, Cabot
Stock of the Month.  As the title suggests, it picks only one stock per
month, so it's particularly choosy.

And the stock I chose to play the energy bull market is not an oil stock
but an alternative energy stock, First Solar (FSLR).

Here's what I wrote back at the end of March.

"There are four big reasons why solar cells will be in high demand for
years to come. One, they provide non-polluting electricity, so they help
to reduce greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. Two, they
take advantage of the free energy that the sun provides, thus avoiding the
political complications of Middle East oil. Three, costs are falling fast,
as innovations in the field reduce the cost of manufacturing and increase
the efficiency of solar cells. And four, governments around the world,
working to reduce pollution and greenhouse gases, are introducing and
extending incentives that will accelerate adoption of the technology. All
told, we can't think of a single downside to the technology.

After waiting some 30 years since the first "oil shock," we're confident
that solar power is finally going to fulfill its promise. And we're very
excited about the investment opportunities in the industry,

Today, there are at least eight public companies in the industry. Most
boast triple-digit revenue growth, thanks in large measure to subsidies by
Germany that stimulated demand in recent years. Most are profitable, with
profit margins ranging from 11% to 20%. And with one exception, they're
based in either China or the U.S. Our favorite of the group is First
Solar, for two big reasons.

First is that it's the strongest stock of the group. Second is that First
Solar has a technological advantage. While most other companies build
their cells on slices (wafers) of silicon ingots, First Solar builds its
cells using thin-film technology. Doing this, it uses just 1% of the
silicon used by other manufacturers, a fact that frees it from serious
pricing pressures felt by the others, for whom silicon represents some 45%
of the product's total cost. These pressures stem from the fact that
silicon is the main component of semiconductors made by companies like
Intel, Motorola and SanDisk, and these companies pay a premium price for
premium product, leaving the solar companies paying through the nose for
the silicon needed to grow their business.

Another advantage to First Solar's thin-film technology, which uses
cadmium telluride (CdTe) as the semiconductor, is that it remains very
efficient at generating electricity at higher temperatures, while
traditional silicon cells see their performance degraded as temperatures
rise. Also, cadmium and tellurium are abundantly available in today's
world; tellurium is produced during the refining of copper, while cadmium
is derived from zinc smelting.

The company's cells, interestingly, aren't designed for home or office
installation; they're designed to replace power plants!"

Since that was written, First Solar has reported its first quarter
results, and they were terrific.  Revenues grew 392% to $67 million, while
earnings hit $0.07 per share, up from a loss of $0.08 the year before. 
Looking ahead, analysts expect a profit of $0.52 per share this year and
$1.12 next year.

And the stock is up 51% since my recommendation.

I have no target on the stock; the sky's the limit.  And right now, I'm
feeling pretty good about this one because First Solar is still the
strongest solar power stock in the market.

And that's impressive because the high times have attracted more IPOs to
the sector in recent months, so the competition for money in the sector is
escalating.  New players in the sector include LDK Solar (Chinese), Yingli
Green Energy Holding (Chinese) and Solaria Energia (Spanish).

But First Solar keeps on attracting new buyers!  One key reason - and this
goes back to the fact that it uses far less silicon in its solar cells -
is that First Solar promises to offer grid-parity pricing of $1.00 to
$1.25 per watt by 2010 or 2012, while maintaining operating margins of
25%.

Grid-parity means electricity generated by solar power cells will cost no
more than electricity generated by traditional fossil fuels.   
And isn't that the Holy Grail?

So should you run out and buy the stock?  Not necessarily.  Investing is
not that easy.  Now up above 80, the stock is at risk of pulling back to
its 25-day moving average at 70, or even its 50-day down at 68.  A
well-earned correction that took the stock down to that neighborhood would
certainly present a lower-risk buy point.

But it may not come.  And I say this because Thursday's defeat of the
extra taxes on oil companies also closed the door (at least for a while)
to nearly-matching incentives for alternative energy (taxing one industry
to support its competitor).   This was not good news for alternative
energy investors.  But the stock shrugged it off, climbing to new highs on
Friday!

My interpretation:  There are bigger forces at work here than the U.S.
Congress . . . and that's a good thing.

We've got growing global demand for energy, driven above all by the
booming economies of China and India.  We've got a growing demand for
clean power, to combat global warming and - in China in particular - to
combat pollution.  We've got peak oil . . . somewhere.  And we've got
political instability that threatens our growing need for imported oil.

Combine that "perfect storm" with improving technologies that promise
progressively lower costs of solar energy, and I think you've got a
winner.
