Subject: Modules for parsing emails

Since CPAN is pretty huge, I thought I would throw out a request for 
comments.

I need to parse email headers and the body of the email. The emails are 
supposed to be plain text only but sometimes someone goofs and sends one 
in HTML. I need to strip away the HTML elements and/or covert it to 
plain text to process.

What module(s) would you suggest I look at?

Robert
