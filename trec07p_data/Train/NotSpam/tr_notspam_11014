<SNIP>

The elaboration of particular strategies might be a good way of making
the plan even clearer and to avoid redundance and fragmentation.  There
is still a lack of transparency concerning policy priorities included
in each objective as well as confusion between targets and indicators
for each objective.  Also some important mandates of WHO are not
sufficiently reflected in the expected results, particularly in the are
of access to medicines, where the ongoing work of the Intergovernmental
Working Group as well as the mandate of WHO to assist countries in
using TRIPS flexibilities when necessary are not reflected in any of
the expected results.  The organisation's role in monitoring the
effects of trade agreements in the health sector and devising
strategies of needs-driven health research should be pointed out more
clearly.
