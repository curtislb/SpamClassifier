That's wishful thinking, at best. Common knowledge defines "fee" as
"something involving the transfer of money". If it isn't, then the GPL
is also non-free, by the very same rationale: the fact that you are
required to produce source when so asked if you do distribute binaries
from source under the GPL means that you are giving up a right ("the
right not to distribute any source") which you might otherwise have,
which could be considered to be a fee.

Hey, if we're going to accept leaps of logic, I can do one too.

Everyone who really cares about anything should do that anyway.
