Good going.  The more you can do without sighted help, the better.  I
have to bust all my computing problems without sighted help, which I
do not have the luxury of anyway.  My wife, though sighted, knows
nothing about computers and, showing her the messages or whatever,
would do no more than get her confused.  

Well, I just got the start of one going the other day.  I have decided
to give gnome and orca a try.  I may or may not regret this.  I would
like to get some results from others on how you are doing with this
combination.  I would like to see what's going on.  If you are having
good or bad results with speech-enabled Linux gui interfaces, please
let me know so that I will know what to look forward to.  



Thanks
