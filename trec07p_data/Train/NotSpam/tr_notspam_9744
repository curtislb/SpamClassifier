Thanks for your input.

Essentially, it's a very basic measure to ensure a user is actually
entering our ISP provided email address, so anything aside from
addr@mydomain.com should fail. (Of course as pointed out by Rob, it was
futile anyway as it was doing a 'contains' check as opposed to an
equality check.

This was more of an 'I don't understand why this var goes undef at this
time' thing.

Nonetheless, the docs contained the answer as per usual ;)

Thanks guys,

Steve
