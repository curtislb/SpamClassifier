Tridge has been working on chasing down the LOCAL-EVENT test on my build

Tridge promised Group Policy support, and I would like to see MMC able
to write to Samba4, but I wouldn't hold the release for either. =20

I'll chase down the issues with Vista joining Samba4 in the next few
days.  So far that's been the need to respond to the qfileinfo test,
which I'm extending to validate the properties of IPC pipes, and to
truncate the session key to 16 bytes.=20
