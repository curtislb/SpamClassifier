The initial idea of osc was to use it in sound applications but it does 
not mean it only works in sound applications. Memosono uses osc to talk 
to the game server and to the soundserver(which is activity wide at the 
moment) as well.

Each activity has an osc server running. I thought about inner activity 
communication. In memosono for example you may want to use the mesh 
network to play the game. In this case the person who shares the game 
will open a game server. The game server listens for osc messages from 
the other players (switched tile x etc) and uses osc messages to 
communicate the game state to the players.

The initial olpc-csound-server was started by an init.d daemon on 
startup. The idea to use csound as the olpc csound server has been 
deprecated afaik. Memosono was the only activity using this service. I 
have moved the sound server to the memosono activity and changed it to 
use osc messages to control it.
However if it is not used system wide the easier way is to create a 
csound instance in the activity and use it directly (assuming we have 
only one activity using the sound device at a time).

Best,
    Simon
