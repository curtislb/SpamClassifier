Hello list,I just installed ubuntu feisty on my own system, but I have a wifi internet connection system and I don't seem to find a way to make orca read the place to enter the wifi key. Have anyone of you had problems like this and can you please offer a solution? Also I'd like to ask, does the ubuntu feisty comes with speakup pached kernel and does the usp to serial adaptor works also with bns system synths?with regardsJürgen Dengo    _______________________________________________Speakup mailing listSpeakup@braille.uwo.cahttp://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup
