     Hello y'all,

     Just tried installing Slackware v11, and it was a darned good thing 
I knew about /proc/speakup/rate! <rofl>  I tried booting the speakup.i 
whatever, and it's not there; just the speakup.s file.  Rebooted Windows 
just to make sure it was on the install DVD, and it's snot.  So, I tried 
the speakup.s file just for the flock of it and it worked.  Only problem 
is that according to the docs, it's the SCSI kernal, and I'm running 
IDE.  I'm wondering if they packed the IDE modules into the .s kernal to 
save space.  Anyone tried installing Slack-11 off DVD lately using 
speakup.s on an IDE system?  TIA,

         Michael
