Debian generally distributes OpenSSL logically near the packages that
dynamically link against it, so the major system component option is
not available to Debian ("... unless that component itself accompanies
the executable").

GPL section 3(a) also uses "accompany" in a way that Debian and others
interpret to include distribution in the same directory tree on a
particular server, so -- the usual line of reasoning goes -- it would
be inconsistent to interpret "accompany" one way at the start of
section 3 and a different way at the end of section 3.
