<B>Coming up this Sunday on Reliable Sources:</B>

<B>Same Story, Different Day?</B>

Some very serious journalists are releasing two new somewhat critical books on Hillary Clinton.  Is this big news, or are the media just singing the same old song about the Presidential candidate?

<B>ABC's Iran Report</B>

ABC came under criticism from some politicians and public after the network lead World News Tonight this week with a story about covert U.S. activities in Iran.  Was the news division jeopardizing national security, or just doing their jobs?

<B>War-Funding Coverage</B>

Many in the media said there were not enough congressional votes to pass a bill requiring benchmarks for withdrawal from Iraq.  When the Democrats backed down from the benchmarks this week, were reporters eager to issue a big I-told-you-so?


<B>Plus,</B> Robin Roberts: the morning show host talks candidly about her life, religion and making choices that effect her career as a journalist.

<B>Join us this Sunday and every Sunday at 10am ET / 7am PT for our critical look at the media! </B>
