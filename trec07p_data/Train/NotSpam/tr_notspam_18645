9:27 PM, 6/12/07, Update: Station gyros resume attitude control; blanket re=
pair decision deferred=20

A Russian navigation computer aboard the international space station hung u=
p today, triggering a chain reaction of computer miscues in the midst of wo=
rk to unfurl two huge new solar blankets.

The arrays were successfully deployed, but the computer glitches forced fli=
ght controllers to maintain the station's orientation using shuttle rocket =
thrusters instead of the lab's stabilizing gyroscopes. That, in turn, resul=
ted in a less-than-desirable attitude and a loss of solar power from a left=
-side array, which could not properly track the sun. Work to reboot the Rus=
sian computers also apparently triggered a false fire alarm that briefly pr=
ompted concern on the ground.

Late today, flight controllers at the Johnson Space Center in Houston came =
up with an untried technique for switching orientation control back to the =
station's control moment gyroscopes without going through the Russian comma=
nd-and-control computers. The gyroscopes can safely control the station's o=
rientation to maximize power generation without the stress, strains and exh=
aust plume contamination that goes with using rocket thrusters.

But moments after switching back to the gyros, an alarm sounded and flight =
controllers asked shuttle commander Rick Sturckow to re-enable Atlantis' di=
gital autopilot once again while engineers worked on an alternative approac=
h.

"Our attempt to take attitude control obviously didn't work," astronaut Meg=
an McArthur radioed from Houston. "We'll be working on a secondary plan and=
 will get you words as soon as we have a plan."

Joel Montalbano, a mission operations manager at the Johnson Space Center, =
said Atlantis had plenty of rocket fuel and, in a worst-case scenario, coul=
d maintain the orientation of the combined vehicles for a full week if nece=
ssary.

But engineers were confident it wouldn't come to that and by 9 p.m., they h=
ad successfully re-established gyroscope control and the left-side array wa=
s tracking the sun as required.

Computer glitches aside, program managers were thrilled with the successful=
 deployment of the new S3/S4 solar arrays on the right side of the space st=
ation's main power truss.

"As a program guy, I'd be remiss if I didn't tell you what these solar arra=
ys mean to us," said Mike Suffredini, NASA's space station program manager =
at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. "This set of solar arrays will prov=
ide about 20 kilowatts of power to the international space station. That's =
useable power. It provides quite a bit more than that, but some of it is si=
phoned off to take care of its own systems.

"That equates to something like eight to 10 households," he said. "So it's =
a significant amount of power we bring to the space station now. In additio=
n to that, it's going to allow us to take our next steps, which begin early=
 tomorrow morning and that'll be the retraction of the 2B array."

The station's power system includes four sets of solar arrays, two on each =
end of a truss that eventually will stretch more than 300 feet from tip to =
tip. A set of arrays known as P4 was added to the left side of the truss la=
st September and the Atlantis astronauts added the S4 arrays that were unfu=
rled on the starboard side of the truss today.

A third array - P6 - was launched in 2000 to provide power during the early=
 stages of construction. NASA plans to move P6 to the left end of the power=
 truss later this year. One of its two solar wings - P6-4B - was retracted =
during a shuttle flight last December. The other wing - P6-2B - is schedule=
d for retraction this week.

But the December shuttle crew ran into major problems retracting P6-4B and =
ultimately had to stage an unplanned spacewalk to coax the blankets back in=
to their canister.

This time around, the astronauts plan a slower, more deliberate approach, g=
iving the array more time to settle out between retraction attempts in a bi=
d to ensure the blankets fold smoothly. If they don't, astronauts Patrick F=
orrester and Steve Swanson will provide manual assistance at the start of a=
 planned six-and-a-half-hour spacewalk. The primary goal of the excursion i=
s to complete the activation of a rotary joint designed to keep the new S4 =
arrays face-on to the sun.

Back at the Johnson Space Center, engineers are testing different technique=
s for securing a pulled-up insulation blanket on Atlantis' left-side Orbita=
l Maneuvering System rocket pod that was spotted after launch Friday. The s=
huttle crew's mission has been extended two days and a fourth spacewalk add=
ed to allow time for repairs.

John Shannon, chairman of NASA's Mission Management Team, said today he has=
 not yet decided which repair technique to use or even when to use it, hold=
ing open the options of attempting the blanket repair during the third spac=
ewalk Friday or deferring it to a fourth and final excursion Sunday.

One technique calls for a spacewalking astronaut on the end of the shuttle'=
s 50-foot-long robot arm to push the blanket corner down and sew it to an a=
djacent blanket using steel thread. Another technique calls for the astrona=
ut to use a surgical stapler to secure the blanket. Another option is to si=
mply push the blanket down and leave it at that.

Shannon said tests will be conducted overnight in a wind tunnel in Californ=
ia and furnaces at the Johnson Space Center to see which repair technique h=
olds up best in the re-entry environment.

Otherwise, Shannon said, the shuttle's heat shield appears to be in good co=
ndition. Engineers are still assessing post-launch "spikes" in data from wi=
ng leading edge impact sensors on the shuttle's left and right wings.

"Last night, there was a one-G indication on our wing leading edge impact d=
etection system," he said. "Last night it was the sensor between the right =
(wing) panels 11 and 12. The day before we got a one- half-G reading on the=
 sensor between left panel 7 and 8.

"On previous flights, we've had several indications exactly the same. We do=
n't exactly understand what is going on. We think we're getting some therma=
l settling, or thermal deformation of the support structure to the wing lea=
ding edge. People don't feel like it was an impact because no other sensors=
 around that area pick it up. There's no ringing of the structure at all, j=
ust kind of a little click."

After Atlantis undocks from the space station next week, the astronauts wil=
l conduct a now-standard "late" inspection of the shuttle's heat shield "an=
d if there were anything in those areas we would pick it up," Shannon said.
