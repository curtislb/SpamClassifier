They're also computed as part of the anova.mlm(...test="Spherical") route.

Something is en route to R News, I hope....

Aov, lmer, and anova.mlm with the Spherical option all fit essentially 
the same model, but lmer has less fine control over small-sample 
properties and the effect of departures from the assumptions (partly 
because it needs to deal with unbalanced data).

Lme with an estimated covariance matrix is similar to anova.mlm without 
assuming sphericity. They are often less powerful than the 
sphericity-with-correction alternative, because of the larger number of 
estimated parameters. The balance should shift in "large N, small p" cases.
