Hi,
I use the Google Groups to read the postings and have posted a few
times in the past.
When you post, a little warning banner at the top the page says:

"The group you are posting to is a Usenet group. Messages posted to
this group will make your email address visible to anyone on the
Internet."

Am I banished forever?
Ken Slater
