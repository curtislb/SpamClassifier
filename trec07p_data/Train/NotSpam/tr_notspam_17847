Well, one of the main objections to the Novell-Microsoft contract from what I 
understand is that Microsoft has promissed not to pursue Novell or Novell's 
customers for any violation of Microsoft patents.  According to FSF, if I 
understand it right, this is unfair because it only protects a part of the 
GPL users and not everyone.  Any such license should, according to them, 
apply to all or none.

I suspect that they are trying to be "practical" and don't want to chase after 
users in "technical" violations where there is no intent to subvert Open 
Source objectives.

Yes. They have a fiduciary licence arrangement with us (me).  The project can 
decide what license it will use.  There is a certain amount of mutual 
consentment, but there is no question that they are not going to (and did not 
when I told them) complain about removing modifications to the GPL.

So it is clear, I do have the right to license the software anyway I want, but 
of course, if I license it differently, that would be a fork or a special 
deal, and might not hold for the project, which is dedicated to Open Source.  
FSFE also has certain rights and obligations.  99.9% of it is spelled out on 
their web site.

I believe that doing what you suggest would modify the GPL, and I don't want 
to do that since it puts me according to FSFE and Red Hat in violation of 
other people's licenses.

Yes.
