Brazil to issue compulsory license for Efavirenz

For the first time, Brazil issues a compulsory license for a drug. The president of the Republic, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, signed on Friday (04), in Brasília (DF), a decree to sanction the compulsory licensing of the antiretroviral drug Efavirenz. The company that holds the patent for the product, Merck, had been given seven days in which to make new proposal after the Minister of Health, José Gomes Temporão, declared the drug to be of public interest by signing Ministerial Ordinance No. 886 on April 24th. During this period the laboratory offered a discount of 30% on the current price of US$ 1.59 per tablet paid by the Federal Government. This proposal was considered to be unsatisfactory, since Brazil would be able to obtain the product elsewhere for US$ 0.45.

Compulsory licensing enables the Ministry of Health to import generic versions of Efavirenz from laboratories that are prequalified by the World Health Organization (WHO). The quality, safety and effectiveness of the imported drug offered to Brazilian patients are guaranteed by the bioequivalence and bioavailability tests required to be performed. Currently, three Indian laboratories meet the WHO requirements, namely: Cipla, Ranbaxy and Aurobindo.

The antiretroviral drug Efavirenz is the most used imported drug in AIDS treatment. Currently, 38% of AIDS patients take Efavirenz as part of their treatment scheme. It is estimated that by the end of this year, 75,000 of Brazil's 200,000 AIDS patients will be taking the drug.

At the current prices charged by Merck in Brazil, the annual cost per patient is equivalent to US$ 580, representing budgeted expenditure of US$ 42.9 million for the year 2007. The prices charged for the generic product result in an annual cost per patient that varies between US$ 163.22 and US$ 166.36. Based on these amounts, under compulsory licensing, expenditure reduction in 2007 will be around US$ 30 million. Savings of US$ 236.8 million are estimated to be made by the year 2012, when the Efavirenz patent expires.

The decision of the Brazilian government is in absolute compliance with international requirements and with Brazilian legislation. Compulsory licensing in the public interest is taken to be a legitimate and necessary measure to ensure that all patients who are provided with Efavirenz via the Ministry of Health's National STD and AIDS Programme have access to it.

Public interest - Compulsory licensing is a flexibility provided for by article 31 of the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement (TRIPS Agreement). This practice is used by developed countries, such as Italy and Canada in relation to pharmaceutical products and also by developing countries. In the case of antiretroviral drugs, Mozambique, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand have already made use of this provision. Furthermore, Thailand recently issued compulsory licensing for Efavirenz.

 In Brazil, compulsory licensing can be implemented in the event of circumstances provided for in the Brazilian Industrial Property Law, such as the abusive exercising of patent rights, the abuse of economic power, absence of local production, unsatisfactory commercialization, national emergency and public interest.

In the case of the antiretroviral drug Efavirenz, compulsory licensing has been granted based on the public interest in the light of the need to ensure the viability of the National DST/AIDS Programme. Compulsory licensing in the public interest must be granted for non-commercial use, non-exclusive production, and temporarily for a fixed period of time, although it may be extended and remain in force for as long as the public interest exists. It must be emphasized that independently of this the remuneration due to the patent holder remains ensured.

History of the National STD and AIDS Programme

The Brazilian National STD and AIDS Programme (NAP) came into existence following the publication of Ministerial Ordinance No. 236, in May 1985, three years after Brazil's first AIDS case was registered, and when the world still knew very little about the disease, considered at that time to be a "gay cancer" or "gay plague ". By the end of the 1980s, however, it was discovered that there had been an AIDS case in the city of São Paulo as early as 1980.

Following the onset of the epidemic, the constant development of new drugs has lead to a significant increase in the life expectancy of people living with HIV by stemming the multiplication of the virus. The drugs delay the appearance of the symptoms of the disease and slow down the reduction of the immune system's protective cells. Even so, they are not able to eliminate HIV.

Long before the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on HIV/AIDS (UNGASS HIV/AIDS) recommended that efforts to combat the AIDS epidemic should be wide-ranging and inclusive, having a balance between prevention, health care and the promotion of human rights, in addition to the active participation of people living with the disease in decision making processes, the Brazilian STD and AIDS Programme was already working in this way. Such pioneerism - which is a fundamental feature of the NAP - has been an example to several different countries around the world, principally least developed countries.

Civil society participation was made official in 1986, with the setting up of the National STD and AIDS Committee (CNAIDS). Ever since the creation of the CNAIDS the representation of civil society organizations has been guaranteed by ministerial ordinances. With effect from 1994, Ministerial Ordinance No. 1,028/GM has ensured the participation of five representatives of non-governmental organizations on the Committee, thus enabling civil society to collaborate with the Committee's discussions and activities. The representatives are indicated by civil society itself, by means of elections held during the National AIDS Service NGOs' Congresses which take place every two years.

The first medication used to contain the progression of immune deficiency in AIDS patients was AZT (Zidovudine), in 1987. By 1991 AZT was already being produced in Brazil. In the same year AZT began to be distributed by the National Health System (NHS), although without universal access. AZT proved itself to the effective in the prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission. The following year the World Bank forecast that 1.2 million Brazilians would have HIV by the year 2000. Today, 15 years later, Ministry of Health studies estimate that Brazil has 600,000 people with HIV.

It was in 1996, however, that an important victory in the fight against the disease was achieved. The Federal Government sanctioned Law No. 9,313/96, proposed by Senator José Sarney, which ensures free access to antiretroviral (ARV) drugs via the NHS to all AIDS patients. In the same year Brazil also began using combined treatment, commonly known as "cocktail" treatment. The combination of ARV drugs stems the progression of the disease and avoids the deterioration of the immune system. The number of AIDS deaths fell drastically following this new form of treatment.

Over time this strategy has shown itself not only to be effective, from the point of view of reduced mortality rates, but also efficient in saving resources, since expenditure on AIDS in its early stages costs less than repeatedly admitting seriously ill patients to hospital.

Ever since 1996, the National AIDS Programme has held periodic meetings with specialists in the treatment of the disease to determine parameters for the treatment and monitoring of people with AIDS. The treatment consensuses that are reached are published in documents that serve as guidelines for doctors who treat AIDS patients and well as for the purchase of the drugs by the Programme itself.

In 1997, the national production of antiretroviral drugs was begun and the price of imported drugs began to fall, so that by 2002 there were price reductions of up to 83%.

The Brazilian defence of universal access was taken to the 1998 World AIDS Conference in Geneva, when the Minister of Health put forward the proposal that universal access to antiretroviral drugs is a human right, based on the positive results achieved with the country's anti-AIDS policy. 1998 was also the year in which Law No. 9,656 came into force, making it compulsory for private health plans to cover AIDS related hospital expenses.

In 1999 Brazil introduced genotyping tests to identify resistance to anti-AIDS drugs. In the same year pregnant women began taking rapid detection tests to find out their HIV status at childbirth in order to complement examinations carried out during antenatal care.

One year later, in Durban, the National STD and AIDS Programme made a firm stance among developing countries in defence of the production of generic drugs for AIDS treatment. This stance caused worldwide debate about patents and price abuse on the part of the pharmaceutical industry. In 2001, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) awarded Brazil a prize in the category "Human Rights and Culture of Peace", in recognition of the activities undertaken by the Programme.

Another political decision that caused worldwide repercussion was the Ministry of Health's refusal to receive funding from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) owing to its not accepting the exclusion of sex workers from intended AIDS related actions and the imposition of the United State's ABC policy (Abstinence, Be faithful, use a Condom, if necessary).

The appearance of cases of people resistant to anti-HIV treatment has lead the Ministry of Health to introduce and invest in new drugs that, in turn, are patented and expensive. In 2003, for example, R$ 551 million were invested in the purchase of antiretroviral drugs. In 2006, expenditure was more than R$ 960 million - almost double the amount spent in 2003. Most of this increase was due to the purchase of patented drugs.

Brazil has faced pressure from the multinational pharmaceutical industry which, protected by international patent legislation, charges blatantly abusive prices for the new drugs, as is the case of antiretroviral drugs. The production of generic medication is an important arm for the Brazilian government in negotiating with the pharmaceutical industry. Eight of the seventeen ARV drugs currently distributed by the NHS are produced nationally.

Background to the negotiations - In August 2001, the then Minister of Health, José Serra, requested the compulsory licensing of the Nelfinavir patent (made by Roche). The decision was taken following nine months of negotiations with the laboratory. However, on the same day as the announcement was made, the Minister further announced that the process had been interrupted. This happened because Roche agreed to reduce the price of the drug by 40%.

In December 2003, Health Minister Humberto Costa announced that compulsory licensing could be adopted for the production of Nelfinavir in Brazil. On that occasion, Humberto Costa explained that he expected to negotiate with Roche, but that compulsory licensing would be decreed if necessary. In January 2004 the Health Minister was successful in obtaining a price reduction for five drugs: Nelfinavir, Lopinavir, Efavirenz, Tenofovir and Atazanavir. The agreement resulted in a 37% reduction in the prices previously paid for these antiretroviral drugs.

In June 2005, the President of the Republic, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and the Minister of Health, Humberto Costa, signed a declaration of public interest in relation to the antiretroviral drug Kaletra (Lopinavir + Ritonavir), made by Abbott Laboratories. In July of the same year, the Minister of Health issued a statement on the conclusion of the negotiations with Abbott, which ensured a reduced price for the drug for six years, access to the new Kaletra formulation (known as Meltrex) and the transfer of the technology for the formulation of Lopinavir + Ritonavir. The laboratory agreed to reduce the unit price of Kaletra capsules from US$ 1.17 to US$ 0.63 each, with effect from March 2006, representing a saving of US$ 339.5 million between 2006 and 2011.
