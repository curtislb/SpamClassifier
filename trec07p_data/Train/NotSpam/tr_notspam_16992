The "Report on Steps to be taken by Government of  India in the context of Data Protection Provisions of Article 39.3 of the TRIPS  Agreement" was submitted on 31 May 2007, on the last working day of the outgoing  Secretary of the Department of Chemicals and Petrochemicals - Satwant Reddy -  who was one of its two primary authors (the other was Gurdial Singh Sandhu,  Joint Secretary in the same department).

  It is available publicly at http://chemicals.nic.in/DPBooklet.pdf.

  At close to 60 pages, the report attempts to balance  several conflicting positions. Perhaps that explains why - the day after  submission - newspapers reported such widely differing interpretations.

  On June 1, the Economic Times said: "Multinational  drug makers like Pfizer, Glaxo and Novartis can look forward to delaying the  entry of me-too versions of their new drugs in India for five years.....It  recommends a five-year data exclusivity period for pharmaceuticals and  three-year exclusivity term for agrochemicals with a series of safeguards to  prevent its abuse."
  (http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/News/News_By_Industry/Healthcare__Biotech/Pharmaceuticals/Pfizer_Glaxo__Novartis_will_have_to_wait_to_launch_generic/articleshow/2093016.cms)

  The same day, Mint wrote: "Domestic pharmaceutical  companies have won a significant victory, with a key committee of the government  declining to change drug laws that currently allow them to make copycat versions  of drugs by effectively using data filed by the patent-holder. The committee has  refrained from granting drug makers exclusive use of chemical, test and other  data they file with regulators while applying for drug approvals. Instead, it  has recommended that data submitted by a drug maker be treated as a trade secret  and get the same legal protection accorded to such confidential  data."
  (http://www.livemint.com/2007/06/01234358/Govt-backs-local-drug-cos-on-d.html)

  Subsequently, the Hindu and the Business Standard  offered their appraisals of the report.

  (http://www.hindu.com/2007/06/04/stories/2007060401361300.htm)
  (http://www.business-standard.com/common/storypage.php?leftnm=lmnu2&subLeft=1&autono=286458&tab=r)

  Part of the reason there is confusion over what the  report actually recommends is the arcane nature of the issue (data protection)  and the arcane nature of the recommendations themselves, which are couched in so  many alternate (and differing) scenarios that it is difficult to tell exactly  how the report will be implemented into law in the long  run.

  So what does this report actually  say?

  There are three sections to the recommendations - for  pharmaceuticals, for agro-chemicals and for traditional medicines. For the  latter two categories, the report recommends immediate data  exclusivity.

  With respect to pharmaceuticals, the recommendations  are split into two stages. For now, the report recommends that data be protected  as a trade secret, with explicit changes made to the Drugs & Cosmetics Act  to allow this, as well as changes to the procedures for submission, storage and  handling of such data. In a nutshell, this is the "data protection" model which  is somewhat similar to   Brazil, and close to the effects of similar  provisions in Argentina.

  The report then recommends a "transition period" -  which is unspecified - to move to a 5-year "data exclusivity" system. This data  exclusivity system comes with safeguards, which at first glance appear to be  generally more comprehensive than those implemented in models elsewhere in the  world.

  The report says that both the transition period (if  it should be, and for how long) as well as the subsequent data exclusivity are  "subject to further discussions." One reading of this is that the report's only  actionable recommendations for pharmaceuticals pertain to a data protection  regime, to be implemented immediately, and nothing further. If - and when -  government decides to tackle the speculative sections of the report, it may be  assumed that a subsequent committee will decide on whether, and how, the  transitional period and data exclusivity will fall into  place.

  Another reading is that, as such, the recommendations  are final. What is to be delibarated is merely the length of the transition, as  well as the fine tuning of the safeguards.

  Either way, there is some confusion as to where this  could lead. But why a transition period at all? The report makes it  unambiguously clear that a data-protection system fulfils the minimum  requirement of TRIPs. That is to say, the first step of its recommendation  satisfies the criteria it was originally tasked to deliver on: as to what  Article 39.3 mandates vis-a-vis data protection.

  It further goes on to provide reasons why this would  work well for India:

  6.2.4: "Positive Impact: (A) It will allow greater  competition to take place by not giving monopoly rights to the innovator drug  companies on the non-patented drugs. This will help keep a check on the prices  of these drugs. (B) It will help greater availability of generic drugs as the  domestic companies will continue to make generics of the pioneer drugs (not  under patent) since the Drug Regulator will continue to rely on the data  provided by the first applicant while approving the subsequent applicants for  similar drugs."

  Then it goes on to describe the "Negative  Impact"

"a) It may have some adverse impact on FDI in pharmaceuticals  sector in India since the perception with most international corporates may be  that Indian does not provide adequate IPR protection to new products (b) This  may slow down the early launch of some of the new drugs in India for lack of  adequate protection."

  If data exclusivity can harm the Indian public and  the Indian economy now, as the report makes explicit, it is not clear at all as  to why it won't in - say - 10 years' time. Nowhere is this explanation provided  except for a weak analysis by the authors’ to conclude that data exclusivity  will lead to increased pharma FDI to India, and the “early launch” of international  drugs.

  What we are told – quite clearly – is that this  committee would have liked to recommend data exclusivity today, if not for the  fact that MNC pharma public relations just hasn’t done its job: “this  [transitional] period can be utilized to educate the public and industry so as  to allay their apprehensions on the issue.”

  Apparently a few years plus a lot of money will  provide us the education we need and the foresight we require to “allay  apprehensions.” But just for the record, and before MNC spin-doctors get to  telling us what we should think….

  ***

  The logic that data protection only – the immediate  recommendation – is “unfair” is spurious. For one thing, the proportional  investment made for clinical trials for  India (specifically) is often so low that it is  recouped several times over by premium pricing and early entry by the  originator. That is to say, there is absolutely no need for any further  incentive other than the market itself.

  Consider Gleevec, a drug  that has been much in the news. Gleevec earned Novartis $2.5 billion in 2006.  Novartis reports that it had all of 45 paying patients from  India during the  year. At a cost of $2600 per patient per month, Indian sales represented 0.05%  of the world market. If we accept the overblown $150 million cost of clinical  trials, it means that the fraction of this cost attributable to  India is roughly  $82,500. As such, the payment by the first 3 patients for the drug would cover  the cost of clinical trials – assuming a 90% profit in comparison to the generic  price.

  Or we could consider  Plavix – a blockbuster heart medication marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb and  Sanofi-Aventis that earned them a whopping $6.3 billion in 2006. Retail sales  data of Plavix tells us that the first 25 patients in  India would  adequately compensate the cost of clinical trials to bring this drug to market  in India.

  An odd twist is that  India is rapidly becoming a very important  location for clinical trials outsourcing. Because of lower costs pharmaceutical  companies are looking to use India to reduce clinical development timelines  so as to be able to launch their products sooner in the  west.

  Pharmaceutical FDI is  generally not dependent on data exclusivity provisions. The experience of  several countries around the world suggests this. An in depth study of Jordan's  data exclusivity implementation (Oxfam 2007) as part of its bilateral treaty  with the United States found that there was 'no FDI by foreign drug companies  into Jordan since 2001 to synthesize or manufacture medicines in partnership  with local generics companies', and the only FDI was setting up sales offices.  For the 13 major trading partners of the  United  States for which pharmaceutical  FDI is available easily there is no clear pattern as to the impact of  implementing data exclusivity laws. For 6 of the 13 countries, real foreign  direct investment fell in the three years including and following the  implementation of data exclusivity compared with the three years preceding it.

  India, as a growing  consumer market for pharmaceuticals is already - and will continue to be - a  destination for MNC pharma.

  ***

  The most serious problem with this report is that the  “safeguards” it envisions for the data exclusivity to come, are, in fact,  largely meaningless. What’s worse is that they are couched in language that might lead  people to believe otherwise.

  Two minor points first.

(1) To exclude “drugs  for life threatening diseases such as HIV/AIDS” from data exclusivity, as the  report suggests, is an interesting safeguard. It would be even more interesting  to understand exactly what prescription drugs this committee finds  non-life-threatening: that list would undoubtedly be very small. To make this  safeguard work, the committee would have to exclude virtually every existing  drug in the Indian market (well, except perhaps drugs for erectile dysfunction,  baldness and insomnia).

  (2) Data exclusivity with safeguards doesn’t seem to  stay that way. Once data exclusivity is in, it usually gets worse. If  India is considering the idea of data  exclusivity to stave off pressure from the USTR, in the form of the Special 301  Report that the US releases annually, it might want to  reconsider given Canada’s experience. A mainstay on USTR’s  special 301 report since 1995, Canada (despite allowing 5 year data  exclusivity) drew much censure for allowing generics to be pre-approved before  they could be marketed, among other things. The USTR only let off on  Canada – on this score – after that country  pushed data exclusivity upwards to 8 years and removed some of the  safeguards.

  The major point next.

  The safeguards that the Reddy Report recommends  appear to be, on their face, comprehensive – so comprehensive, in fact, that  some may conclude at first blush that all of the pre-existing “fears”  surrounding data exclusivity have been adequately addressed by these  safeguards.  Upon closer analysis,  however, it becomes clear that the safeguards are both unworkable and  incomplete, and have the potential of undermining the real public health  safeguards that exist in our patent law.

  The first safeguard, for instance, states that data  exclusivity will only apply to those new chemical entities discovered on or  after 1 Jan 1995.   Presumably, this will prevent those drugs that were patented in other  countries prior to India’s entry into the WTO in 1995 from  obtaining a market monopoly.  Sounds  good in theory, but rarely, if ever, is the picture so straightforward.


  Take, for instance, the antifungal drug lubiprostone,  which was approved by the US FDA in 2006.   A query in the FDA’s Orange Book shows that there are not one, but five  patents associated with this particular drug.  Look up each of these patents in the US  Patent and Trademark Office website, and you discover that they were all filed  on different dates, and that two of the five were actually filed (and thus  “discovered”) pre-1995, while the remaining three were “discovered” in 1999,  2000, and 2002.  Then consider that  of the 5 patents listed in the Orange Book for lubiprostone, 4 relate to a “new  method of treatment” and “new form”. All of these patents relate to the drug  that was approved as an NCE.

  So is lubiprostone an NCE? And was lubiprostone  “discovered” prior to 1995? Or in 1999? Or in 2000? Or in 2002?

  If the answer here is that the Drugs Controller must apply data exclusivity as soon as  s/he sees even one patent that was filed after 1995, then the safeguard is  really no safeguard at all.  In a  forthcoming paper (that we are currently completing), we looked into the US  FDA’s drug approvals for “new molecular entities” from January 2005 to present,  and the patents associated with each drug in the Orange Book.  Of the 36 NME approvals during this  time, 22 of them (61%) had patents associated with them that were “invented”  prior to 1995.  However, all but  four of these drugs also had other follow on patents associated with it in  addition to the original pre-1995 patent.

  That the vast majority of new drugs have not one, but  several patents associated with it is hardly surprising, and is merely a  confirmation of the well-known problem of “evergreening” that Parliament  intended to discourage with the enactment of section 3(d) and other safeguards  in the Indian patent law.  However,  this particular “safeguard” of making data exclusivity only applicable to drugs  “discovered” after 1995 would perversely create the incentive for drug companies  to file for and obtain frivolous follow-on patents on older drugs, precisely so that it  could also qualify for data exclusivity.

  The alternative - and equally unpalatable - solution  would be for the Drugs Controller to examine the numerous patents associated  with any given drug, and to make a substantive determination as to whether a  given patent should be “counted” for data exclusivity purposes.

  But then the question arises:  How, exactly, is the DCGI qualified to  make substantive decisions regarding patents?  With all due respect to the DCGI’s  office, it simply lacks the capacity, resources and bandwidth to make judgments  on such a difficult topic as patent law.   Indeed, even the US FDA has acknowledged that it is simply not competent  to make any judgments on the validity of patents, and that forcing it to do so  would only cause further delay and confusion: “The [FDA] believes that, even if  it had the authority and expertise (which it does not), such a review would not  speed the availability of generic drugs. Rather, it would instead add a layer of  complexity and delay, leading to litigation between FDA and the generic or  innovator, in addition to any litigation between the generic and  innovator.”  [Testimony of Daniel  Troy, Chief Counsel, US FDA, before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary,  1.8.2003; available at
 http://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/t030801.html]

  Thus, this seemingly simple and straightforward  safeguard, on closer inspection, turns out to be either a perverse incentive to  engage in evergreening or an unworkable and unbearable burden placed upon the  DCGI that is likely to result in even further delays.

  The Reddy Report also recommends as a further  safeguard, that “in the case of data protection for patented drugs, the period  of protection should in no case go beyond the 20-year period of patent  protection in India.”   However, the phenomenon of a data exclusivity period extending beyond the  20-year patent term is a relatively rare occurrence.  Among the 36 FDA approved drugs that we  examined, we found only one instance in which the exclusivity period would  extend beyond the term of the last-to-expire patent.  [Paliperidone, a treatment for  schizophrenia, was approved in 2006 and granted data exclusivity until  2011.  However, the lone patent  listed for this drug will expire in 2009.   Thus, data exclusivity would give two additional years of market  exclusivity after the patent expires.]

  Thus, this “safeguard” is largely a red herring to  distract our attention away from the far larger problem:  Data exclusivity will also be conferred  on those drugs that have no patent protection at all.  The Reddy Report quietly sneaks this in  on p. 5, stating that “Data Protection [read: data exclusivity] is required both  for patented as well as for non-patented drugs..,” while conveniently neglecting  to mention this key fact in the recommendations.  However, the impact of making data  exclusivity available for unpatented (or unpatentable) drugs is hard to  overstate, particularly in India, where Parliament has enacted several  safeguards to ensure that frivolous patents are not granted.

  A large percentage of  “new” drugs coming in to the market would not qualify for patent protection in  India. This means  that if data exclusivity were in place, Indian patients (and the section of the  generic drug industry that caters to the domestic market) would be denied access  to use or production of these drugs.

  For instance, Section  3(c) of the Patents Act prevents the patenting of “any living thing or  non-living thing occurring in nature.”   In 2005, the FDA approved a chemical  called exenatide for the treatment of type-2 diabetes.  Exenatide, however, was not created in a  laboratory. In fact, it was discovered in the venomous saliva of the gila  monster, a poisonous lizard found in the wild deserts of the western  United  States and  Mexico.  Nevertheless, the United States Patent  and Trademark Office duly granted it a patent.  Luckily for the 62 million Indians who  live with type-2 diabetes, lizard spit would not gain patent protection in  India. However,  Exentaide also has data exclusivity in the  US until  2010.

  Section 3(d) of the  Patents Act, as has been made famous by the ongoing Novartis litigation, prevents  drug companies from getting a new patent by creating a new “form” of an already  existing drug, unless this new form makes the drug more effective. However, a  lesser known but equally important clause in section 3(d) states that a new use  of an already known compound cannot be patented.  In other countries, drug companies  routinely obtain patents on new uses of known substances.  For instance, the US FDA approved a drug  called deferasirox in 2005 as a treatment for iron overload.  For those who require frequent blood  transfusions, such as people with severe anaemia, an excess of iron can build up  in the body, often leading to severe organ damage and even death.  Deferasirox is a derivative of a  chemical that was known and used for some time as an herbicide.

  Novartis discovered that  this chemical could also be used for treating iron overload, and obtained two  separate patents in the United  States for this new use.  However, due to the ban on the patenting  of new uses of known compounds, Novartis would again be unable to gain patent  protection on this product in India. However,  Novartis also owns data exclusivity on deferasirox – which doesn’t expire in the  US until  2010.

  An invaluable weapon in  the evergreener’s arsenal is the ability, once the active ingredient has been  discovered and patented, to obtain a new patent, some years later, on the  “composition” of the final drug product.   Patent offices are inundated with patent applications seeking a 20-year  monopoly for combining an already known active ingredient with a variety of  commonly used inactive substances to obtain the final product –whether in tablet  form, injectable solution, transdermal patch or other dosage form.  These “innovations,” of course, often do  nothing to increase the efficacy of the active ingredient, and serve very little  purpose other than to extend the patent life of the original drug patent.  However, Indian law severely restricts  the ability of drug companies from engaging in such practices with section 3(e),  which excludes from patentability “mere admixtures” that result in a product  that is nothing more than the sum of its parts.  An example of
 such practice can be seen  in the recent US FDA approval of anidulafungin, an antifungal of potential  significance in treating the most commonly encountered AIDS-related  opportunistic infections.  With the  original patents on this drug set to expire in 2012, a subsequent patent  application was filed in 2002 that claimed a formulation combining the active  ingredient with “an aqueous solvent.”   The “aqueous solvent,” the patent goes on to explain, can be either  “water or saline.”

  Luckily for us, the  original patents on this drug are too old to be patented in  India, and section  3(e) would prevent the patenting of the later “invention” of combining a drug  with salt water.  American consumers  are not so lucky.  They will have to  wait until the expiration of the second patent in 2022 before they can access a  cheaper generic version of this drug. Indian consumers would be lucky as well to  access generics immediately, barring the data exclusivity on this product, which  lasts till 2011 in the US.

  MNC pharmaceutical  companies routinely disguise their claims of a new use of a known compound with  clever language stating that they have discovered new “methods of treating”  human beings by administering the already known product.  This has been an extremely successful  tactic for drug companies to recycle old compounds for newly discovered  uses.  However, section 3(i) of the  Indian Patents Act states that “any process for the medicinal…or other treatment  of human beings” cannot be patented.   This is welcome news for those suffering from multiple myeloma, a rare  form of blood cancer that is almost always fatal.  The US FDA, in 2005, approved  lenalidomide as a treatment for multiple myeloma.  The active compound that forms  lenalidomide, however, was known as far back as 1972.  Despite this, there are eleven patents  covering this drug in the U.S., all but two  of which are “method of treatment” patents that would be invalidated by section  3(i) of the Indian
 law. (The other two, by the way, are “composition” patents  and would be invalidated by 3(e)).

  Thus, instead of waiting  until 2023 for an affordably priced generic to enter the market, those suffering  from multiple myeloma can entertain the hope that an Indian generic will develop  a cheaper version soon. But lenalidomide comes with data exclusivity that only  expires in 2010 in the US.

  Indeed, when we examined  the patents associated with the 36 NME approvals from 2005-2007, we found that  up to 80% of these drugs would come with patents that would not be valid in  India.  Of the 110 patents that are attached to  these 36 NMEs, we found that as many as 96 of these patents would fail under one  or more of the safeguards that have been implemented in our patent act.  Of these, only 18 of them would be  invalid simply because they were filed prior to 1995.  The remainder of them would be  invalidated on one or more of the other safeguards that exist in this  act.

  ***

  As these numbers show,  the safeguards in the patent act, if rigorously and correctly applied, have the  potential to invalidate many bad patents that create wholly unjustified  monopolies.

  However, with the  introduction of data  exclusivity – even with all of the  alleged “safeguards” that are detailed in the Reddy Report – these stringent  patent provisions would be rendered meaningless.

  In conclusion (this is  merely a preliminary note prompted by the release of the Satwant Reddy Committee  Report) we strongly suggest that government take no further action on either  the transitional period, or the eventual data exclusivity suggested, until the  empirical evidence is assembled, analysed and thoroughly  examined.
