I'm sorry, but I don't get why anyone considers that an ad hominem attack.

Uh, dude, "IANAL" is a way of indicating that you may not actually have
a clue what you're talking about because it's all just amateur opinions.
Once upon a time -legal used to be littered with it; now days the concept
that regular posters to -legal might be mistaken seems to be rather alien.

See, given that as an ftpmaster I'm one of the folks who actually
implements the policy on what's accepted into main or not, it's not my
loss at all.

The CDDL primarily applies to Debian rather than end-users anyway, being
about distribution and development (at least in so far as we distribute
CDDL software anyway)...

In any event, the example Don raised specifically talked about Debian
being the respondent.

It's interesting that you started the mail offended about the "ad hominem
attack" of noting you're not a developer; yet somehow you think a computer
expert who tries to avoid paying attention to legal arguments getting
"subpoena" and "summons" confused is an ignoramus who shouldn't be
taken seriously.

And that is exactly an ad hominem fallacy -- attacking the person in
order to discredit their arguments, even though the flaws the person
may have don't actually affect their argument.

The argument which, I'll note that you didn't actually address at all.

It doesn't matter, simplicity isn't a requirement for freeness.

Disclaimers of warranty and liability do that too.
