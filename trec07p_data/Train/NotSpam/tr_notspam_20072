- From what i gather it's not building with  .22 in general though i could
be wrong. However, not building on x86-64 does effect a lot of users,
because a lot of the blind folks  i've talked to lately are using amd64
and other similar systems.

actually, most gentoo users use the gentoo-sources kernels because they
have several aditional patches. You are right in that gentoo users can
use an older livecd to install the system, which is what i suggest
people do since any newer releases won't be able to talk because of the
speakup support being removed.

You are right, that is the problem here. Williamh and i talked a great
deal before he wrote that email. While i don't like this idea, i think
it's time that speakup be put into user space as daniel has said in the
bug. If you really must have the boot omessages you can get them from
dmesg, or at worst, use the kernel config option to get your kernel to
dump panics in swap space, stick the machine on a livecd and get the
panics that way. Unfortunately, i'm with daniel on this one i really
think it's  time to put speakup into user space.
