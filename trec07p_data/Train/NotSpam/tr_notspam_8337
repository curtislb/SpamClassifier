I think part of the problem is the 'shift'ing that I was doing. I am 
looking into that. Basically I was shift'ing the @log out of existence 
after the first pass.

Basically 1 id will create 2 lines; line 1 of the log for a particular 
id is the "what" and line 2 is the "why". I am trying to get at the 2nd 
line.

What does that give you? I have never heard of that and have never had a 
problem the way I have shown. Just curious...
