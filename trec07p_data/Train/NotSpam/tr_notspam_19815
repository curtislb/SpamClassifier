Java and Javascript are two different animals, I personally 
think that Java is a great tool for generating content, as in 
running servlets that generate TEXT, not the flawed applet
idea with its crazy security implications. Javascript is not 
the same, and I wish it would just not exist. It is used for
all the wrong reasons. The only reason it does exist is 
because Sun allowed Netscape to create a scripting 
language based on Java, but is not Java, in order to help
proliferate Java on the web. It was bad decision for Sun.

Java is very useful as a technology, for networking code 
on embedded devices, and for server code. I have 
written powerful server based apps that when you view 
the pages they are text, but the text is generated by Java,
this is very powerful, but completely different than the 
Javascript fiasco. There is no need for Javascipt, Java,
DHTML, or any other "dynamic" content languages on 
web pages. There are too many risks involved and too
many restrictions on how the information can be used.
I'd like to see new standards evolve out of W3C.
