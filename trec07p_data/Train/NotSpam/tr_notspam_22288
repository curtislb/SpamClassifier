SatCon to present Invited Paper at 2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society
General Meeting




BOSTON, Jun 25, 2007 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- SatCon Technology Corporation(R)
(Nasdaq CM: SATC), a developer and supplier of power management and
system architecture solutions for the alternative energy and distributed
power markets, today announced that it will be presenting at the 2007
IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting in Tampa, Florida, this
week. The theme of this year's Annual General Meeting is "Powering the
Future, Today". SatCon's presentation and paper is titled "Advanced
Semiconductor Impact on Distributed Generation, Energy Storage and the
Utility Grid". 

"In this era of energy resource depletion, energy supply fragility, and
increasing concern over the environmental consequences of our fossil
fuel based economy, the IEEE Annual Meeting is focused on these critical
concerns," said Dr. Leo Casey, Chief Technology Officer of SatCon
Technology Corporation. "Our paper at the Annual meeting addresses the
great advantages in efficiency and reliability that are derived from
distributed, and in particular, renewable-distributed generation.
Building on our experience as a leading provider of Utility Scale
Photovoltaic and Fuel Cell Inverters, we also present the value
enhancement that is derived from the addition of sufficient storage to
the intermittent renewable resource. The ability of advanced
semiconductors, such as Silicon-Carbide, to impact this value
proposition by enabling robust MicroGrids is the unifying conclusion of
this presentation."
