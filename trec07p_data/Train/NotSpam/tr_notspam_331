[0]Roland Piquepaille writes "The launch of the Orbital Express mission,
with its two satellites ASTRO and NextSat, the first one servicing the
other, was widely covered a month ago. But what is happening in space
now? In '[1]Robotic satellite servicer rehearsal underway in orbit,'
Spaceflight Now reports about the progress done. A week ago, the two
satellites were able to link to each other to operate the first transfer
of hydrazine fuel from ASTRO's propellant tanks into NextSat. This
weekend, ASTRO's ten-foot-long robotic arm is going to be used to move
objects to NextSat. But what does it mean for international satellite
operators when they need help with their space birds? Will they use a
system designed for U.S.'s DARPA? "

Via [0]a Wired Blog, an anonymous reader wrote with a link to a post on
the Geek Technique website. There, post author Mark Hoekstra details
[1]how to replace an iPod's HDD with flash memory. It's not an
inexpensive procedure, as 16 Gigs of flash memory is still a mite
expensive, and the post is not a 'how-to'. Just the same, the project
took painstaking work and is well worth recognizing. "I guess I can say I
found ways of eliminating almost every hard drive out of almost every
hard drive based iPod thereby eliminating all moving parts. The only one
left is the iPod video which would only need a slightly different
adapter. But next to that I've got a gut feeling that one's being
upgraded to flash memory by Apple themselves any time soon."

An anonymous reader writes: "On the Wired site, Clive Thompson has up an
article that points out a sobering truth: [0]gamers are getting older.
Folks who grew up playing videogames like Doom and Quake are now facing
parental decisions with their own kids regarding appropriate content.
Thompson cites well known gamer dads like Kotaku's Brian Crecente,
discussing some of the approaches folks educated in gaming take with
their own offspring: '"Everybody knows, as an adult, that the world is
not always a nice place," Crecente told me. "But I don't want him to know
that yet. I want him to have a childhood." So he disallows games with
"realistic" combat, like World War II titles, or Resistance: Fall of Man,
but permits highly cartoony shooting, like Starfox on the Nintendo DS --
since he regards it as essentially as abstract as playing cops and
robbers with your fingers as guns.' Where do you think gamer parents
should draw the line? If you have kids, what approach are you taking to
introducing them to gaming? How old is 'old enough' to start fragging?"

of them are ideal in all situations. The online MySQL documentation is
extensive, but the most commonly needed nuggets are buried in its
necessarily exhaustive contents. Third-party MySQL reference books can
winnow out some of the rarely-used minutia, but they still encompass
hundreds of pages, reflecting the complexity of the subject. For quickly
looking up the most frequently used command syntax and other details, a
MySQL user would usually be best served by a much more compact book, such
as MySQL Pocket Reference." Read below for the rest of Michael's review.

CowTipperGore writes "Founded by William Shockley in the mid-50s,
[0]Shockley Semiconductor Lab is generally credited with starting the
Silicon Valley boom. When he was unable to lure his former Bell Labs
coworkers to join him, he filled his ranks with the best and brightest
engineering school grads, including Zombie Moore and others who later
went on to form Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel. The building at 391
San Antonio Road, Mountain View, California, is the original site of the
company but, unlike the [1]HP Garage, this building has received little
protection or preservation. It recently housed a fruit stand, where
visitors could find a small display about Shockley above baskets of
fruit. [2]The fruit stand is now closed, leaving the future of the
building in the air."

at PC world, indicates that [0]the iPod has sold over 100 million units.
It also asks how many are broken and replaced which makes me believe the
number may be more accurate."

(7 days more than the original deadline of April 10) to 'explain to a
judge [1]why it lost e-mail records that could provide proof that the
chip maker used anticompetitive practices as alleged by Advanced Micro
Devices Inc. (AMD).' According to an order from Vincent Poppiti, the
special master hearing negotiations of the case, the court is looking for
an accounting of Intel's document preservation problems and a proposal
for a better solution for archiving future records."

[1]alleged Google improperly tapped its database for its Pinyin IME
product, stirring controversy on whether two databases were similar just
due to normal research process. Today [2]Google admitted that its new
product for Chinese market 'was built leveraging some non-Google database

Sohu shared several common mistakes, where Chinese characters were
matched with the wrong Pinyin equivalents. In addition, both dictionaries
listed the names of engineers who had developed Sohu's Sogou Pinyin
