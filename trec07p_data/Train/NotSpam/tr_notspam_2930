Spie, 
The only time/place I ever heard KB singThe Long and Winding Road was 
recently on the video on YouTube.   My guess is somebody at that radio 
station discovered it there also.

>> I heard Kate singing The Long and Winding Road in a salon in Mudletta
>> Georgia. It was part of an 80's/90's alternative satellite station.

>That's pretty strange, as that's only available as an obscure, grainy
>bootleg.  Or was that one of the tracks that appeared officially on a
>semi-official Japanese fan-club flexidisk?  I wonder how they would have
>gotten hold of one of those.
