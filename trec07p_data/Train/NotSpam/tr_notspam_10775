Well, it must be seen *if* upstream actually have the right to license
them under the GNU GPL...

It depends on what you mean by "remake".

If the "remake" is an independent reimplementation of the basic idea of
another game (similar game mechanics, similar rules, similar game goals,
and the like), then I think the "remake" is entirely copyrighted by its
author(s): no problems here.

If the "remake" copies copyrighted elements from the other game
(characters, story/plot, dialogs, or, worse, graphics/sounds), then I
think the "remake" is actually a derivative work of the original game
and its author(s) need(s) permission from the original game copyright
holder(s) in order to license the "remake" in some way or another.

The usual disclaimer: IANAL, corrections from more knowledgeable people
always welcome.
