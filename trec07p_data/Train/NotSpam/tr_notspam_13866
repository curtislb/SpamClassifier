Hello,
    The swspeak script run after boot was what I refered to.  Coming from a 
Gentoo system, I'm mostly used to setting things like speechd-up and 
speech-dispatcher to start on system startup, and having the sftsyn support 
compiled directly into the kernel.
    Maybe the GRML people have a specific reason for doing this the way they 
do?
Thanks,
Zack.
