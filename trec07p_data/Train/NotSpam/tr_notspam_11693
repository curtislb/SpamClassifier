Dear Friends,


  Today, the Sankalp Rehabilitation Trust, an organisation that provides treatment and rehabilitation support for injecting drug users, filed a post-grant opposition against Roche’s patent for the hepatitis-C drug peg-interferon á2a, marketed by Roche as Pegasys.  The patent for Pegasys was the first product patent granted in India under the new TRIPS-mandated product patent regime, and is only available from Roche at the price of Rs 2.25 lakh (US$ 5,625) for a 6-month course.  In the hope that an absence of patent protection will spur generic competition to bring down the price of this much-needed drug, Sankalp decided to file an opposition against Pegasys.


  Hepatitis-C represents a huge public health problem in India.  An estimated 12.5 million people in India are infected with the hepatitis-C virus (HCV).  Left untreated, hepatitis-C can lead to liver cirrhosis, liver cancer or liver failure.  Hepatitis-C is especially pernicious for those co-infected with HIV, as several studies have shown that HIV-HCV co-infection leads to increased rates of disease progression.  Injecting drug users are especially vulnerable to HIV-HCV co-infection.  For instance, a study in the Northeastern state of Manipur reported HIV-HCV co-infection rates as high as 93% among injecting drug users.   However, due in part to its high cost, hepatitis-C treatment is not available in government hospitals.  Indeed, we have been told that treatment programmes are not even bothering to screen for HCV due to the unavailability of treatment.


  Roche’s patent for Pegasys involves combining interferon – a naturally occurring protein with antiviral effects that has been known for years – with a structure called polyethelyene glycol (PEG), an inert substance that helps to prevent the interferon from being broken down by the body, thus allowing it to remain in the bloodstream longer.  This technology of combining interferon and other biologically active proteins with PEG had also been known for years prior to this patent.  In fact, the technology embodied in Roche’s patent is essentially identical to that disclosed in an academic paper that was published a year prior to the filing of Roche’s patent application.


  The opposition to the patent for Pegasys was based on these grounds.  Patent protection is only granted to inventions that are new and involve an inventive step.  Sankalp has argued in its opposition that the patent was wrongly granted, because given the state of the existing knowledge at the time of the grant of patent, the “invention” that Roche was claiming was neither new nor inventive.  Rather, Sankalp has argued, the patent is an attempt to obtain a monopoly over technology that existed in the public domain.  Sankalp has also invoked some legal provisions that are unique to Indian patent law, including the assertion that Roche’s alleged “invention” is at most a “mere admixture” of known substances and unpatentable under section 3(e) of the Patents Act, and that it is just a “new form of a known substance” and not patentable under section 3(d) of the Act.
