1. Use New Agent Appointment Form 2678; Discard Prior Versions

Employers, payers and agents should begin using the May 2007 revision of Form 2678, Employer/Payer Appointment of Agent, and discard prior versions to avoid delays in getting IRS approval. The redesigned and retitled Form 2678 contains several enhancements that clarify and simplify the authorization process.

Download Form 2678 from IRS.gov, or call (800) 829-3676 to request copies by mail. Instructions and the IRS mailing address are included with the two-page form.

2. Offering Money Services?  Register with the Government

Businesses offering money services including wire transfers, currency exchange, money orders, traveler’s checks, and check cashing may be required to register with the U.S. Department of Treasury.  

Businesses have 180 days from the date they begin operating as an MSB to register using FinCEN Form 107, Registration of Money Services Business. The registration is good for two calendar years and is renewable by December 31 of the second year using the same form. 

Civil and criminal penalties may be imposed for failure to register. 

FinCEN Form 107 can also be ordered by calling (800) 829-3676.
