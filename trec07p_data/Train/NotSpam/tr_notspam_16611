I like the idea of automatic change notification.  Would it be too 
labor-intensive to have a broadcast-only mailing list for the 
notifications, instead of a single maintainer's email address?  In at 
least AbiWord, there may be multiple people capable of resolving an 
issue, and so a mailing list would permit those interested to sign up to 
be notified on a granular basis.
