It looks as though your data is delimited by "};\n\n".  Is that
correct?  That is, each "block" of text ends with that string, and you
want to only print out the first instance of each block?  You can
control Perl's notion of what a "line" is via the $/ variable.  See
perldoc perlvar for more information.

To only print one instance of any given block, use a hash.  Each time
through your read loop, check to see if that block is in the hash.  If
it is, don't print it.  If it's not, do print it, and then add it to
the hash.  For example:

#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;
open my $fh, '<', "infile.txt" or die $!;
open my $ofh, '>', "outfile.txt" or die $!;
local $/ = "};\n\n";
my %printed;
while (my $record = <$fh>) {
   print $ofh $record unless $printed{$record}++;
}
__END__

Hope that helps,
Paul Lalli
