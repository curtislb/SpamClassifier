In terms of the wiki, due to automated spam, we just need you to send
wiki-editor at samba a short mail with your username, and you can get
edit privileges. =20

But I'm wondering:  What are you trying to achieve with this program?
Forcing CIFS access via the Linux kernel's smbfs (in particular) seems
to be a very good way to break things, even if the aim is to create a
security proxy.  (At the very least look into the cifs vfs kernel
filesystem).

The point is that the POSIX interfaces provided by the Linux kernel are
good, but not good enough to create an actual CIFS proxy.  We just loose
too much information in the translation process.

Perhaps have a look at Samba4's CIFS proxy ntvfs backed?

But I don't want to discourage you too much:  The idea of a Linux proxy
for vulnerable windows machines is I think very valuable.=20
