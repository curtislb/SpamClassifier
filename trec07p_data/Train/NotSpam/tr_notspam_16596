Yes; choice of venue is better written as "if you distribute the
convered work, you agree for all suits covering the work to be held in
Berlin, Germany."

Considering Sun's apparent interpretation though, they could easily
rewrite this clause to be in the position of resolving abiguities of
jurisdiction, or a defensive only jurisidiction clause. Either would
resolve my personal problems with the CDDL, and I believe would solve
the problems most -legal contributors have with the license.
