Take a look at Perl6::Form*.  It is the replacement for the built-in
format engine of Perl 5.  Your code would look something like:

print "$cust\nTicket ID                      Subject
  hh:mm\n", '-' x 65, "\n";
for my $tkt (@tkts) {
    print form
        "{>>>>>>}   {[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[} {>>}:{>>}",
        @{$tkt}{qw/id messafe hour minute/};
}
