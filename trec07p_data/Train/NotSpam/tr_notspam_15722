So, with this, the terms require that the redistributor must license
under the terms of the GPL, with no further restrictions.

If this license requires restrictions additional to those in the GPL,
then it is GPL-incompatible and cannot be redistributed under either
license.

This restriction is additional to the GPL. The result is
GPL-incompatible and cannot be redistributed under either license.

This restriction is additional to the GPL. The result is
GPL-incompatible and cannot be redistributed under either license.

This quite clearly is not compatible with the GPL: both licenses
require that the work be distributed only under their terms, thus both
cannot be simultaneously satisfied.

Worse, I don't think the work can be legally redistributed at all.

Any of the problems noted above in the text of the Paul Hsieh
Exposition License make the combined work unredistributable, since one
cannot satisfy both of GPL and the Paul Hsieh Exposition License
simultaneously.
