It's good to make sure that Debian Live desktop images matches the
Debian Desktop users needs. I think that in the group you will be able
to:

* More than have voice on the mailing list, rw access our svn being
able to prepare 'live flavored artwork' based on our debian-moreblue
update

* Make sure that the set of desktop related packages fit a live user need

and more. ;)

Yeah, and I thought g-i was on track. Do you think that it will be
more like "win32 loader" or "ubiquity" in terms of usability ?

'live-to-hdd' as in 'the same thing you're running here live on your
hd', ubiquity-like, right?

This is like 'debian as you want it -to-hdd' and not simple
'live-to-hdd'. In other words the live cd would work simple as a g-i
bootstrap and not only as a live cd + ubiquity, but both options would
be way better.
