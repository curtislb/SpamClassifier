I love debian. I guess we all do here.

Recently, thoguh, I had to switch to Kubuntu =only= because wireless on my laptop JUST
WORKED.

I have an HP zt3000 with one of those Intel PRO/Wireless 2200BG wireless cards built in.
It has been horrible to try to get working despite any instructions found on the
Internet. The instruction on the site for this (http://ipw2200.sourceforge.net/) was
tricky as it only focused on getting that one piece working and not networking as a
whole.

DistroWatch (http://distrowatch.com/) has had ubuntu at the top of their list going back
to 2005 - its ashame when I know that debian is really the heart and soul of dopey
ubuntu. 

Im sure debian would shoot to the top of the list if a few more things (like wireless) 
"just worked" like it does with my Kbuntu.

Couldn't someone work on this problem for debian - or talk to the ubuntu people to get a
copy to be included in the next release and apt sources?

Somethings I don't mind figuring out and there is a great sense of accomplishment; but
getting wireless working is not one of them.

~david (and many other debian users I talk to)
