@drew: it was opensourcecinema that was using the ccmixter engine in an 
early version.
@andy: brett's site is now built on drupal though. its got more 
features that he needed. and is in more active development.

that project goes into documenting much of free culture background etc 
but from the perspective/focus on remix, mashups, music.

cheers matt
