  Currently, for historical reasons, an EToys "project" is saved into
a file (relatively small, but can be big if you use a lot of media)
called a project file or (".pr" file).  The file can be passed around:
If the user type an URL for a .pr file into XO's browser, it fetches
the file from the server and launch Etoys with it.  In short, you can
just think that a .pr file is a document file for the Etoys
application.

  We do have a higher-level document format (document formats, to be
precise) and thinking to migrate that.

  Also, we are almost ready to merge the drag-and-drop code that lets
the user to drag an Etoys object onto the frame, and paste it into
Write and other activities (and vice versa).  This drag-and-drop code
lets the user copy and paste text as well.
