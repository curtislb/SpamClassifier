Thai, U.S. Officials Have Not Reached Agreement About Compulsory
Licenses For Patented Drugs, Thai Health Minister Says

Medical News Today
28 May 2007

Meetings held on Monday between Thai and U.S. officials concerning the
issuance of compulsory licenses to produce several medications,
including two antiretroviral drugs, in Thailand were "fruitless," Thai
Health Minister Mongkol Na Songkhla said on Tuesday, the Bangkok Post
reports. Mongkol and senior executives from Thailand's Public Health,
Commerce and Foreign Affairs ministries met with U.S. officials on May
21 and May 22 to explain the country's policy on compulsory licenses
(Treerutkuarkul, Bangkok Post, 5/23).

The Thai government in November 2006 and January issued compulsory
licenses to produce lower-cost versions of Merck's antiretroviral
Efavirenz and Kaletra, respectively. Since then, the government and drug
companies have continued negotiations. Abbott earlier this month offered
to sell Aluvia, an updated version of Kaletra, at a reduced price in
Thailand on the condition that the country agrees not to allow generic
versions of the drug into the market, Siriwat Thiptaradol,
secretary-general of Thailand's Food and Drug Administration, said.
Abbott offered to sell Aluvia for about 34,000 baht, or $1,000, per
person annually. Indian generic drug maker Matrix Laboratories has
offered to sell a generic version of Aluvia to Thailand for 24,324 baht,
or $695, per person annually. Siriwat said that the offer would be
considered by Mongkol. Under the terms of the offer, Thailand would have
to agree not to seek compulsory licensing for Aluvia and the price of
Aluvia could not be reduced any further (Kaiser Daily HIV/AIDS Report,
5/16).

After meeting with U.S. Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez, Mongkol
said that it is "clear" Gutierrez "represents the drug companies."
During the meeting, Gutierrez said it is not the responsibility of
pharmaceutical companies to absorb the burden of Thailand's health care
system, the Post reports. Sens. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) and Frank
Lautenberg (D-N.J.) responded similarly when discussing the issue with
Mongkol, according to the Post. Talks with Deputy U.S. Trade
Representative John Veroneau were more positive, the Post reports.
According to Vichai Chokewiwat, chair of the Government Pharmaceutical
Organization Board, Veroneau said that he understands the reasons behind
issuing the compulsory licenses, adding that they are "very reasonable."

Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) also was supportive of Thailand's actions,
according to the Post. "Thailand is an important U.S. ally that is
trying to save the lives of its citizens," Waxman said in a statement.
He added, "Accordingly, the U.S. should show compassion and provide
support to our longtime friend rather than impose punitive actions" --
such as the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative's recent
announcement that the country has been put on its Priority Watch List.
According to Vichai, the Thai government will continue with its plans
for compulsory licenses (Bangkok Post, 5/23).

Thailand Considers Revoking Compulsory License for Efavirenz

The Thai government is considering revoking its compulsory license for
Efavirenz following recent talks with Merck, Mongkol said on Wednesday.
According to Mongkol, Merck representatives have proposed several
options for pricing of the drug that could benefit both sides. Mongkol
did not give details about the options but said that they could serve as
examples for other pharmaceutical companies whose patents have been
overridden (Apiradee, Bangkok Post, 5/24).

PhRMA CEO Meets With Mongkol To Discuss Compulsory Licenses

In related news, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of
America might call on the Bush administration to take increased action
against Thailand if the country continues to issue compulsory licenses,
PhRMA CEO Bill Tauzin said recently, The Hill reports. According to The
Hill, Tauzin and Mongkol met on Tuesday to discuss the compulsory
licenses. Tauzin said that his meeting with Mongkol was open and
beneficial and that Mongkol emphasized Thailand sees the issuing of the
compulsory licenses as rare, The Hill reports.

According to Tauzin, PhRMA hopes that Thailand will consult with U.S.
pharmaceutical companies to lower drug costs without having to issue
compulsory licenses. He added that if Thailand continues to issue
compulsory licenses for drugs protected by patents, the group will
advocate for penalties, including those that could eliminate trade
preferences allowing some Thai imports to enter the U.S. duty free
(Swanson, The Hill, 5/23). "We can and will continue to have discussions
with our own government and officials around the world to promote
intellectual property protection," Tauzin said (Pierce, United Press
International, 5/23).

NPR's "Morning Edition" on Monday reported on efforts by Brazil and
Thailand to purchase generic versions of antiretrovirals. The segment
includes comments from Mongkol; Antonio Patriota, Brazil's ambassador to
the U.S.; Tauzin; and Jeffrey Sturchio, vice president for corporate
responsibility at Merck (Wilson, "Morning Edition," NPR, 5/21). Audio of
the segment is available online.
