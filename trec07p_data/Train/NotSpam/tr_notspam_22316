1) commit
2) push commits to a different server.

  What's to forget?

  If you still want to send patches, use a "trunk" and a "branch".  Then
create the patch by diff'ing the two.

  Someone has to pull the changes from one branch to another.  If the
changes don't merge cleanly, they are edited, committed, and then pushed.

  In git/mercurial, each checkout *is* a tree.  All commits are local,
so there's no problem.  Then, commits are pushed to a central tree.
That tree can have multiple people pushing to it.

  I've used mercurial in a number of projects.  It's much better than
anything else I've used, and the repositories are smaller than git,
too!.  It's simple, easy to use, and the tool just doesn't get in the way.

  "very well" is my experience.

  If N people are working on a project, it's usually useful to set up a
central repository for them, separate from the main tree.  That way they
can commit to their local trees, and they still have a central point of
coordination.  This subgroup tree can also have a copy of the main
trunk, so that merges from trunk to development branch happen only once.

  Then, when development finishes, you can push the changes or a patch
back to the main trunk, knowing that you're in sync, and that everything
works.
