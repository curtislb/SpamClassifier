Thank you for your kind reply !

Perl 6 is not yet finished, so the the list of core modules is not yet
specified.


I know that it is somehow not the subject,
but I think the actual 5.8 doc should be changed to some extents.
It could be nice if we could browse each core functions,
having the function parameters, flags (not that much used right?), and
the return value of the function, followed by exampleS
AND so that it could be a lot richer, allow people to "comment"...
I know this is not the point but it could be nice to do so for perl6 !
(I was thinking to create a kind of site like that for the actual perl,
but my programming competences are,well... )

Perl 6 does. See for example ext/Set/ in the pugs repository.


Glad to hear that !


You could help by contributing some suggestions to what the new "Web"
module should be able to do, and how so. Web is hopefully "CGI done
right", and still in its early planning stage.


Web module is a good name.

Is there a place where we can add suggestions ? apart from the first one in...
2003 ? 4 years ago ?
