						<div class=3D"GreyHeading">INSIDE SPORT PRESENTER GABBY LOGAN</div>
						<div>Hello, Gabby here.
<br>

<br>
This week - is the relegation battle over or is the Premier League about to=
 be taken to court?=20=20
<br>

<br>
A growing number of clubs are unhappy about the way the Premier League deal=
t with the controversial transfer of Javier Mascherano and Carlos Tevez.=20
<br>

<br>
They believe West Ham should have been docked points and want proof that Te=
vez was eligible to play.=20=20
<br>

<br>
We'll be asking a top sports lawyer if results on the pitch could be overtu=
rned by verdicts in court.
<br>

<br>
And let me introduce you to the world of top England batsman, Kevin Pieters=
en.=20=20
<br>

<br>
Gone are the blonde highlights and late nights.=20=20
<br>

<br>
He is, as they say, a changed man.=20=20
<br>

<br>
My interview with him is a fascinating watch.=20
<br>

<br>
And we visit Los Angeles - the city is in a state of fevered expectation as=
 the weeks tick away to the arrival of David Beckham.=20=20
<br>

<br>
LA Galaxy say they've already made a lot of their money back - given Becks =
got a =C2=A3125m deal, they need to really - but we found he might have a p=
retty hard time winning over the baseball and basketball fans.
<br>

<br>
All that AND the results of our competition to win a pair of tickets to Sat=
urday's FA Cup final.
<br>

<br>
Don't miss it - tonight , BBC ONE, five past eleven.
<br>

<br>
<b>Gabby hosts Inside Sport on Monday 14 May, 2305 BST on BBC ONE, and seco=
nd edition, Sunday 20 May, 1130 BST on BBC TWO. </b></div></td>
