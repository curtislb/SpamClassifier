The way I see it, each GCompris activity will provide it's own control bar so
it's not necessary to have it at Sugar level.

To explain it better, Sugar will let you run each individual GCompris activity,
and thus it replaces our internal menu.

Some news on our side, we are moving slowly but surely to an architecture that
suits the Sugar environment. Our latest trunk no more use SDL_Mixer but use
gstreamer instead for the audio backend and we integrated the gnomecanvas as a
static library to remove the dependancy burden.

We have created a gcomprixo branch in our svn to continue the modification
towards a Sugar friendly GCompris. Yesterday, we integrated the Sven's libccc
canvas library based on cairo. We plan to use it to move to the cairo path.

Bruno.
