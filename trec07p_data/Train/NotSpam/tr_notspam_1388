So have you really read (and tried to understand) the 
"Introduction to R"  that's web- available and comes built 
into R?

Well it means that "for your version of R" there is no package
called 'gam' available, i.e. "what it says"

or do you expect software to tell you something about the world at
large, namely that there is no R package named 'gam' on the
whole wide world ?  :-) 


[ BTW, for using a more modern version of gam(),
  there's the recommended package 'mgcv' - which you don't have
  to install :

  library(mgcv)
  help(gam)

  ....
]

    Thomas> The R software has much gold in it, but, as far as

Well it is recommended that you learn it from a human rather
than from "itself".  One way to learn from humans is by reading
books, manuals, ....
and for R, there are quite a few, both freely available with R
and on the web, and others "in a bookstore near you" ...
A more comfortable way for some is to attend a course / class...

I hope you can bear the somewhat flippy tone of my answer,...
I'm just trying to counter your own humorous one ;-) :-)

Martin
