Lou Dobbs Tonight
Wednesday, April 18, 2007

Tonight, the deadliest wave of attacks in Iraq since the troop
build-up began in the capital. At the same time, a top CENTCOM
commander says we’re losing ground in Iraq every day. We’ll
have the latest on the fatal attacks that killed nearly 200
people today.

We’ll also continue our coverage of the horrible Virginia Tech
rampage. The massacre at Virginia Tech this week has sparked
renewed controversy about gun control laws in America. In our
special report tonight, we'll discuss the Second Amendment and
why so many are now calling for changes.

Lou’s out with a new commentary today on why we must reject
death and violence as a rite of passage on college campuses:
While the horror of the murders in Blacksburg galvanizes our
attention, we’re permitting the violent deaths of thousands of
college students as a result of drug overdoses,
drinking-related accidents and suicides. Why?

Visit http://cnn.com/loudobbstonight to read Lou’s
thoughts, as well as for more on tonight’s show.

During a hearing on Capitol Hill today, the Senate Commerce
Committee posed the question: “Is ‘Free Trade’ Working?” This
comes just ahead of a vote to extend President Bush's
fast-track trade authority. Many say it’s time to put that
power back in the hands of our lawmakers. We'll have that
report tonight.

The Bush administration is apparently falling behind in its
goal to hire Border Patrol agents to replace National Guard
troops on the U.S.–Mexico border. A new report found the
government has hired only 593 of the 6,000 Border Patrol agents
it wants to place on the border by the end of next year.
Meanwhile, National Guard units are putting plans in place to
begin reducing the number of troops on the border. Will the
government find enough qualified people to hire?

Lou Dobbs lays out his manifesto to save the middle class in
his new book, “War on the Middle Class: How the Government, Big
Business, and Special Interest Groups Are Waging War on the
American Dream and How to Fight Back.” War on the Middle Class
is now on sale in bookstores near you and on Amazon.com and
BarnesandNoble.com.
