Here are some examples of the type of data crunching you might have to do.

In response to the requests by Christophe Pallier and Martin Stevens.

Before I started developing Vilno, some six years ago, I had been working in
the pharmaceuticals for eight years ( it's not easy to show you actual data
though, because it's all confidential of course).

Lab data can be especially messy, especially if one clinical trial allows
the physicians to use different labs. So let's consider lab data.

Merge in normal ranges, into the lab data. This has to be done by lab-site
and lab testcode(PLT for platelets, etc.), obviously. I've seen cases where
you also need to match by sex and age. The sex column in the normal ranges
could be: blank, F, M, or B ( B meaning for Both sexes). The age column in
the normal ranges could be: blank, or something like "40 <55". Even worse,
you could have an ageunits column in the normal ranges dataset: usually "Y",
but if there are children in the clinical trial, you will have "D" or "M",
for Days and Months. If the clinical trial is for adults, all rows with "D"
or "M" should be tossed out at the start. Clearly the statistical programmer
has to spend time looking at the data, before writing the program. Remember,
all of these details can change any time you move to a new clinical trial.

So for the lab data, you have to merge in the patient's date of birth,
calculate age, and somehow relate that to the age-group column in the normal
ranges dataset.

(By the way, in clinical trial data preparation, the SAS datastep is much
more useful and convenient, in my opinion, than the SQL SELECT syntax, at
least 97% of the time. But in the middle of this program, when you merge the
normal ranges into the lab data, you get a better solution with PROC SQL (
just the SQL SELECT statement implemented inside SAS) This is because of the
trickiness of the age match-up, and the SAS datastep does not do well with
many-to-many joins.).

Merge in various study drug administration dates into the lab data. Now, for
each lab record, calculate treatment period ( or cycle number ), depending
on the statistician's specifications and the way the clinical trial is
structured.

Different clinical sites chose to use different lab providers. So, for
example, for Monocytes, you have 10 different units ( essentially 6 units,
but spelling inconsistencies as well). The statistician has requested that
you use standardized units in some of the listings ( % units, and only one
type of non-% unit, for example ). At the same time, lab values need to be
converted ( *1.61 , divide by 1000, etc. ). This can be very time consuming
no matter what software you use, and, in my experience, when the SAS
programmer asks for more clinical information or lab guidebooks, the
response is incomplete, so he does a lot of guesswork. SAS programmers do
not have expertise in lab science, hence the guesswork.

Your program has to accomodate numeric values, "1.54" , quasi-numeric values
"<1" , and non-numeric values "Trace".

Your data listing is tight for space, so print "PROLONGED CELL CONT" as
"PRCC".

Once normal ranges are merged in, figure out which values are out-of-range
and high , which are low, and which are within normal range. In the data
listing, you may have "H" or "L" appended to the result value being printed.

For each treatment period, you may need a unique lab record selected, in
case there are two or three for the same treatment period. The statistician
will tell the SAS programmer how. Maybe the averages of the results for that
treatment period, maybe that lab record closest to the mid-point of of the
treatment period. This isn't for the data listing, but for a summary table.

For the differentials ( monocytes, lymphocytes, etc) , merge in the WBC
(total white blood cell count) values , to convert values between % units
and absolute count units.

When printing the values in the data listing, you need "H" or "L" to the
right of the value. But you also need the values to be well lined up ( the
decimal place ). This can be stupidly time consuming.



AND ON AND ON AND ON .....

I think you see why clinical trials statisticians and SAS programmers enjoy
lots of job security.
