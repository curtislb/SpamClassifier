</tbody>
</table><font class="storytext">

<strong>Queen Elizabeth II</strong> and <strong>Prince Philip</strong> must have been a little disappointed last night. The White House dinner thrown in their honor didn't include any Hollywood stars. Remember when <strong>Princess Diana</strong> got fussed over by <strong>John Travolta</strong> and <strong>Tom Selleck</strong>? How times have changed! 

</font></p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Instead, the guest list was a strange mix of media people and <strong>Bush</strong>/Republican high rollers. Among the latter: Texan <strong>Harold Simmons</strong>, who has given Republican candidates $370,000 over the last decade, according to published records.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Another Texas billionaire, <strong>Richard Kinder</strong>, formerly of Enron, donor of nearly $750,000 to Republicans over the last dozen years, also made the cut.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">So did <strong>Jerry Perenchio</strong> of Chartwell Partners, whose family in total has impressively given about $1.6 million to Republican causes over the same period — and a few thousand to Democrats, just in case.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext"><strong>T. Boone Pickens</strong> ($322,851 on his own) was there too, as was <strong>Gerry Shaheen</strong>, president of Caterpillar Group ($370,000) and <strong>Herbert Kohler</strong>, who has opened his fancy faucets for Republicans to the tune of $257,993.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Actual celebrities? You tell me. Among the attendees were NBC's <strong>David Gregory</strong>, ABC's <strong>Robin Roberts</strong>, pregnant member of "The View" <strong>Elisabeth Hasselbeck</strong>, her football player husband <strong>Tim</strong>, plus <strong>Peyton Manning</strong>, <strong>Arnold Palmer</strong>, <strong>Henry Kissinger</strong>, the wife of opera star <strong>Placido Domingo</strong> and violinist <strong>Itzhak Perlman</strong>.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Queen Elizabeth II may have returned home with a T-shirt that read: "I went to the White House and all I got was this lousy T-shirt and anecdotes about <strong>Rosie O'Donnell</strong>."</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Of course, most Hollywood stars probably identify themselves as Democrats, but still: Who would turn down an invitation to meet the Queen of England at the White House?</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">At <strong>Liz Smith</strong>'s Literacy Partners dinner last night in New York, <strong>Bette Midler</strong> — the surprise performer at the swellicious Lincoln Center event — quipped about the State dinner, "I wasn't invited, so it turned out I was free. And I hear <strong>President Bush</strong> has already made his first faux pas of the night. He congratulated Queen Elizabeth on her Oscar win."</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext"><a id="2" name="2"><font class="fox411hed">Liz Smith Dishes Up $20 Million</font></a></p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">And yes, the Literacy Partners event last night at Lincoln Center's New York State Theater was a tribute to the amazing <strong>Liz Smith</strong> and her partners-in-reading <strong>Arnold Scaasi</strong> and <strong>Parker Ladd</strong>.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">They have raised more than $20 million in 20 years to teach illiterate adults how to read. Last night they raised $1.2 million with special guests <strong>Vanessa Redgrave</strong>, <strong>Frank Langella</strong> and novelist <strong>Alexander McCall Smith</strong> giving readings.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Literacy Partners is a phenomenon. With low overhead, the smallish group spent $1.6 million last year, according to tax records, just on programs. The staff gets reasonable, not particularly great, salaries, but the results are huge.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Two graduates of the program spoke last night and, as usual, brought tears to the eyes of the most jaded New Yorkers. They were a 46-year-old man and a 36-year-old woman whose lives have changed thanks to Literacy Partners. Remarkable.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Among the guests: Hearst Magazines' <strong>Cathie Black</strong> and <strong>Ellen Levine</strong> — Hearst was the night's sponsor. <strong>Harry Evans</strong> and <strong>Tina Brown</strong> broke bread with many members of the New York glitterati, including the quite legendary artist <strong>Francoise Gilot</strong>, who is also the mother of <strong>Paloma</strong> and <strong>Claude Picasso</strong>; and ABC News' <strong>Cynthia McFadden</strong>, who brought with her <strong>Bob Woodruff</strong> and his wife, <strong>Lee</strong>. The latter pair read a little from their new book and spoke about their ordeal since Woodruff was wounded a year ago in Iraq. Again, remarkable. They are a great team.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Scaasi and Ladd have worked hard on Literacy Partners all these years, but Liz Smith is really the face of the organization. How she has time for it, I don't know.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">At 80-plus years old, she is still turning out a great daily gossip column in the New York Post and online. It's the template for this column — don't kid yourselves. We've learned more from Liz than from three major colleges.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">She is the gold standard for entertainment reporting, and the gold standard period. Bravo!</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext"><a id="3" name="3"><font class="fox411hed">'Spider-Man 3' Makes More Than Anticipated</font></a></p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">"Spider-Man 3" actually took in just over $151 million over the weekend in the U.S. alone. That's about $3 million more than Sony originally thought. Whew!</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">The total take for the whole wide world in just three days: $381,660,892. Think about it: They don't even need to take out another ad. Sony's work is done. Everything from here on out is gravy.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Of course, hitting the $1 billion mark wouldn't be bad, either. And it's possible. Let's face it: We're stuck with Spidey for a decade more at least.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext"><strong>Drew Barrymore</strong>'s "luck" has run out; "Lucky You" is a huge dud. Barrymore may be People's Most Beautiful girl, but she's made one too many versions of the same romantic comedy. This one was the straw that, you know ...</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Luckily, Drew is supposed to take on more serious fare next; a dramatization of the <strong>Al Maysles</strong>' documentary "Grey Gardens."</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Speaking of Maysles, his 27-years-in-the-making doc, "The Gates," about artists <strong>Christo</strong> and <strong>Jeanne-Claude</strong>'s efforts to set up a series of orange gates in Central Park, closed the Tribeca Film Festival.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Maysles started the film in 1979, when Christo and Jeanne-Claude were first turned down by the New York City Parks Department. It took them until 2005, when Mayor <strong>Mike Bloomberg</strong> quickly agreed and let them fulfill their dream.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">The film is a great historical document, particularly as it shows the short-sighted New Yorkers — politicians and civilians — who stupidly blocked the Gates back then.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">If they are alive, they will be embarrassed to see themselves on film now. Ah, bureaucracy: It's a four-letter word.</p>
