Perhaps I could explain what I meant to say better than that....  

Starting R with the --vanilla switch will load graphics and the
grDevices packages (among others).  There seems to be a difference
from previous versions if I use a ~/.Rprofile file to load the
graphics package, since the grDevices does NOT automatically load
whereas it did in R-2.4.x versions.  That might be a bug, but since
others don't seem to have the problem, I'd hesitate to say.  

In any case, if grDevices isn't in the search list, I'd be fairly
certain you can get round the problem you describe by specifically
loading it, or adding it to the startup list of packages.  (I'm
assuming you installed R from the tgz file and not an rpm).  I, too,
use Redhat/Fedora but other users don't seem to have the same problem,
so it's likely something more specific to our setups.

As ever, the more knowledgeable could have a better idea.
