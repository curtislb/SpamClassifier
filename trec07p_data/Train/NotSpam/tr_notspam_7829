Mannheimer Kunstdieb hat mit Bestnote promoviert
 
Sein "emotionales Verh?ltnis zu Spitzweg" wird Rechtsanwalt zum Verh?ngnis -
Von Ehefrau der Vergewaltigung bezichtigt
 
MANNHEIM. Der Diebstahl des Gem?ldes "Friedenszeit" von Carl Spitzweg bei
der Langen Nacht der Museen hat die Mannheimer Kunsthalle vergangenes Jahr
ersch?ttert. Seit gestern steht der mutma?liche T?ter vor Gericht. Er ist
ein Jurist mit Doktortitel.

Von Johanna Eberhardt

Mit dem Diebstahl des Spitzwegbilds hat der 41-j?hrige Jurist vor einem Jahr
bundesweit Schlagzeilen gemacht und die Verantwortlichen der angesehenen
Mannheimer Kunsthalle ziemlich blamiert. Die Sicherheitslage in dem Museum
sei zum Zeitpunkt der Tat mehr als nur katastrophal gewesen, meinte der
Verteidiger des Angeklagten zum Prozessauftakt. "F?r diese Bilder hat es gar
keine Sicherheit gegeben. Sie standen einfach so in einem abgedunkelten
Raum, ohne Bewacher, gleich neben dem Hintereingang. Wenn man an dem Abend
mit einem Lastwagen vorgefahren w?re, h?tte man noch viel mehr mitnehmen
k?nnen."

Dem Angeklagten d?rfte das nicht allzu viel helfen. Denn er muss sich nicht
nur wegen des gestohlenen Spitzwegs verantworten. Nach seiner Festnahme im
Dezember vergangenen Jahres hatte ihn seine Ehefrau auch noch der
Vergewaltigung, der N?tigung und der K?rperverletzung bezichtigt. Vier F?lle
hat die Staatsanw?ltin aufgelistet. Sollten sich die Vorw?rfe als richtig
erweisen, k?nnten sie am Ende strafrechtlich schwerer wiegen als der
spektakul?re Kunstdiebstahl.

Den hat der Angeklagte gestern - wie zuvor schon im Verlauf der Ermittlungen
- einger?umt, ebenso zwei kleinere ?bergriffe auf seine Frau. Die
Vergewaltigungen hat er hingegen bestritten. Die Ehe seines Mandanten, sagte
sein Verteidiger, sei bereits kurz nach der Hochzeit gescheitert. Dessen
ungeachtet hatte sich das Paar am 18. M?rz 2006 gemeinsam aufgemacht, um die
Lange Nacht der Museen im Rhein-Neckar-Dreieck zu erleben. Nach der
Sportschau zogen beide los: zun?chst ins Hack-Museum nach Ludwigshafen,
anschlie?end ins Mannheimer Schloss, die Jesuitenkirche, die
Reiss-Engelhorn-Museen und eine Galerie am Wasserturm, berichtete der
Verteidiger. Dabei habe sein Mandant, ein Kunstliebhaber, "Wei?wein in nicht
unerheblichen Mengen" getrunken.

Gegen Mitternacht seien beide in die Kunsthalle gegangen, wo der Angeklagte
seiner Frau einige seiner Lieblingsbilder haben zeigen wollen. Beide h?tten
zun?chst eine Weile einem K?nstler zugeschaut, der erotische Bilder gemalt
habe; sein Mandant h?tte gern eines der Werke gekauft, doch der Maler habe
in der Museumsnacht nicht verkaufen wollen. So seien beide weitergegangen in
den abgedunkelten Altbau der Kunsthalle, wo sich auch das ber?hmte Gem?lde
Eduard Manets von der Erschie?ung Kaiser Maximilians befindet.

Zum Erstaunen seines Mandanten sei der fragliche Raum offen gewesen; zwar
h?tten keine Bilder an den W?nden gehangen, daf?r sei alles, was Rang und
Wert hatte, auf dem Boden gestanden. So habe er sich entschieden, f?r seine
Frau "eine Privatf?hrung zu veranstalten". Der Spitzweg "Friedenszeit" -
eines von zwei Bildern des Malers, habe ihr "ausnehmend gut gefallen". Da
habe er, halb im Scherz, halb im Ernst, gesagt, das mache er jetzt ihr und
sich zum Geschenk. Er habe das Bild aus dem Rahmen gel?st, an sich genommen
und die Frau aufgefordert, zu sehen ob "die Luft rein ist". Dann h?tten sie
das Museum getrennt verlassen. "Vor dem Wasserturm haben sie sich wieder
getroffen und gewundert, wie leicht alles war", schilderte der Anwalt.
Anfangs habe sein Mandant erwogen, das Bild rasch wieder zur?ckzubringen.
Doch dann habe er sich entschieden, es in einem Schlie?fach im Bahnhof zu
deponieren. Sp?ter habe er es sicher verpackt in einem Koffer zun?chst bei
einem Freund in Pforzheim, dann bei einem anderen in Bruchsal untergebracht.
Es sei, sagte er denen, Schmuddelkram drin.

Die tieferen Motive der Tat blieben am ersten Verhandlungstag unklar. Der
Angeklagte, im dunklen Anzug, wei?en Hemd, goldfarbener Krawatte, sagte dazu
nichts und lie? auch sonst lieber seinen Verteidiger sprechen. Zu Spitzweg,
meinte der, habe sein Mandant "seit Kindertagen ein geradezu emotionales
Verh?ltnis gehabt".

Sicher kann man davon ausgehen, dass der Angeklagte wusste, was er tat: Nach
Angaben seines Anwalt hat der 41-J?hrige nach dem Abitur in Bruchsal und dem
Milit?rdienst bei den Fallschirmj?gern Jura in Heidelberg studiert. Er war
zun?chst dort als wissenschaftlicher Assistent t?tig, danach promovierte er
in Wien ?ber das Thema "Der Kunsthandel unter besonderer Ber?cksichtigung
des internationalen Rechts" und schloss mit der Bestnote ab. Anschlie?end
lie? er sich erst in Heidelberg, dann in Mannheim als Rechtsanwalt nieder.

Seine Karriere neigte sich dem Ende zu, als einige Monate nach dem Diebstahl
ein Informant die Polizei wissen lie?, dass der Jurist einen Spitzweg zum
Verkauf anbiete. Im ber?hmten Caf? Flo in Mannheim nahm ein verdeckter
Ermittler des Landeskriminalamts im Oktober 2006 den ersten Kontakt zu ihm
auf. Im Dezember, bei der Besichtigung des Bildes, wurde er festgenommen und
sitzt seither in Untersuchungshaft. Er hatte eine Million Euro f?r das Bild
verlangt, das 500 000 Euro Wert ist. Seine Anwaltszulassung hat er
zur?ckgegeben.

Library to be repaired
By Kristen Chick
THE WASHINGTON TIMES
Published May 3, 2007
 
D.C. officials will spend $15 million to $20 million to repair the
Georgetown public library damaged this week in a three-alarm fire, D.C.
Mayor Adrian M. Fenty said yesterday. 
    Mr. Fenty has identified $7.2 million in capital funds for the repair
project, which library officials said will take years to complete. 
    "The administration's No. 1 point here is that we are committed to
rebuilding Georgetown's historic library 100 percent," the mayor said in a
press conference in front of the building, in the 3000 block of R Street
Northwest. 
    The fire started about 12:30 p.m. Monday. 
    An electrical short sparked another fire that day, at 1 a.m. at the
Eastern Market in the Capitol Hill neighborhood. Damage to the market is
estimated at $5 million to $10 million. 
    Mr. Fenty, a Democrat, said Tuesday that the administration will use
"supplemental revenue" to assist vendors and to rebuild the market, in the
200 block of Seventh Street Southeast. He said the city's chief financial
officer, Natwar M. Ghandi, will identify the revenue next week. 
    The D.C. Sports and Entertainment Commission will consider opening the
D.C. Armory as a temporary site for displaced Eastern Market vendors. 
    Officials said the armory could not accommodate vendors this month
because of scheduled events, but it may be available during the summer. 
    "If there's some way we can be a good neighbor, we'd like to be if we
can," said Allen Lew, chief executive of the sports commission. 
    Neither the library nor the market had a sprinkler system and neither
was required to have one. 
    A bookmobile will be dispatched to the library by next week, and a
location for a temporary library is being sought, said Ginnie Cooper, chief
librarian for the D.C. Public Library System. 
    A fire station in Georgetown will serve as a temporary reading room for
children until the library is restored, said fire Chief Dennis L. Rubin. 
    The children's room and story time were two of the library's most
popular attractions, residents said. 
    The room was among the worst damaged in the fire, which started in the
attic and destroyed most of the roof. 
    With the ceiling collapsed, the room is open to the elements. Steel
beams lie with scorched children's books scattered in the rubble. 
    Fire department spokesman Alan Etter said the blaze was not set
deliberately, but officials are investigating. One suspected cause is
renovation work being performed on the building's trim and windows. 
    Mr. Etter said construction workers may have tried to extinguish the
fire. Chief Rubin said the workers did not call the fire department
immediately after the blaze started. 
    The lapse contributed to the extent of the destruction more than the two
malfunctioning fire hydrants closest to the building, he said. 
    Georgetown residents who gathered for the mayor's address and library
tour expressed relief that most of the historical documents and paintings in
the library's Peabody Room had survived the fire. 
    The Peabody Room, on the second floor, was wet but intact. The glass
cases that lined the walls were empty, the pieces of history they had housed
stored safely in a freezer truck to be taken to a restoration facility.

His mission -- to save art looted by Nazis. Here's how he did it.
Jesse Hamlin, Chronicle Staff Writer

Friday, May 4, 2007

Bernard Taper dreamed about Raphael's "Portrait of a Young Man,'' the most
prized painting looted by the Nazis that has never been found. He spent two
years searching for the Raphael in ravaged post-World War II Germany -- and
for many other works he did recover -- as an art-intelligence officer with
the Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives section of the U.S. military. 

"It's the most valuable single thing that's still missing,'' says Taper, a
longtime writer for the New Yorker, one-time Chronicle reporter and retired
UC Berkeley journalism professor. He tracked down many artworks in 1946 and
'47, including objects German peasants had looted from an abandoned train
carrying booty pilfered by Luftwaffe chief Hermann G?ring. A connoisseur of
luxury, G?ring had amassed thousands of paintings, sculptures and others
works during his tenure as the second-most powerful man in Nazi Germany. 

Taper is sitting in the sunny living room of the Berkeley home he shares
with his wife, poet Gwen Head, recalling the slippery art advisers, black
marketeers and such top Nazis as Albert Speer he interrogated 60 years ago.
On the table is a book published by the Polish government, in English titled
"Wartime Losses, Foreign Paintings, Volume I,'' with Raphael's curly-haired
young man on the cover (the portrait belonged to the Czartoryski Museum in
Krakow). He's become the poster child for the countless artworks stolen by
Hitler and his Nazi henchmen from Jewish homes and art galleries, civic
museums, private collections and churches across Europe -- tens of thousands
of them still missing -- during the reign of the Third Reich. 

"The Nazis were not just the most systematic mass murderers in history, they
were the greatest thieves,'' says historian Jonathan Petropoulos in the
potent new documentary "The Rape of Europa,'' which screens at the San
Francisco International Film Festival next Monday, Tuesday and Thursday and
plays at the Krakow and Jerusalem film festivals next month. Taper is one of
several of the so-called Monument Men who appear in the film. They describe
the vast hordes of art, furniture and religious objects the Nazis stashed in
castles, salt mines and bunkers in Germany and Austria, and the noble
efforts to recover, protect and return them to the countries from which they
were stolen. 

Jointly written, produced and directed by three San Francisco filmmakers --
Richard Berge, Bonni Cohen and Nicole Newnham -- "The Rape of Europa'' is
based on the 1995 book of the same name by Lynn Nicholas. Seven years in the
making, the documentary delves into the Nazis' obsession with art, and the
fervor for not only wiping out entire races but also their cultural
patrimony as well. And it tells the story of the people who tried to salvage
the remnants of European culture and those still working to repair the
damage: the Monument Men on the front lines in Italy who sought to protect
historic buildings and artworks from Allied bombing (sometimes
unsuccessfully); the working people at the Louvre in Paris and the Hermitage
in St. Petersburg, who struggled to save their cultural heritage; and the
Italian conservators still piecing together the shattered frescoes from the
Camposanto in Pisa, destroyed by Allied shells. 

"I was fascinated with this issue of art and culture being like mana,
invested with some kind of soul,'' says Berge, who met his co-directors in
the early '90s in the documentary film masters' program at Stanford. "The
Nazis wanted to eliminate it, and all these other people wanted to protect
it. You could kill all the people, but if the objects remained, there would
be something left of the soul. And the Nazis were trying to eliminate every
vestige of it.'' 

Rather than dealing in obvious terms of good and evil, Cohen says, "it was
central for us to get all those gray areas. We wanted to get into the
mind-set, to understand the Nazis' obsessive art collecting -- not only the
collecting but the eradication -- and what it said about them. We felt
strongly that this was a new lens to look at this period of history through,
and we could bear witness in a different way than how we were taught about
the Holocaust.'' 

A failed artist, Hitler had begun collecting art and using it as propaganda
after his rise to power in the 1930s. He had more than 16,000 works of
modern art, which he labeled "degenerate,'' purged from German museums. They
were destroyed, sold or traded for Old Masters. Other high-ranking Nazis
began collecting, following the example of the F?hrer, who planned a great
museum of European art, honoring his reign, in his provincial hometown of
Linz, Austria. Many of the stolen Rembrandts, Vermeers and Boticellis were
earmarked for Hitler's museum. 

When American art experts learned of the Nazi looting, they convinced
President Franklin D. Roosevelt to form a commission to try to save European
monuments and artworks as the Allies prepared to invade Europe. Officers
with art and curatorial backgrounds were assigned to Army units to advise
the advancing troops about what buildings were worth saving. They made
aerial photographs marking monuments not to be bombed. A strategic bombing
of the vital Florence rail yards spared the city's great art treasures, but
the Germans blew up historic bridges as they retreated. 

The ranks of the Monument Men included such later well-known figures as
James Rorimer, future director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and
Lincoln Kirsten, director of the New York City Ballet (Taper wrote the
definitive biography of the great Russian-born choreographer Kirsten brought
to America, George Balanchine). One of the most lauded Monument Men was
Capt. Deane Keller, a Yale art professor charged with protecting Italian art
and buildings. A medieval cemetery with vast Gothic galleries containing
treasured frescoes, the Camposanto was accidentally hit during the battle
for Pisa, and the lead roof melted over the frescoes and marble work. 

Over the next several weeks, Keller got Italian soldiers to clean the place
out and pick up thousands of fresco fragments. He got U.S. Army engineers to
build a temporary roof to shield works that survived, hunting up the
materials wherever he could, and sent art conservators from Rome and
Florence to tend to the works. Keller, who later rescued a horde of looted
works by Michelangelo, Botticelli and Raphael and accompanied their
triumphant return to Florence, was buried in Camposanto after his death in
1992. 

"My story is not as heroic or as glamorous as those of the earlier Monuments
people, whom I look on as legendary figures, truly chivalric in their
courage, enterprise and dedication to a cause,'' Taper wrote in a 1995
essay, included in a book "The Spoils of War,'' the title of an
international symposium he participated in that year. 

"I was in the Army for three years, and I didn't fire a shot at anybody and
nobody fired a shot at me. That's the definition of a good war,'' the
white-haired Taper, sharp at 89, says with a smile. But he did his part to
bring forth light, in the form of recovered art, from the darkness of the
war. 

Born in London and educated at UC Berkeley, Taper was drafted into the U.S.
Army in 1943. He served in intelligence and infantry units before being sent
back to Berkeley to learn Chinese in preparation for work as a liaison
officer assigned to Chaing Kai-Shek's army in China. But at the last minute,
the entire class was sent to Germany, where the war was over. 

"It was the Army. Why do you think they invented words like 'snafu'?" laughs
Taper, who was assigned to Patton's Third Army, then sent to Munich to write
intelligence reports. Lunching outdoors one day at an officers' club, he
fell into conversation with a dashing chap named Walter Horn, an Aryan
German who abhorred Hitler and left, became a professor of medieval history
at UC Berkeley and saw combat action during the war. 

"He started telling me marvelous, fascinating stories about what it was like
in his job to search for lost and stolen art,'' recalls Taper, who had begun
contributing to the New Yorker and the Nation while serving in occupied
Germany. Horn was desperate to go home, but couldn't until he found a
successor for his art-investigating job. "When he met me he found his
successor,'' says Taper, who told Horn he wasn't an art historian and
probably wasn't qualified. Horn said the Monuments section was "lousy with
art historians,'' but what was needed was somebody who knew how to ask
questions. As a budding journalist, Taper fit the bill. 

As a further inducement, Horn told him he would have the use of a white BMW
roadster, wouldn't have to wear a uniform, could travel freely without
orders and would meet women. "And he said if nothing else, there's all this
art you can look at,'' recalls Taper, quick to point out that he got a brown
Audi sedan, not the promised BMW. For about six weeks, Taper was in charge
of the Army's art-collecting center at Wiesbaden, which was filled with not
only looted art but works from various German civic collections. 

"They had fantastic stuff there,'' Taper says. "In the office, across the
whole back wall, was Watteau's 'Embarkation for Cythera,' and a wonderful
Degas, where you look up through the orchestra pit, through the beards of
the musicians, at these elegant dancers. It was from the Frankfurt Museum.''
As Taper says in the documentary, "Just that office alone was worth the
price of admission to World War II.'' Outside the door stood a
5,000-year-old stone Nefertiti, which also stopped Taper in his tracks. "I
couldn't just brush by. I had to stop and commune with her.'' 

Building on the work of previous Monument Men, such as his friend Stewart
Leonard, a bomb diffuser who single-handedly removed 22 mines from the
Chartres Cathedral and later opened crates containing priceless books and
D?rer drawings, Taper tracked down mostly mid-level missing artworks, by
painters like the 16th century Dutch artist Mierevelt and his Flemish
contemporary Teniers, as well church statuary and other looted objects. 

"Probably the best artwork I helped recover was from G?ring's train,'' Taper
says, abandoned on a rail siding not far from Neuschwanstein Castle, where
Allied troops found a huge cache of stolen art. The locals had heard there
was schnapps on board, Taper says, and after stealing the schnapps, they
took the rest of the stuff, which included late-Gothic wood statutes and a
15th century School of Rogier van der Weyden painting. "Not bad,'' says
Taper, who had the bright idea of tapping the de-Nazifed German police to
help him find stolen goods. 

He learned that the Gothic statutes had been taken by a cabinetmaker named
Roth. When caught, the man said he'd seen the objects lying in the mud and
"took pity on them'' by taking them home. "After that,'' Taper says, "when
we had an interrogation, we'd say, 'Did you steal that, or did you just take
pity on it?' " 

Searching for the missing Raphael, Taper questioned many people, including
the art advisers to Hans Frank, the Nazi governor of the occupied Polish
area called "General Gouvernement.'' Frank kept the Raphael, along with a
Rembrandt and Leonardo's "Lady with an Ermine'' -- both of which were found
and returned to the rightful owner -- in his Krakow residence. As the
Russians advanced on Krakow, Frank and his entourage left in a rush, taking
all three masterpieces with them. They stopped in various towns on their way
to Bavaria. By the time Frank was captured in Neuhaus, the Raphael had
vanished. 

Taper spent many hours questioning Frank's first art adviser, the
"infamous'' Kajetan M?hlmann and his successor, Wilhelm Ernest von
Palezieux, whom Taper found in the French occupation zone. He got
conflicting stories -- all of these characters suffered from what Taper
calls "selective amnesia'' -- tracked down all the leads, but came up
empty-handed. A number of important missing works have cropped up in recent
years as paintings have come on the market and governments open their files.
The Russians, who suffered mightily at Hitler's hands, still have loads of
things Stalin took from Germany when the Red Army got back what was left of
the stolen Russian art. Taper doesn't know if the Raphael will ever
resurface. 

In addition to returning looted works, "a major part of our task was the
fostering of the public German institutions,'' says Taper, who still recalls
concerts held in freezing halls in bombed-out cities across Germany, which
fed defeated spirits. "That was all they had.'' 

Taper thinks the work the Monument Men did was not only important in terms
of equity, but also as ritual and symbol. "It was a symbol that there were
higher values than victory, higher values than patriotism,'' he says. "It
was a rare kind of behavior, which was a disinterested doing of good.'' 

In "The Rape of Europa,'' an Army doctor named Leonard Malamut, who was on
hand when American soldiers discovered Hitler's vast horde of loot a quarter
mile down a salt mine in the Austrian Alps, says: "All this accumulated
beauty had been stolen by the most murderous thieves that ever existed on
the face of the Earth. How they could retain the nicety of appreciation of
great art and be exterminating millions of people nearby in concentration
camps, I couldn't understand then and I can't understand it today.'' 

Taper may not understand, but he can fathom it. "Human beings are
complicated,'' he says. "I've read enough Shakespeare to know.'' 

Still, "amid all the sickening evidence of man's depravity and
destructiveness,'' he wrote, it was good to "help preserve some of the
things mankind had done that one could not only bear to contemplate but even
take joy in.'' 

"The Rape of Europa": The film that documents the work of Bernard Taper and
other Monument Men screens at the San Francisco International Film Festival.

Anwalt gesteht Spitzweg-Diebstahl 
500000-Euro-Gem?lde aus Mannheimer Kunsthalle entwendet/Prozess vor
Landgericht 

Vom 04.05.2007

MANNHEIM Ein Anwalt hat gestanden, ein Gem?lde des K?nstlers Carl Spitzweg
aus einem Mannheimer Museum gestohlen zu haben. Seit gestern muss sich der
41-J?hrige vor dem Landgericht verantworten. Der Jurist soll zudem seine
Frau vergewaltigt und misshandelt haben.

 
Von

Ulrich Willenberg

"Mein Mandant hat seit Kindertagen ein geradezu emotionales Verh?ltnis zu
Spitzweg-Gem?lden", berichtete dessen Verteidiger Hans Ulrich Beust. Der
Angeklagte hatte das Bild im M?rz 2006 w?hrend der "Langen Nacht der Museen"
aus der Kunsthalle entwendet. Neun Monate sp?ter versuchte er dieses f?r
eine Million Euro an einen verdeckten Ermittler der Polizei zu verkaufen.

Der Diebstahl sei ein "spontaner Entschluss" gewesen, lie? der Angeklagte
gestern seinen Verteidiger erkl?ren. Sein Mandant wollte sich und seiner
Frau "das Bild zum Geschenk machen", sagte Beust. Das Paar habe nach
zahlreichen Gl?sern Wein nachts die Kunsthalle besucht. Dort entdeckten
beide den kleinformatigen Spitzweg aus dem 19. Jahrhundert, der auch der
Frau gefiel. "Sie fand besonders den kleinen Vogel auf der Kanone niedlich",
so der Verteidiger. Das Biedermaier-Gem?lde mit dem Titel "Friedenszeit"
zeigt einen g?hnenden Wachtposten auf einer Bastei.

Auch in der Mannheimer Kunsthalle war man offenbar nicht besonders wachsam.
So stand das Gem?lde in einem nicht abgeschlossenen Nebenraum, zu dem das
Publikum eigentlich keinen Zutritt hatte. Der Anwalt l?ste das Bild aus dem
Rahmen und nahm es unbemerkt mit. "Er war ?berrascht, dass dies alles so
einfach gegangen sei", berichtete Verteidiger Hans Ulrich Beust.

Sp?ter legte der 41-J?hrige die Leinwand in einen Koffer und vertraute
diesen einem Bekannten an. Den machte er Glauben, es handele sich um
pornographischen "Schmuddelkram". Der Verlust wurde in dem Museum erst im
Laufe des n?chsten Tages entdeckt. Die Sicherheitsm?ngel sollen inzwischen
beseitigt worden sein.

Die Polizei war durch einen anonymen Hinweis auf die Spur des Diebes
gekommen. Der wurde bei der vereinbarten Besichtigung des Bildes in Bruchsal
festgenommen. Das Gem?lde, das bereits seit 100 Jahren im Besitz des Museums
ist und dessen Wert sich auf rund 500000 Euro bel?uft, wurde dort inzwischen
wieder aufgeh?ngt.

Der Angeklagte hat seine Zulassung als Rechtsanwalt inzwischen zur?ckgegeben
und seine Kanzlei geschlossen. "Er steht finanziell vor dem Nichts", glaubt
Verteidiger Beust.

Noch schwerer als der Diebstahl wiegen die Vorw?rfe, die seine Frau gegen
den 41-J?hrigen erhebt. Sie hatte nach dessen Festnahme behauptet, ihr Mann
habe sie vergewaltigt und misshandelt. Verteidiger Beust bezeichnete dies
als "v?llig haltlos". Die Frau habe nicht deutlich gemacht, dass sie keinen
Sex w?nsche. Die Ehe, die 2004 geschlossen wurde, sei nicht gl?cklich
gewesen. Die Gattin habe ihren Mann mit "absurden und h?sslichen
Eifersuchtsszenen" zugesetzt. Die Frau soll am Montag als Zeugin geh?rt
werden. Gegen sie wird wegen des Spitzweg-Diebstahls ermittelt.

F?r den Prozess sind neun Verhandlungstage anberaumt. Das Urteil wird f?r
den 12. Juni erwartet.

Heir of Jewish art dealer sues US gallery over Nazi loot 
Posted on donderdag 3 mei 2007 (EST) 


The heir of a Jewish art dealer whose entire collection was looted by Nazi
troops during World War II is suing a US museum that acquired two of the
stolen paintings more than 35 years ago.  

NEW YORK (AFP) - Marei von Saher, the daughter-in-law of noted art dealer
Jacques Goudstikker, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday against the Norton Simon
Museum in Pasadena, California, her lawyers said in a statement issued
Wednesday. 

Von Saher and the museum had been in talks over the paintings for some years
but the two parties failed to reach a settlement, the lawyers said. 

At stake are two life-size paintings of Adam and Eve by 15th century artist
Lucas Cranach the Elder, which Von Saher's lawyers said were among the most
important works in Goudstikkers collection of more than 1,300 artworks. 

The paintings, most of them Old Masters today worth hundreds of thousands of
dollars apiece, were looted in 1940 when Nazi troops invaded the
Netherlands. While some of the collection has been returned, many paintings
remain missing. 

Luftwaffe commander Hermann Goering was among the officers who looted
Goudstikker's gallery, taking some works back to Germany. 

The two paintings in the current dispute were acquired by the Norton Simon
Museum in or about 1971, according to Von Saher's lawyers, who have
challenged the museum's contention that it has fair title to the paintings. 

Last year the Dutch government returned around 200 paintings that had been
looted from the Goudstikker collection to Von Saher. Around 30 of them were
sold at auction in New York last month, fetching almost 10 million dollars. 

Goudstikker was forced to abandon his collection when he fled the
Netherlands in 1940. However, a notebook in which he recorded details of
over 1,000 of his works has proved invaluable in the search for the lost
paintings.

Library fire likely sparked by construction accident
The Associated Press
2007-05-03 21:11:23.0
Current rank: # 1,710 of 9,340 

WASHINGTON - 
A fire that severely damaged the Georgetown public library and some of the
valuable documents inside likely was accidentally started by construction
workers, fire officials said Thursday.

The 72-year-old building was being renovated when the fire broke out Monday,
burning portions of the roof and damaging irreplaceable documents and
artworks in the Peabody Room.

A mechanical heating device in use at the time likely touched off the blaze,
said Alan Etter, a District of Columbia fire spokesman.

Officials had not come up with a damage estimate Thursday, Etter said,
because they had to take into account both the value of the building and at
the artifacts in the Peabody collection.

The collection includes valuable books, paintings, rare maps of Civil War
fortifications and copies of newspapers that contained stories about the
signing of the Declaration of Independence. It also includes files on every
home in Georgetown, a historic district.

Library officials have said that most of the items were not burned but did
sustain water damage, and that many could likely be salvaged.

Salzburg: Vier Skulpturen verschwunden

Galerie bef?rchtet Diebstahl, Ausstellungsleitung der Kunstmesse glaubt an
Irrtum der Spedition

Salzburg - Vier Skulpturen im Gesamtwert von rund 75.000 Euro sind am
Dienstag nach Ostern nach Ende der Kunst-und Antiquit?tenmesse in der
Salzburger Residenz verschwunden. Die bestohlene Galerie bef?rchtet einen
Diebstahl, die Ausstellungsleitung glaubt eher an einen Irrtum bei der
Spedition, berichten die "Salzburger Nachrichten".

Cragg, Kolig, Kogelnik fehlen

Carolin Walker von der Galerie Schloss Ebenau in Rosental in K?rnten hatte
die verpackten Skulpturen nach der Ausstellung im Hof der Alten Residenz auf
einen Rollwagen gestellt und zum Spediteur gebracht, dann ging sie nochmals
kurz weg, und danach waren die Kartons weg. Walker dachte, dass sie die
Spedition bereits verpackt hat. Erst in K?rnten bemerkte sie das Fehlen von
vier Kunstwerken, und zwar eine Skulptur von Anthony Cragg, eine
Blumenpalette von Cornelius Kolig und zwei Plastiken von Kiki Kogelnik.

Im Lieferbereich, betonte die ?ffentlichkeitsabteilung der Messe gegen?ber
derStandard.at, seien die Galeristen selbst f?r die Sicherheit der
Kunstwerke zust?ndig. Das Areal falle aus dem Zust?ndigkeitsbereich der
Messe, vor allem auch nach Ende der Veranstaltung, heraus.

Der Versicherer geht von einem Diebstahl aus, weil inzwischen so viel Zeit
vergangen sei, so dass die verschwundenen Werke in der Zwischenzeit
auftauchen h?tten m?ssen. Alexandra Graski-Hoffmann, Gesch?ftsf?hrerin des
Messeveranstalters MAC Hoffmann, entgegnete: "Es gibt keine Anzeichen, dass
es eine professionelle Truppe war", vielleicht habe ein anderer Spediteur
versehentlich die Kartons eingepackt. "Von Diebstahl ist das weit entfernt."

Thieves grab British Museum exhibits

POLICE are investigating how 10 artefacts were stolen from a Chinese
exhibition at the British Museum.
The thefts occurred on the same day, October 30, 2004, despite sophisticated
security systems at the museum, in Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury.
Only two out of 13 historic pieces stolen from the museum since 2001 have
been recovered by police from the Met's specialist arts and antiquities
squad.
Details of the thefts were released to the New Journal under the Freedom of
Information Act.
The Chinese pieces stolen included a pair of gold earrings from the Yuan
Dynasty, dating from between 1279 and 1368, a pair of gilt bronze hairpins
from the Tang dynasty (618-906), and a gold fingernail guard from the
Tang-Yuan Dynasty.
The museum has not revealed how much the items are worth, how they were
taken or if the thefts were the work of more than one person.
A museum spokesman said: "In common with major national museums in this
country, the British Museum cannot insure its objects, as they are of such
high value. The museum's collections are covered by government indemnity."
Other stolen artefacts include a late 18th restoration of a Roman marble
hand, taken in July, 2002.
The only stolen pieces recovered have been a Greek marble head, from 324BC,
and an oak table clock by Benjamin Lewis Vuilliamy. A man was subsequently
charged with handling stolen goods following the theft of the clock in
October last year.
Police inquiries are continuing into the other thefts.
The museum spokesman said: "The British Museum considers the security of its
collection to be one of its highest priorities and takes all necessary
precautions to ensure the safety of the objects in its care."

Stash of cash missing from currency museum
  
The Edmonton Journal 


Monday, April 30, 2007


OTTAWA - Someone has helped themselves to a few choice specimens from the
Bank of Canada's currency museum, newly released documents show.

Bank officials are short about $16,700 following the unsolved theft at the
central bank's popular tourist attraction.

"There is no plausible explanation for the discrepancy other than theft,"
says an internal audit obtained by The Canadian Press under the Access to
Information Act.

"The procedures for note holdings should have been stronger ... some of the
procedures that did exist were not followed."

The missing money came not from the display cases, but disappeared from a
stash of cash the museum uses to help teach visitors about counterfeit
currency.

The so-called note exchange program allowed patrons to swap their old-style
bills for new-series money with special security features designed to thwart
counterfeiters.

The popular program, created in 2001, has been abruptly cancelled in the
wake of the currency caper.

Man arrested in theft of Old Salem pottery
He's charged with possessing stolen ceramics


By Dan Galindo
JOURNAL REPORTER

Winston-Salem police have arrested one man in connection with the theft of
20 pieces of Moravian pottery from Old Salem.

The ceramic pottery taken includes a few replicas, which have little value,
along with original plates, bowls and jugs from the 19th and late-18th
centuries.

Police have recovered at least 14 of the pieces after arresting David Curtis
Barrow, 56, of 413 Holiday St. on Monday at Brookstown Antiques &
Consignment on Brookstown Road.

According to Lee French, the president of Old Salem Inc., the same man had
sold stolen pottery pieces at the store, then returned Monday to sell more.

Old Salem officials had notified local antique dealers after the thefts and
asked them to be on the lookout.

French said they confirmed that the first pieces sold to the store were
stolen, and then police were ready in case the seller returned.

Barrow is charged with possession of stolen property and carrying a
concealed gun, which police say was a loaded gun found in his car. He has
not been charged with the break-ins or thefts and is out of jail after
posting a $15,000 bond.

He did not return a phone message yesterday.

The pottery pieces were taken in break-ins on the night of April 11 at
Winkler Bakery and on April 15 at the Vierling House.

Old Salem officials declined to say how much the pieces are worth. One
police report lists six stolen pieces as valued at $2,400.

Police declined to comment on the case yesterday other than to say they were
still investigating.

The stolen pieces are not the elaborately decorated plates often associated
with Moravians - they are more like the sturdy wares that would be used
around the house, said Johanna Brown, the director of collections at Old
Salem and curator of Moravian decorative arts.

"It's sort of the Rubbermaid of the 19th century," Brown said.

The Tales Pollen Tells
The rise of forensic palynology, a once obscure science.

 
For more on this fascinating subject, visit the Web site of University of
Western Australia palynontologist Lynne Milne at: http://tinyurl.com/39nxd4.

 
 In 1988 Marion True, at that time the J. Paul Getty Museum's antiquities
director, paid a record $18 million for a 5th century BC Greek statue that
she said would become "the single greatest piece of classical art in our
collection." It is still one of its most prized artifacts. Almost 20 years
later, True is on trial in Rome for trafficking in looted art, and her
conviction or release may hinge on an analysis of the pollen found in the
folds of the excavated statue's robes. If the pollen is of Sicilian origin,
it may have been looted from a site there after Italy's 1939 prohibition on
exporting antiquities without a permit. But if it is of North African
origin, where similar statues have been found, there is no problem. 

Viewed under the microscope, pollen grains have an endlessly diverse variety
of forms. The shell of pollen grains is highly resistant to degradation, so
pollen grains can fossilize, and are used to track and date geological
strata. They can also be used in tracking and solving crimes and other
puzzles. 

During the massacre of Bosnians in and around Srebrenica in the summer of
1995, one execution and burial site was in a field of wheat. Later, the
bodies were dug up and reburied in smaller numbers elsewhere, to diminish
the evidence for a massacre. Their origin was traced to the wheat field
through the presence of distinctive pollen in soil recovered from them. This
finding was important court evidence against those involved in the
Srebrenica atrocities. 

Between 1975 and 1978, after the end of the Vietnam War, a story emerged
from the Hmong tribesmen who live in the hills bordering Laos and Cambodia,
of a so-called yellow rain alleged to have fallen from the sky, often after
planes had passed over. The "rain" caused heavy bleeding from the nose and
gums, blindness, tremors, seizures, other neurologic symptoms, and death. It
led to serious allegations of chemical warfare by the United States against
the Soviet Union, which was supposed to have supplied chemical weapons to
the Vietnam government. 

Samples of yellow spots on leaves were submitted for chemical analysis and
initially gave positive results for mycotoxins, fungal poisons that can
cause a variety of symptoms and, in the long run, liver cancer. But this
result was unreproducible. Eventually, microscopic analysis showed that the
yellow spots were bee feces containing tree pollen. A swarm of bees had
erupted from a tree-top hive, like a bucket brigade carrying out the slops,
dumping them all over the neighborhood. This new finding for apiology [study
of bees] was confirmed by actual observation in the hill forest by
entomologists, who were caught in a yellow fecal shower during a field trip
to the location of an alleged attack. It strains credulity that Russian
chemical warfare agents went around harvesting tree pollen in large
quantities to disguise a mycotoxin weapon. 

In 1999, at a conference of the Missouri Botanical Society, a pollen
specialist with the Israel Antiquities Authority reported that pollen spores
found on the Shroud of Turin were typical of those of plants growing around
Jerusalem. A Swiss police criminologist, who had earlier been in trouble for
faking evidence, had given the samples of the shroud to him, thus leaving
the finding in doubt. 

The late Andy Spielman of Harvard University, a highly respected medical
entomologist, had a bee in his bonnet about pollen and malaria. He claimed
that the recent large increase in malaria transmission in parts of
sub-Saharan Africa was linked to the increase in the cultivation of maize in
those areas. Huge quantities of pollen produced by the crop settle on the
mud puddles, which are the preferred breeding sites for the Anopheles
arabiensis mosquito, providing a rich food supply for the larvae and
producing bumper crops of the malaria vector. Many of his associates and
students thought he was a bit unhinged about the subject, but he has been
vindicated by the finding that the large increase in malignant tertian
malaria in parts of Ethiopia is in fact correlated with the intensification
of maize cultivation. 


Thus the lowly pollen grain has shown its utility in the fields of
archaeology, criminology, biowarfare investigation, and epidemiology, far
beyond its primary purpose of acting as simply the transmitter of DNA from
one plant generation to the next. Remember that, the next time you curse
pollen for your spring allergy or for messing up the shine on your
automobile.

Fort Lauderdale's Museum of Art to close this summer for repairs 
By Emma Trelles
Arts Writer

May 3, 2007



The Museum of Art in Fort Lauderdale will close its doors to the public
during the summer months. Starting June 1, the museum begins the overhaul of
its security and fire suppression systems, as well as renovations to make
the venue more accessible for people with disabilities. The museum's
executive committee decided on the action last Thursday, citing the slow
summer season as an apt time to protect its artworks and least affect
visitors. The summer art camp, held in nearby studio space, will continue as
scheduled.

"The Tut renovations were just the beginning of the improvements," says
director Irv Lippman, who adds that other tweaks include replacement of the
front doors and windows, which were not constructed to hurricane-proof code
during the Tutankhamun exhibit. The first- and second-floor public restrooms
are also slated for refurbishing, and the museum plans on sprucing up its
entrance and lobby areas in anticipation of its 50-year anniversary in 2008.

"It's not uncommon to take an intermission," Lippman says. "When the work
has to get done, it has to get done." Around the country other arts venues
undergo their own makeovers, including the Amon Carter Museum in Fort Worth
and New York City's Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center.

Funding was raised in part by a challenge posed by the Museum of Art's past
chair, Spie Eagon, who promised $100,000 toward building repairs if the
board matched an additional $400,000. It did, with an extra quarter of a
million granted by board member Holly Hudson Bodenweber. But the museum is
doubling fund-raising efforts because the $750,000 in hand still does not
cover its costs.

"The building is 20 years old, and we've had over 1million visitors in the
last three years. It really puts us in the forefront of art museums in terms
of attendance. During Tut the pipes blew in the restrooms from overuse,"
Lippman says. He explains the million-dollar grant the county gave the
museum last year mostly helped with structural repairs, such as a new roof
and air conditioning system, but these were bare necessities to accommodate
Tut.

"This is a building designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes; it's a gem and it
needs to be refurbished."

Because of the upgrades, the museum has postponed "Unbroken Ties: Dialogues
in Cuban Art," a show mostly composed of paintings and photographs by both
exiled and national Cuban artists; it's now slated to open in April of next
year. "Situational Comedy: Humor in Recent Art" has been canceled.

The museum opens its coming season on Sept. 7 with "The Quilts of Gee's
Bend." The show features the quilts of four generations of African-American
women from the rural Alabama community of Gee's Bend.

Lessons From a Library Fire

Saturday, May 5, 2007; A16



I was astounded to read in the May 2 front-page article "Across D.C., Dozens
of Hydrants Are Broken" that "fire and union officials say the faulty
hydrants often aren't discovered until a fire breaks out, as was the case in
Georgetown" at the library fire. Later the article explained that repair of
the hydrants is the D.C. Water and Sewer Authority's responsibility.

The responsibility for repairing hydrants may be WASA's. However, the
responsibility to know which hydrants are bad or good lies with the D.C.
fire department.

I worked my way through college as a firefighter elsewhere. A large part of
our "between calls" time was spent checking the hydrants in our district. We
were obligated to test the flow and pressure of each hydrant every two
months. We recorded the results on a map, so that the company commander knew
where to find a good hydrant long before we pulled up to a fire.

I walk by a D.C. fire station every morning these days. Those firefighters
are out there diligently testing and cleaning their equipment, as every good
fire company should. But what about the hydrants? Is knowing that they have
a functioning hydrant less important than knowing that they have a
functioning ladder or siren?

I hope that the administrators and staff of the Martin Luther King Jr.
Memorial Library downtown read Sean Steele's May 3 letter, "An Avoidable
Library Fire," about cluttered District public libraries and fire hazards,
because they've been propping open the clearly marked fire doors for years.

Thankfully, no lives were lost in the fire at the Georgetown public library
on April 30, but we were not completely spared. Hand-colored maps of
Georgetown in the 1870s, a painting of Key Bridge and a document signed by
Francis Scott Key, all historically important objects, were threatened by
the fire. Across the nation, similar small institutions hold collections
that tell the stories of local communities and our nation's history.

A report by the U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Services and Heritage
Preservation identified emergency planning, environmental and storage
conditions, staffing, and funding as aspects of collections stewardship that
have the greatest needs. If these needs are not addressed, many collections
are at risk for damage or loss.

In June, library and museum representatives from each state will meet here
to launch a nationwide conservation initiative. We are committed to raising
awareness of the need to protect library and museum collections -- because
they are our collective collections, too.

An Aspen police investigator recovered two paintings Thursday at the home of
a Denver man who allegedly stole them from an Aspen Gallery. 

Lakewood police detained Tyson Hurd, 32, on suspicion of burglary.

The paintings, in Aspen Police custody Friday, are from the private
collection of the Goss family, owners of Gypsy Woman Gallery on Main Street
in Aspen. 

Aspen artist Earl Biss' two oil paintings, "Indians in a Storm" and
"Swimming Toward the Light," are valued at up to $90,000 each, American
Design Gallery President Paul Zueger said.

The Goss family first notified Aspen police April 14 when they noticed one
painting was missing. They believed someone lifted the painting off the wall
during business hours, Aspen police investigator Eric Ross said.

But, on April 17, owners of the American Design Gallery in Denver notified
police they bought what they thought was a stolen painting from Hurd. The
descriptions matched, Ross said.

Hurd also offered the Denver gallery a second painting, and the suspected
theft became a suspected burglary; the Goss family searched their inventory
and found a second Biss painting missing - something only an insider would
know, Ross said.

Hurd sold the painting to the Denver gallery for $8,500, Ross said.

"He knows the family. He knew the layout. It would be an easy thing to do,"
said Lou Lou Goss, whose family owns the gallery and who was formerly
married to Biss, who died in 1998.

Hurd had a previous relationship with Lou Lou Goss, she said, and Ross
believed Hurd banked on what he knew about the family and the gallery to
steal two valuable paintings.

Ross went to Denver on April 18 and contacted Hurd at his home.

When questioned, Hurd said he bought the paintings at an estate sale and
contended the other was in the custody of his brother, Ross said.

Hurd agreed to meet with Ross again in Denver on Thursday. When Hurd
produced the second painting, Ross served him with an arrest warrant.
Lakewood police took Hurd into custody.

Hurd will soon be transported to Pitkin County jail. Monday he will face
charges of second-degree burglary - a Class 4 felony - as well as felony
theft and felony receiving (for selling the painting). Both theft charges
are Class 3 felonies because of the high value of the paintings, Deputy
District Attorney Gail Nichols said.

Owners of the American Design Gallery said they will file separate fraud
charges against Hurd.
