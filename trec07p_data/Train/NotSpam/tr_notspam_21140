There are timing issues in vmware; basically you can only wind the clock up 
to 8192hz under Linux host os and 1024hz under Windows which can make 
millisecond timing flakey.
I had trouble getting festival working under vmware workstation 5.5, perhaps 
I was doing something wrong. We intend to try this sort of config for a 
course we are teaching.
I have tried installing fedora core 7 onto a vm; however the system crashes 
whilst "loading udev..." and won't boot further.
Debian etch had strange probems in vmware workstation 6, I intend to retry 
that and also workstation 5.5.
Regards, Kerry.
