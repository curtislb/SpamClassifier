Ali Aboutaam


Dear Ton,

Could you please share the following message with your readers...

May I kindly ask... Where is the logic in all of this?

Tomorrow I will be defending myself (again) in the High Court, London,
against claims of slander brought on by the convicted and notorious Aboutaam
brothers, Ali and Hicham, formerly and presently on the radar of several law
enforcement agencies. 

A long list of witnesses including: Cambridge-McDonald-Institute
archaeologist Dr. Neil Brodie... Founder and former head of New Scotland
Yard Art and Antique Squad Richard Ellis... Colonel Matthew Bogdanos...
Former head (recently sadly deceased) of Mossad Hesi Carmel, all provided
statements towards my defence and credibility and the scandalous track
record in the artworld of the Aboutaams.

The only witnesses the Aboutaam Brothers provided to the court where
themselves.

May I ask you politely to share the Interpol details with your readers, of
which I know that many are active in law enforcement. ?
