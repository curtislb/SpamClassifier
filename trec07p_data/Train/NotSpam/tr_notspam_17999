You mean definitely ?
According the list, debian.co.il mirrors from mirror.hamakor.org.

s/ppc/sparc/

mirror.inter.net.il was commented because of a downtime due to RAID
issues. Since we have not be notified when the sever went back, it has
not been uncommented.

I have just uncommented it.
But :
- the DNS resolves in IPv6 while neither the HTTPD nore the FTPD are
  available by IPv6.
- there are undesirable non-us directories in debian/ and debian/pool/


> 2. http://mirror.isoc.org.il/pub/debian/ which has amd64 and i386 packages.

For this one, the admin should add it: http://debian.org/mirrors/submit

No need, since choose-mirror updates its list at build time.

We can ask the debian-installer team to rebuild choose-mirror in the
case no rebuild was planned.
