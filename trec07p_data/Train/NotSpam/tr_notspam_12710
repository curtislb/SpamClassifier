You can just about anything you like in a cron job.  if it can run in  
a script, it can run as a job.
Secondly, just run the program (use the whole path and don't rely on  
the parcer of the interpreter to find it for you.  I.E. /usr/bin/more  
instead of just more.
This prevents hackers from overriding the programs being executed.
Also, when you put it in a cron job, the output of the job will be  
emailed to root (unless you specify otherwise) so you'll know if it  
worked or not.
But, most programs (and I'm sure appget is amoung them) have an error  
code to determine if they exited successfully or not.
Simply test for the code after the program ends if you really need to  
know, but it shouldn't matter, since you can view the output of the  
job if so desired.
