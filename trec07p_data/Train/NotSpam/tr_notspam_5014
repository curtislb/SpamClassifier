Lou Dobbs Tonight
Wednesday, April 25, 2007

Tonight, the pinnacle battle in the war in Iraq escalates;
General Petraeus meets with members of Congress. We’ll have the
latest from Capitol Hill.

A former employee of America’s largest nuclear plant has
allegedly given software and plant information to Iran. Federal
authorities say Mohammad “Mo” Alavi, a former engineer in the
Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station for 16 years, illegally
gave software codes to Iran along with information on reactor
designs. Officials arrested Alavi this month in Los Angeles on
charges of violating the U.S. trade embargo with Iran. We’ll
have a special report.

New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo is leading the fight
against corruption involving some lenders and student financial
aide officers. Cuomo testifies today before the House Committee
on Education and Labor as they investigate this scandal. We'll
have a special report on the corruption and cronyism plaguing
America’s student loan companies and financial aid offices.

Leading talk radio hosts are broadcasting for a third day today
from Capitol Hill.  The 35 radio hosts want Congress and the
President to hear the voices of their listeners who are
demanding an end to any legislation that will grant a guest
worker program or amnesty to the millions of illegal aliens
living in America. We’ll have full coverage.

The prosecution is expected to wrap up its case today in the
trial of naturalized American citizen and electrical engineer.
Chi Mak is on trial for allegedly passing vital U.S. military
secrets to the communist Chinese government. Mak could take the
stand as early as today. We'll have report live from the
courthouse in Santa Ana, California.
