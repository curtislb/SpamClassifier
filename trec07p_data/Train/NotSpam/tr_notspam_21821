The only thing xp is stupid about is it won't let you define or set up 
partitions larger than 32767 gb.  Now, that number reminds me of 
intiger basic.

2 to the power of 16 = 32768 so that's a 16-bit address.
Same reason why integers max out at 32768 if 16-bit numbers.

Remember the old 640kb limit in DOS? Apparently IBM said 
nobody would ever use that much memory hehe. Now you can
buy terrabyte drives for cheap.
