Priceless artifacts returned to Ancient Agora

    A poignant ceremony was held at the Ancient Athens Agora's Stoa of 
Attalus on Wednesday to mark the return of six priceless black-glazed 
ceremonial pottery pieces from the collection of eminent British scholar 
and philhellene Martin Robertson.  

    The miniature artifacts were bequeathed to the Athens Agora's 
museum, as stipulated in Robertson's will, following his death in 
December 2004. The author of the authoritative "A History of Greek Art" 
(Cambridge University Press 1975), considered his magnum opus, inherited 
the items from American archaeologist Lucy Talcott, the recording 
secretary of Agora excavations in the 1930s and ?40s.

    The artifacts were officially presented by one of Robertson's sons, 
Stephen, at the ceremony, who stressed that he was bringing a gift by 
his father to "his beloved Greece". Stephen Robertson also drew a 
comparison to the ongoing campaign for return of the Parthenon Marbles 
to Athens, saying Wednesday's ceremony can demonstrate to the British 
Museum's administration that a similar return of antiquities is not 
impossible.

    On his part, the curator of the Acropolis archaeological site, 
Alexandros Mantis, expressed his thanks to the Robertson family, before 
noting that the artifacts return marks the eighth repatriation over the 
past year of artifacts taken from Acropolis-related sites.  

    Finally, Culture Minister George Voulgarakis expressed his 
satisfaction with the fact the ceremony coincided with UNESCO's World 
Heritage Day.

Will Elgin Marbles Ever Make It Back to Athens? Martin Gayford

By Martin Gayford

April 17 (Bloomberg) -- Is there the merest hint of movement in the 
world's most intractable restitution drama? That is, the issue of the 
Elgin -- or, if you prefer, Parthenon -- Marbles, which has flared up at 
intervals since Lord Elgin removed them from the Acropolis at Athens in 
the 19th century.

Neil MacGregor, director of the British Museum, appeared to open the 
door to compromise in an interview with Bloomberg News, but only by a 
fraction of an inch. In principle, would he and the trustees consider a 
request from Athens to borrow the marbles?

``There is no reason why any object in the BM -- if it is fit to travel 
-- shouldn't spend three months, six months somewhere else,'' he said. 
``So, in principle, absolutely yes. The difficulty at the moment which 
would stand in the way of that is that the Greek government has 
formally, and recently, refused to acknowledge that the trustees are the 
owners of the objects. Therefore, in law the trustees could not possibly 
lend them.''

In addition, he said, ``the Greek government has never asked for a loan 
of the material from the British Museum. The issue has always been about 
the permanent removal of all the Parthenon material in the BM collection 
to Athens.''

Might that be the basis for some sort of compromise? Ownership, of 
course, is at the heart of the dispute. That question was raised as long 
ago as 1816, when Elgin sold the sculptures to the British government. 
His right of possession depends on interpretation of a letter of 
permission from an official of the Ottoman Empire, then ruling Greece.

Original Documents

The original document and the Ottoman regime both disappeared many years 
ago, and possession counts for a lot in law.

According to a legal opinion quoted by the historian William St. Clair 
in his book, ``Lord Elgin and the Marbles'' (1998), Elgin's actions were 
``probably technically legal at the time,'' though threats and bribery 
may have played a part. Any attempt by the Greek government ``to try to 
recover the marbles in an international court would probably fail.''

It would be politically impossible for any Greek government to give way 
on this point because the marbles have become a symbol of Hellenic 
national identity. Professor Anthony Snodgrass, chair of the British 
Committee for the Reunification of the Parthenon Marbles, said: ``This 
offer is a theoretical one in every sense. Mr. MacGregor knows that no 
Greek government could ever make a formal concession that the BM has 
legal ownership.''

Log-Jam

On the other hand, the British Museum understandably fears that if it 
gave way in this case, it, and other major museums, would receive an 
avalanche of demands from around the world for the return of items 
acquired by fair, and less than fair, means in the colonial era.

So, stalemate? Maybe not. There was considerable speculation about a 
possible loan to coincide with the Athens Olympics in 2004. That came to 
nothing, partly because of the postponement of the opening of the new 
Acropolis Museum, which is now years behind schedule after a log-jam of 
legal disputes about home demolitions, completion of archaeological digs 
and cost over-runs.

That gleaming institution is set for completion this summer and 
inauguration in the autumn. Meanwhile, the British Museum is becoming 
more and more enthusiastic about temporary exhibitions. A blockbuster, 
the Terracotta Army, opens in September. Brand new, much larger 
exhibition galleries are scheduled for 2012.

Spectacular Show

There is scope for a spectacular and -- from the scholarly point of view 
-- exciting exhibition about the Parthenon sculptures. It is often 
assumed that all of them are in London. Actually, Elgin only extracted 
about half from the temple.

Most or the rest are still in Athens, with a couple of panels in the 
Louvre and fragments scattered all over the place. In some cases, 
fragments of the same figure are on opposite side of Europe. The 
celebrated frieze is split in two.

If you could put it all back together, you'd have the blockbuster to end 
all blockbusters. Setting the question of ownership aside, that's a 
prospect to entice any museum director.

Perhaps we should admit that the dispute about ownership is 
unresolvable. In the diplomatic world, the only way forward in such 
difficult cases is to find a formula that each side can accept. Is there 
one here? ``The very most that might be negotiable,'' Snodgrass said, 
``would be an agreement by the Greek government that the marbles were 
legally acquired from Lord Elgin by Parliament, for the Museum.''

Is that enough? The reward for an agreement -- especially for the 
art-loving public of the world -- would be enormous.

Saints preserve us ? statue of St. Anthony stolen

Thursday, April 19, 2007
ALAN HUSTAK

THE GAZETTE

The patron saint of stolen objects has been stolen.

A life-size bronze statue of St. Anthony has vanished from a grave in 
Notre Dame des Neiges cemetery, and relatives of the deceased are 
praying to the patron saint of lost and stolen items ? St. Anthony 
himself ? for its safe return.

The bronze in the sculpture is estimated to be worth at least $10,000.

The statue was erected 50 years ago to mark the tomb of Anthony 
Stefaniuk. His widow, Anna Solohub, reported to be the first person to 
die while visiting the Expo 67 world?s fair site 40 years ago, is also 
buried in the plot.

Bettie Klemchuck, a great-niece of the deceased couple, noticed the 
statue was missing when she went to visit her mother?s grave Tuesday.

?It?s pathetic to think someone would stoop so low to steal from a 
cemetery,? she said Thursday.

?We?re a sick world. We really, really are.

?The dead have gone to their rest. They should be resting. We?re praying 
to St. Anthony to get it back. He?s the saint you pray to when you lose 
things. He?s been stolen. He?s lost.?

The gravesite apparently was vandalized between Palm Sunday, April 1, 
and Easter Sunday, April 8.

Whoever took the statue had to have planned the theft carefully, 
Klemchuck said.

?Obviously, someone was out for the money. One person alone couldn?t 
carry the statue away.

?To replace something like that these days would cost $30,000 or so. 
People can?t afford these things any more.?

The statue is one of more than a dozen bronze tombstone decorations that 
have disappeared from the cemetery in the past five years.

Among the more prominent works that have vanished are a bust of 
Pierre-Pascal Bourque by Quebec sculptor Louis-Philippe Hbert ? worth 
more as a work of art than for the price of its bronze ? and a bust and 
decorative bronze medallions from the grave of Alfred Laliberte.

While the ?appropriate security measures? to prevent vandalism are 
taken, cemetery general manager Yoland Tremblay said, it is impossible 
to monitor 55,500 tombstones 24 hours a day.

Experience suggests not all gravesite decorations reported stolen are, 
in fact, stolen, he said.

?All the bronze pieces in the cemetery belong to the families that 
commissioned them,? he said.

?We have had instances where one family member removed an ancestral 
bronze without telling other descendants. Sometimes pieces have been 
taken away to be restored.

?Of the dozen or so bronzes that have were reported stolen, four have 
been recovered or accounted for.?

Tremblay said the cemetery is not patrolled between 1 a.m. and 6 a.m., 
but because all its gates are locked after dark, it would be impossible 
to enter with a truck that thieves would need to remove big statues.

The theft of bronze statues and memorial plaques in and around Montreal 
has become chronic in recent years.

More than two dozen metal historical markers have been ripped from sites 
in Old Montreal in the past two years.

Last week, St. Joachim parish in Chateauguay reported that a Parks 
Canada bronze marker identifying the church as a national historic site 
had been stolen in the first week of April.

    Kashmiris robbed of their rich cultural heritage

Srinagar, April 19 (KMS): In occupied Kashmir, President of Jammu and 
Kashmir Writers? Association (JKWA), Ghulam Nabi Khayal has said that 
Kashmir has been robbed of its historical artefacts and cultural 
heritage in the name of security. 

Khayal was speaking in a program organized to observe World Heritage 
Day. JKWA President said, ?The centuries old historical arte-facts and 
cultural heritage excavated from different places in occupied Kashmir, 
like Terracotta tiles of 2nd and 3rd centuries BC and 5000 years old 
findings in Burzahama were looted and clandestinely transferred to 
different parts of India in the name of security and chemical testing.? 

He said that if serious steps were not taken to ensure the return of 
this treasure, the days were not far away when Kashmir history would be 
limited to myths alone. He said that the recently discovered fossils of 
a mammoth elephant dating 1.5 lakh years ago were transferred to Jammu 
University. He said that deliberate attempts were being made to destroy 
the rich historical and cultural heritage of Kashmir. He added that 5000 
years? old history of Kashmir had got reduced only to documents. 

Speaking on the occasion a well-known historian, Fida Muhammad Husnain 
said, ?Kashmir has a distorted history and the only reason for this 
distortion is Indian occupation of Kashmir and we are living in an 
occupied land from ages and nobody can accept objectivity in these 
circumstances.? Kashmir, Husnain said, has the historical evidences of 
1st century existence. ?Ours is the land where world scholars meeting 
was held in the 1st century and the ruins of Parhaspora proves our 
eighth century identity.? 

Asserting that Kashmir has always met the step motherly approach from 
Indian authorities, Muhammad Saleem Baig said, Gilgit manuscripts 
containing Kashmiri paintings were shifted from the Valley to Delhi in 
1948 and till date we don?t know the reason behind the transfer of the 
valuable asset. He said, in 1895 Maharaja Hari Singh donated his Deewan 
Khana as museum for preservation of monuments but more than a century 
has passed but no building was constructed for preservation of cultural 
arts and historical treasures. 

Mocking at puppet regime?s inability to preserve the history and culture 
of Kashmir Hassrat Gadda said that in 1995 CRPF troopers had stolen 35 
art objects, which had not still gotten back. Gadda said that occupied 
Kashmir continued to be ignored by the puppet authorities. ?The advent 
of Islam gave identity to Kashmir,? said columnist Zahid. The Vice 
Chancellor Kashmir University, Prof Abdul Wahid Qureshi, Zarief Ahmad 
Zarief, Dr Farooq Fayaz, Abdul Ahad Farhad, and Dr Mufti Muhammad 
Maqbool also spoke on the occasion. 

Meanwhile, leading Kashmiri English daily, Greater Kashmir (GK), on this 
occasion deplored the loss of valuable Kashmiris heritage from the 
occupied territory. The editorial said that India and its puppet regime 
had failed to protect Kashmiris? millenniums old heritage. It commented, 
?There seems to be a deep conspiracy in neglecting the departments that 
have been set up for preservation of heritage of the state and promotion 
of culture?, adding, ?today both the museum and the department of 
archives are in utter shambles.? 

The editorial said that despite Kashmiri intellectuals, academicians, 
historians and media professionals? agitations and protests over the 
criminal neglect, there is no consideration for culture preservation as 
such. The GK termed it shameful that the archaeological finds from 
Burzehama, Harwan, Kotabul and many other places have been shifted to 
Calcutta under the pretext that they were not safe in the occupied 
territory.

  Rogue diggers helping themselves to Macedonia's ancient treasure

The Associated Press
Thursday, April 19, 2007

*DEDELI, Macedonia:* "Watch your step," goes a joke by archaeologists in 
Macedonia, "or you might crack an ancient pot."

It could happen: Tiny Macedonia ? which is slightly larger than Belgium 
but with a population of 2 million ? has some 6,000 registered 
archaeological sites.

Experts warn that since the country gained independence from Yugoslavia 
16 years ago, its ancient heritage has become increasingly vulnerable to 
looters who use sophisticated navigation and excavating equipment, 
leaving few sites unpillaged.

There is little to stop them.

A third of the country's work force is jobless, and the government says 
it can only afford to hire one dedicated official to tackle the rampant 
illegal antiquities trade.

"This is nothing but an open invitation for illegal diggers to come here 
looking for buried treasure," said 72-year-old Taip Tahiri, a retired 
teacher from the village of Dedeli, near Lake Dojran, about 180 
kilometers (112 miles) south of the capital Skopje. His family home 
stands next to a rich Iron Age site with 98 excavated tombs.

"This site has been explored a lot ... but groups of illegal diggers are 
still active in the area. Many of them made a fortune selling famous 
Macedonian bronzes to Greeks and other foreign buyers."

Irena Kolistrkoska, head of Macedonia's archaeologists' association, 
warned each year that scores of local and foreign diggers uncover 
priceless remnants from the Iron Age, as well as Greek, Thracian, Roman 
and Byzantine artifacts.

"There are two main reasons Macedonia is failing to seriously protect 
its cultural treasure: A lack of a strategy at a national level and the 
absence of credible experts in the field," Kolistrkoska said.

Pasko Kuzman, director of the National Directorate for Protection of the 
Cultural Heritage, said Iron Age archaeological sites in southeastern 
Macedonia have been extensively looted.

Police, he said, are already overstretched fighting organized crime, 
adding that fees offered by corrupt art collectors only encourage 
illegal excavations.

Macedonia, a landlocked nation in southeastern Europe, has a rich and 
storied past.

The country is part of the broader Macedonia region that includes parts 
of Greece and Bulgaria that became a major power in the ancient world 
under Phillip II of Macedon, and his son Alexander the Great. Alexander 
was one of the most successful military commanders in history, who built 
a vast empire that stretched to India before his death in 323 B.C.

Modern Macedonia's claim to the region's ancient heritage has infuriated 
neighbor Greece, which refuses to recognize the former Yugoslav republic 
by its official name, and is still seeking arbitration of the dispute at 
the United Nations.

Macedonia's south, on major east-west trading routes, was successively 
dominated by different civilizations ? ancient Macedonian, Roman, 
Byzantine and Ottoman.

"Macedonian bronze is trendy. It is world-famous because of the style 
and it can fetch very high prices on the black market," Kolistrkoska said.

"Even the smallest piece can be sold for ?1,000 (US$1,350)."

East of Dedeli lies Isar-Marvinci, where villagers are usually on hand 
to guide visitors up to a hillside to hunt for ancient fragments.

"You can easily find Roman coins or ceramics. Just look a little 
carefully. Every stone here is thousands of years old," said a villager, 
who refused to give his name or even his initials, fearing reprisals 
from other guides.

Fifteen other local men have been arrested for illegal excavation and 
trading in artifacts.

"As locals, we can find artifacts easily. But the state is not paying 
for them. We are jobless and foreigners are often around with money," 
the man said.

Kuzman said that during excavations at Isar-Marvinci between 1995 and 
2003, an estimated 2,500 artifacts were stolen.

"No one knows how many important national treasures have been smuggled 
out of the country, but it's clear the police don't yet have the means 
to stop it," he said.

While illegal digs are impossible to stop, Kuzman takes a long-term view 
and argues much of Macedonia's looted treasure can still eventually be 
tracked down abroad and returned.

"Every inch of this soil is so rich that many discoveries are still 
awaiting us," he said. "One of my dreams ... is to bring back to 
Macedonia a bronze bowl with a beautiful relief, which was recently 
traced to New York."

  Restituted Nazi paintings sold in NY

A collection of more than 30 old masters prints, looted from a Dutch 
dealer by the Nazis during World War II and returned to his heirs last 
year, has fetched almost $US10 million at auction.

The 31 lots sold for a total of $US9.7 million, Christie's auction house 
says.

A river landscape by Salomon van Ruysdael was the top-selling lot, 
selling for $US2.2 million.

The prints were part of a collection of 200 artworks looted by the Nazis 
in 1940 and restituted to Marei von Saher, the daughter-in-law of Jewish 
art dealer Jacques Goudstikker, by the Dutch Government last year.

Other works from the collection - which features Dutch old masters from 
the 15th to 19th centuries, as well as works from 16th century Germany 
and 18th century France - are to go on sale in London in July and 
Amsterdam in November.

"The Dutch Government's return of these pictures was a historic event 
for us and for all families whose possessions were stolen during the 
Holocaust era," Ms Von Saher said in a statement.

She says she was pleased with the sale.

"It was also a milestone in my family's mission to restore the legacy of 
Jacques Goudstikker and to recover the property that was stolen from his 
gallery," she said.

Marc Porter from Christie's described the collection as of "exceptional 
historical importance," while director Nicholas Hall said it was 
"arguably the most important collection of old master pictures ever 
restituted."

The paintings were looted when Nazi forces invaded the Netherlands in 1940.

Goudstikker fled the country with his wife and son and was forced to 
abandon his business and 1,400 works of art.

But he took with him a black notebook that recorded details of over 
1,000 of his pictures and proved essential in the search for his lost 
works.

While the Goudstikkers eventually managed to escape to the United 
States, Goudstikker died on the journey.

According to Christie's, Luftwaffe commander Hermann Goering was among 
the officers who looted Goudstikker's gallery, taking some works back to 
Germany.

And while some 280 paintings from the original collection were returned 
after the war, Dutch authorities held on to the prints and incorporated 
them into the Dutch national collection.

The heirs to the collection began an eight-year legal battle to win back 
the works in 1998.

Ms Von Saher remains committed to tracking down other works that were 
looted from the original collection and are believed to be spread around 
the world.

Art recovery specialist Clemens Toussaint is among those helping Ms Von 
Saher locate missing parts of the collection.

"This is perhaps the most comprehensive research project ever undertaken 
to track down a single-owner art collection looted by the Nazis and it 
is our goal to find every single work," he said.

Museum official faces art theft charges

AUSTIN, Texas, April 19 (UPI) -- A Texas art museum executive and his 
wife face accusations that they attempted to snatch paintings from an 
art festival.

Police in Austin, Texas, arrested Nathan Sheppard, 37, and his wife 
Alexandra, 33, Sunday. Nathan Sheppard, the Austin Museum of Art finance 
and operations director, was charged with burglary and evading arrest, 
while his wife was named in a burglary count, the Austin 
American-Statesman reported Wednesday.

Alexandra Sheppard was allegedly spotted by police Cmdr. Michael Jung 
walking among the tents of the Austin Fine Arts Festival in Republic 
Square Park early Sunday. She told the officer she was looking for her 
car and then allegedly said something in a foreign language that 
included the word "policia," the newspaper said.

The officer then saw that a zipper to one of the tents had been opened 
and allegedly noticed Nathan Sheppard inside holding two paintings. 
Sheppard allegedly dropped the paintings and ran. He was arrested a 
short distance away.

Nathan Sheppard has placed on administrative leave by the museum.

    Roban libros y grabados de muy alto valor

Policiales

19 de abril

Posadas (Noticias del 6). El lunes pasado, ladrones se alzaron con 
libros, l?minas y grabados robados de un dep?sito de la Aduana en Puerto 
Iguaz?, los mismos tienen un valor estimado en 55 mil d?lares, y seg?n 
estimaciones de un perito, se podr?a obtener un precio mucho mayor. Son 
obras de los siglos XVIII y XIX.

Por el hecho est?n detenidos los cuatro brasile?os que cometieron el 
robo y tambi?n cuatro paraguayos que intentaban trasponer la frontera 
con el bot?n oculto entre bolsas de harina y az?car.

El robo ocurri? el lunes a media ma?ana y hoy los sospechosos ser?an 
llevados al Juzgado Federal de Eldorado para ser indagados por su 
titular, Mario Hachiro Doi.

Los delincuentes le dijeron a los aduaneros del dep?sito que hab?an 
llegado all? para recuperar 39 libros antiguos, otro con fotograf?as de 
?poca encuadernado del Consejo Nacional de Educaci?n editado en 1889, 42 
grabados de mediados del siglo XIX y otros siete con grabados de 
paisajes y sitios hist?ricos de Argentina, tambi?n del siglo XIX.

Esos elementos hab?an sido decomisados el 27 de noviembre del a?o pasado

cuando el brasile?o Claudio Rodr?gues de Oliveira, de 29 a?os -oriundo 
de San Pablo- intentaba ingresar al pa?s con las obras de arte sin 
contar con la debida autorizaci?n.

Fuentes vinculadas a la investigaci?n sospechan que los delincuentes 
realizaron tareas de inteligencia previa y podr?an haber contado con 
apoyo local. Ahora se investiga si efectivamente la intenci?n era robar 
las obras para entregarlas nuevamente a Rodr?gues de Oliveira, como 
sostuvo uno de los detenidos
