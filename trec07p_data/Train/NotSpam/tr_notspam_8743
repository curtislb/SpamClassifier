solution to the problem of bank account phishing in the latest Foreign
Policy magazine. Hypponen thinks banks should have exclusive use of a new
top-level domain: .bank. 'Registering new domains under such a top-level
domain could then be restricted to bona fide financial organizations. And
the price for the domain wouldn't be just a few dollars: it could be
something like $50,000 — making it prohibitively expensive to most
copycats. Banks would love this. They would move their existing online
banks under a more secure domain in no time."

DrBenway sends us to Ars Technica for a report that Florida and Utah have
[0]placed draconian restrictions on the sale of used music CDs; Wisconsin
and Rhode Island may soon follow suit. In Florida, stores have to hold on
to CDs for 30 days before they can sell them — for store credit only, not
cash. Quoting: "No, you won't spend any time in jail, but you'll
certainly feel like a criminal once the local record shop makes copies of
all of your identifying information and even collects your fingerprints.
Such is the state of affairs in Florida, which now has the dubious
distinction of being so anal about the sale of used music CDs that record
shops there are starting to get out of the business of dealing with used
content because they don't want to pay a $10,000 bond for the 'right' to
treat their customers like criminals."

[0]netbuzz writes "A case of corporate bullying, or good network
citizenship? [1]Sprint Nextel has let slip the dogs of law on the FCC and
41 non-profits, most of them school systems, in an effort to get the FCC
to stop granting these organizations special dispensation when they fail
to renew their wireless spectrum licenses. These licenses were granted as
part of the Educational Broadband Service. The school systems, many of
them rural, argue that they don't have the staff or the resources to keep
on top of the paperwork and shouldn't be punished for such bureaucratic
lapses. (Some generate revenue by leasing unused portions of the spectrum
to carriers such as Sprint Nextel.) The schools' argument may sound a bit
like 'the dog ate my homework' to some, and Sprint Nextel makes a fairly
compelling case that a greater good would be served if the FCC would stop
enabling such tardiness."

An anonymous reader writes "When Yahoo!'s Jeremy Zawodny recently asked
[0]What the heck is Web 2.0 anyway? he received a set of responses
reminiscent of those garnered by The Register back in 2005, which
famously concluded, based on its readers' responses, that [1]Web 2.0 was
made up of 12% badger's paws, 6% JavaScript worms, and 26% nothing.
Nonetheless, as Social Computing (SoC) widens and deepens its footprint,
another Jeremy — Jeremy Geelan — has asked if we are [2]witnessing the
death of 'Personal' Computing. SoC, Geelan notes, has already become an
[3]academic [4]field of study. But perhaps Social Computing too is just

mrcaseyj writes "A post on the IE blog criticizes some banks for [0]no
longer using secure connections for entire login pages and only
encrypting the password as it goes back to the bank. This prevents simple
password sniffing but doesn't prevent a man in the middle attack from
replacing the unsecured login page with one that has disabled encryption.
This is especially a problem if you are using an unencrypted wireless
connection such as at a coffee shop, because hackers can easily use the
[1]airpwn package to intercept the login page and steal your password. An
easy remedy for when a secure page isn't available is to enter a bad
username and password which usually brings up a secure page telling you
to try again. But can you really trust your money to a bank that doesn't
even offer the option of a secure login page?"

some of the quirks of IPv4 reappearing. Ars Technica has an article
looking at the topic in depth, exploring the technical challenges of
securing the new protocol, and looking a the re-emergence of old problems
in new guises. 'Ironically, what's required to make IPv6 work through a
stateful firewall is almost identical to what's required to make IPv4
work though NAT. This means the IETF's efforts to keep IPv6 NAT-free in
order to make protocols do their job without messy workarounds are
defeated by the notion that everything should be firewalled.' If we
decide to stick with firewalls in IPv6, we'll see many of the same
hard-to-diagnose network problems that we have with IPv4."

smooth wombat writes "ABC and ESPN, both owned by Disney, have struck a
deal with cable operator Cox Communications to offer hit shows and
football games on demand, but with the condition that [0]Cox disable the
fast-forward feature that allows viewers to skip ads. This is the first
agreement of its kind. It only applies to Cox's video-on-demand service
and will not affect viewers using DVRs to fast-forward through ads. The
companies will also test technology that will place ads in shows based on
ZIP Codes and geographic area, and 'freshen' the ads with new ones every
few days."

elrous0 writes "Various news outlets are reporting that Europe's Galileo
program is [0]facing a serious financial and technical crisis and [1]may
be permanently stalled. The European program, designed to be a superior
answer to the US's GPS — and, more critically, not controlled by the US —
has faced numerous hurdles since its inception. To date the Galileo
program has succeeded in launching only one of its 30 planned satellites
and has been beset by delays and cost overruns. Apparently, squabbling
between the eight companies in the consortium behind the project is
responsible for many of the problems. The project is now threatened with
an EU takeover. But some [2]doubt that even an infusion of EU capital can
save the flagging program."

A number of readers let us know that Reuters and others are reporting
that Warner Brothers is [0]canceling movie previews in Canadian theaters,
starting with Oceans Thirteen. A Warner VP said, "Within the first week
of a film's release, you can almost be certain that somewhere out there a
Canadian copy will show up." Recently, the International Intellectual
Property Association [1]placed Canada on its Priority Watch List, along
with the likes of Argentina, China, Russia, Turkey, and Venezuela. This
community knows, thanks to Michael Geist, that [2]the claim is mostly
ficiton.

created by an ad hoc alliance called the Privacy Coalition (they oppose
the idea, but if you're a big Real ID fan you can use their site to send
adoring comments too). Alternatively, Homeland Security has finally seen
fit to give us an email address that you can use to submit comments on
the Real ID Act. Send email to [3]oscomments@dhs.gov with 'Docket No.

r7 writes "Internetnews is reporting on [0]Sun's introduction of JavaFX
at JavaOne today. Looks like a combination Applet, Flash, Javascript, and
AJAX with a friendly programming interface. Does this really spell the
end of AJAX? I sincerely hope so. Nothing built on Javascript will ever
achieve the security, cross-platform reliability, and programmatic
friendliness that Web 2.0 needs. Proprietary solutions and vendor lock-in
are also dead ends. JavaFX has the potential to satisfy this opportunity
even better than did Java over a decade ago. Along with AJAX, let's hope
JavaFX also puts paid to Microsoft's viral Active-X and JScript, and,
more importantly, that it really is a web scripting language that
developers can grok."

Improvements Act, a bill introduced recently by the Senate. The bill aims
to 'amend the federal criminal code to include a number of new clauses

include extensions to the prohibitions on the spread of false information
and mailing threats, increases to maximum prison terms, and allowances
for civil suits so that local and federal governments can attempt to
recoup expenses related to an incident.' This is undoubtedly a reaction
to the [1]Great Mooninite Scare of 2007."

will generate a random number, encrypt a copyrighted haiku with it, and
then deed the number back to you. You won't get a copyright on the number
or the haiku, but your number has become an [3]illegal circumvention
device under the DMCA, such that anyone subject to US law caught
distributing it can be punished under the DMCA's anti-trafficking
section, for which the DMCA's Safe Harbor provisions do not apply. So
