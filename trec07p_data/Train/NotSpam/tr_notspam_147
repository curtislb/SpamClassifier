Oliver,

Reading your thoughts and thinking this over, my current impression is that this could make a good wiki page or other tutorial.  Yes there are probably more people out there who would like to do this, but have not had the theory class to learn the details of how this method works.  But rather than give a function that hides the details, I would rather spell out the method (with some explanation) for them to follow, along with what checks need to be done along the way.

For example, this method only works if the desired correlation matrix is positive definite (one way to check this is that all the eigen values are positive), or a modification of this method can still work if it is positive semi-definite.  For the example correlations that started this thread, it worked out that inserting 0 for the non-specified correlations worked, but if the correlations had been enough higher, then 0 would not have worked (can you imagine a case where x1 is highly positively correlated with x2 and x3, but x2 and x3 are independent of each other?)  A tutorial page can explain the test to do and what to do if it fails, a function would tend to hide this important detail and send target users to the mailing list with questions about cryptic error messages.

I am happy to work on a tutorial page, and currently the wiki seems a logical place to put it.  I however have never wikied before (is that the proper verb :-), is there anyone out there who would be willing to help with that side of things?  Or propose a better alternative?
