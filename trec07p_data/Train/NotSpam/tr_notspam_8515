Getting an hello world to work is probably not very complicated, there
are even tutorials online.

What we need to do for pyxpcom to be actually useful is to bridge it to
gtkmozembed. In particular we need to be able to access nsIWebBrowser,
which gtkmozembed exposes, as a python object. Someone in the epiphany
team might be able to give some guidance on this too.
