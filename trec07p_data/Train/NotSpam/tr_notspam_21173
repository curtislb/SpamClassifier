Matt,

I don't know if you have reviewed the Sweave manual, but section 3.4
provides insight into reusing named code chunks, as an alternative to
looping or creating LaTeX macros as proposed by Dieter. These can be
"nested" within other named code chunks and/or R code.

If you don't yet have the manual, it is available here from Fritz' site:

http://www.ci.tuwien.ac.at/~leisch/Sweave/Sweave-manual-20060104.pdf

You could consider using a figure chunk, if the sole output is the plot
and not text. That way you don't have to worry about explicitly cat()ing
the figure related LaTeX markup as you are doing above. Thus, the LaTeX
markup for things like captions will be in LaTeX sections of the .Rnw
file and you can use \Sexpr{}'s to include derived scalar values.

The preferred approach may be to an extent dependent upon whether your
final document will simply have several plots on one or more pages in
sequence, or whether you will need to have text between the plots, such
that you really need LaTeX sections between the figure/code chunks.

Back to Dieter's solution for a moment, take note of the Sweave FAQ
(also in the above manual), specifically FAQ A.9, which covers the issue
of figure chunks and multiple plots, proposing a looping approach
consistent with Dieter's.

I hope that this might give you some other insights into alternative
approaches.

HTH,

Marc Schwartz
