My experience with a USA19X USB to serial converter argues otherwise.  I 
hooked a Power Braille 80 to one, and configured Brltty to use it.  Things 
were always very unstable.  Brltty would routinely lose communications 
with the Braille display, and thus, it would go dead for several seconds 
at a time, then come back resulting in error messages on the console. 
This was especially bad when there was a lot of data being sent to the 
display.  So, I now have the Braille display on a PCI serial card, the 
Dectalk USB in serial mode on the one internal serial port, and my UPS on 
the USB-to-serial converter.  This works quite well for me since the UPS 
sends no data, just changes one line when the power goes out, and another 
when the battery is about to die.
