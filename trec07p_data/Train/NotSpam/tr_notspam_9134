I think you're asking a design question about a Monte Carlo simulation.  You
have a "population" (size 10,000) from which you're defining an empirical
distribution, and you're sampling from this to create pairs of training and
test samples.

You need to ensure that each specific pair of training and test samples is
disjoint, meaning no observations in common.  Normally, you wouldn't want to
make the different training samples disjoint, if that's what you meant by
them being "unique".  Or were you using it to mean "identical"?
