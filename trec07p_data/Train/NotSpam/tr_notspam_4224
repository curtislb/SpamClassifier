I think that is how it currently works. A derivative work is a work  
that would attract its own copyright. So having derivation as the  
copyleft trigger fits copyright law perfectly.

There seem to be two major cases where this does not fit people's  
expectations: the use of a piece of music in a film soundtrack and the  
use of a photograph as a magazine illustration. The former has been  
worked into the CC licenses as a special case where copyleft is  
triggered by something other than derivation, the latter has not.

So I don't think that we can say that the licenses should only concern  
themselves with how copyright law works; there are already examples of  
where they do not do this (NC is another).

- Rob.
