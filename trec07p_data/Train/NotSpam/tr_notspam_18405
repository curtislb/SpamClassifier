Is your point that it is impossible to clearly define, or do you have 
alternative language?

Do you know how the corresponding clause in the current Affero license 
has historically been interpreted?

It's not that bad. If I turn some AGPLed code into a local 
graphics-editing application which has no network capabilities, it's 
fairly clear that it doesn't apply.

But then, what happens if I access that desktop using remote X? Hmm...

Let's say the clause instead said that anyone who interacts with the 
work had to get access to the corresponding source, full stop (no 
network need be involved). Would that be less ambiguous, I wonder?

I don't understand this argument. Having to provide CDs of source or 
fulfil the terms of a written offer is also a significant cost, but 
no-one thinks that makes the GPL non-free.

What does it prevent you using the Program for?

Well, it forbids public use of the modified version on a publicly 
accessible server. :-) But of course it does - that's the point. But 
then the GPL forbids giving someone the use of the modified version via 
giving them a copy without handing them the source code at the same 
time. That's not a use restriction.

The AGPL clearly passes the Desert Island test (and the Tentacles of 
Evil test). I'm not sure the current wording of the Dissident test had 
this situation in mind, but I think a good argument could be made that 
it passes.

(Incidentally, what part of the DFSG is the Dissident test supposed to 
help test against?)
