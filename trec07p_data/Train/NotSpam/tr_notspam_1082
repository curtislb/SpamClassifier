What does "each interactive interface" mean? I.e., what delimiters an  
interface?
Does a program with more than one window have more than one interface?
What if it is a web application with several clients? That each open  
different
windows? (This is not specified in the GPLv3 draft either, but I don't  
think
it is at all obvious.)


Anyway, consider this case:

  Program A has a graphical user interface with an "about" feature showing  
legal
  notices. It also has some very clever algorithms in its belly.

  Program B wants to use the algorithms, but cares not for the interface of  
program A.

  Program B has an interactive textual user interface.
  (Can the *feature* be preserved when going from graphical to textual?)

  Program B extracts the algorithms and uses them, but dumps the interface.
  Should Program B preserve the legal notices? Obviously yes.

  Now the people at Program B Software first extract the clever algorithms
  and distributes them, alone, under the original license, as allowed by  
the GPL.
  Then they use *this* distribution in program B. The program they use has  
no interactive
  user interface at all, and no feature displaying legal notices, so  
program B isn't
  required to have it either.

This problem is inherent to linking a requirement relating to an entire  
program
to only parts of that program (here: the user interface). Anybody can  
remove those
parts and distribute the rest, thereby removing the requirement.

Your version does alleviate this problem. Clause 5d of GPLv3draft3, as you  
quoted it,
does. It requires that legal notices be inserted if deriving form a program
with no user interface (but not from one with a user interface but without
legal notices). It's not necessarily the same notices as the original  
program, though,
just the default GPL notices.
