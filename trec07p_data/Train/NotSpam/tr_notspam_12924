time apart. They went to prom together, modeled together, and when it came =
time for their weddings, they had a double ceremony. The two couples made h=
omes for themselves next door to one another, so they would never be far fr=
om each other's sides. When Hurricane Isabel struck, a 70-ft tree fell on R=

g? Gabi Redford, features editor for AARP The Magazine, will join us with a=
dvice.=20

WILLIAMS SONOMA: MEMORIAL DAY PICNIC: It's that time of year! Memorial Day =
weekend. And for many, that means firing up the backyard barbeque and grill=
ing up a feat for friends and family. But if grilling under the hot sun doe=
sn't strike your fancy, you can have just as much fun with a festive holida=
y picnic. Instead of packing the usual sandwiches and potato salad for a Me=
