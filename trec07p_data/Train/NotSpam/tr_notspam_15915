Have you had a chance to look at pNFS (which is in the NFSv4.1 spec.)?

A few years ago, Peter proposed a complimentary pCIFS which would allow
clients direct access to the block storage.  Metadata management would be
handled via CIFS but the clients, once they held an appropriate lock, would
do direct block I/O (via iSCSI, Fibre Channel, or other methods).

I was speaking with folks from Panasas a couple of weeks ago.  Garth gave a
pNFS presentation and afterwards we started talking about the flexibility of
the Linux implementation of pNFS, and the possibility that the client-side
code could also be used to support pCIFS functionality.  The Panasas folks
sounded interested, but I think they'd want to know more about the
possibility of follow-through from both Samba and the Linux CIFS VFS client.

So back to my question:  When Ronnie talks about pCIFS which pCIFS is that
and what is it intended to do?  Do we have a collision in the name space or
is someone (not unusually) way ahead of me?

I will take a look.

Thanks.
