Dear list,

Could anybody guide me as to obtaining and releasing interviewee footage
under Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution
Licence(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ )
?

Is it even possible to do this?  Is there a release form in existence that =
I
could use, for interviewees to sign, that broadcasters would be able to
accept from any projects using any of the footage?  Are there any projects
out there doing this already - with this license?

Im british and my first desire would be for the footage to be able pass
British broadcasters legal obligations however a global passing=B4, or as m=
uch
of one as possible, would of course be much more desirable.

Any answers, advice or referals would be greatly appreciated.

Many Thanks,
Peter O=B4Brien
