Aye.

Only the Class and Object PMCs need this header file. Nothing else 
should include it. It's part of my attempt to encourage encapsulation. I 
was following the precedent that src/ contains some .h files (I guess, 
for a similar reason). I'm pretty sure I've seen .h files show up in 
languages PMC directories too.

The fact that you've pointed out its unusual for a .h file to be there 
is perhaps a good thing, 'cus anyone thinking of including it themselves 
will hopefully think the same. ;-) If anyone feels really strongly 
otherwise, I won't be bothered if it gets moved.
