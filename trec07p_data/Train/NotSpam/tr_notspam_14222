@ is for entire arrays.  $ is for single elements.  How is that
confusing?

Your method relies on the programmer being consistent.  Perl's built-
in method is inforced via the compiler.  Your method relies on all
programmers who will ever read or modify your code following the same
convention.

You're right, it's actually worse than pointless, since it's not
enforceable nor guaranteed, and therefore creates a false sense of
security.
