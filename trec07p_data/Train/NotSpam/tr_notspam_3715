India: Patently Wrong

Roger Bate
April 19, 2007
Tech Central Station

While many Indians are still upset by their countrymen's premature
departure from the Cricket World Cup, those interested in Indian
prosperity should be even more upset by the equally recent departure of
the head of a technical committee designed to analyse India's patent
law. With the resignation of R.A Mashelkar, due to politically motivated
personal attacks, the Indian Government has lost a firm defender of
intellectual property, which is a key means for increased growth and
prosperity for India.

Dr. Mashelkar is both a respected scientist and administrator and his
committee was formed to review the 2005 Indian Patent Amendment Act. But
from the moment the committee's report was published, and Mashelkar
spoke favourably about patents, he has been cast as a villain by leftist
activists.

Critics have jumped on mistakes that were made in the drafting of the
report. The most damaging to Dr. Mashelkar was that certain sections of
the report's recommendations were directly taken from one of the studies
submitted to the committee during its deliberations. Dr. Mashelkar
immediately apologised to the author whose work was incorporated without
due acknowledgement. He also requested that the government withdraw the
report and he offered to re-write it. But the damage was done. Under
pressure by media and activists, the Indian government forced Dr.
Mashelkar to resign. With his departure, perhaps the best hope for
India's increasing competitiveness in the pharmaceutical sector is gone.

Indian protectionist interests have historically prevented global
competition and innovation in drug manufacturing. Yet in 1995 India
signed on to the World Trade Organization's agreement and was given
until January 2005 for product patents to be in place. With the new
Indian patent law of 2005, protection for innovation seemed assured. But
after lobbying from local producers, amendments were made to the law,
which are unique to India and in my opinion illegal under the WTO
agreement. It is these amendments that Dr. Mashelkar's committee was
asked to review.

What is depressing for India watchers is that activist efforts are
short-sighted and unfair both to Indian scientists who are more than
capable of competing globally, and to Indian consumers who will not
receive the best drugs under the current law.

The key amendment to the patent law, Section 3(d), creates additional
hurdles for pharmaceutical patents by deeming that derivatives of known
substances are not considered patentable unless they can be shown to
differ in terms of efficacy. One has to demonstrate more than the usual
"novelty, commercial applicability and non-obviousness" criteria under
the WTO agreement.

Applying only to drug development, this amendment violates the WTO
agreement because the agreement disallows WTO member states from
rendering it more difficult to obtain a patent in one technical field
over another.

The first impact of this amendment came when drug company Novartis'
application for a patent for its cancer drug Gleevec was rejected.
Novartis brought an action in the Chennai High Court (the case is still
ongoing) claiming that it should have been granted a patent. Indeed,
most physicians and patients would agree that the Novartis drug Gleevec
represents an innovative anti-cancer breakthrough and deserves a patent.
In 1983, Novartis scientist Dr. Alex Matter led the charge for a new
drug that would target only cancer cells. As greater genomic knowledge
became available, Novartis scientists ultimately were successful,
resulting in Gleevec.

First patented in 1994 in Taiwan and then in 1996 in America, Gleevec
was first used on leukemia patients in 2001.

Novartis continued to work on the drug, developing another, beta
crystal, version. That is the one for which it applied for a patent in
India. Ironically, had India had patent laws when Novartis first started
filing globally, the company probably would have received a patent. For
the Indian government denied Novartis a patent under Section 3(d),
claiming that the second version was not sufficiently distinct from the
first.

Even under Indian law today, Novartis arguably should qualify for a
patent. The beta version performs better in some tests, implying that it
is a clinical improvement over the older version, just what Section 3(d)
demands.

Far from Novartis keeping the poor from receiving needed drugs, it is
India's patent law that limits India's drug market. India's patent
hurdles discourage drug companies from operating there, undermine
innovation (as many drugs are developed from existing substances), and
put off drug companies from working on diseases that may be unique to India.

This case is one of principle. It will not affect Indian patients, for
Novartis distributes the drug free to most of those who need it. But if
Novartis loses the case, as insiders think is likely now that Mashelkar
has been discredited, it will send a signal to drug companies that India
is not welcoming. And even Indian drug company, Ranbaxy Laboratories,
which has historically copied western drugs, has come out in favor of
Novartis.

The stakes are high. About 70% of Indians do not receive modern
healthcare treatment, many buy sub-standard drugs and perhaps half of
those drugs are counterfeits. No doctor in public sector healthcare can
credibly claim that patients' problems are related to patents. But
rather than looking into the whole chain of delivery--medical
professionals, diagnostic facilities, dispensaries and hospitals--it is
easier to wave the national flag, and claim that western drug companies
are at fault. The reality is that even if there were no patents, or if
medicines were distributed free, many patients would still not benefit.
Nothing else can explain the failure to provide oral rehydration therapy
to diarrhoea patients, or the failure to vaccinate children against polio.

India is at a crossroads. It can follow the route it has taken in
software engineering, with sensible intellectual property protection
that spurs growth, or it can travel the opposite route with
idiosyncratic rules that limit growth and innovation.

If Novartis loses the case in the next week or so, the Government can
still intervene to change the law-it should do so.
