You installed linux on your Dad's computer w/o permission?  No wonder he got 
pissed off.  I would too and I like linux.

Other people have suggested building a dual boot system and that's probably 
fine. But I think you should get your own computer. If you're running 
speakup, you can get by with a 1 Ghz machine or even less if you have a 
hardware synth.  Join a linux users group in your  area. Those nerds will be 
able to help you assemble a system for practically nothing. If you get 4 or 
5 linux nerds together in one place, they can assemble a machine out of 
spare parts in nothing flat.
