In the BIOS settings, there should be four settings, one master and
one slave for each controller. If your BIOS allows for an AUTO 
setting try that and it should auto-detect the drives. On most of the
older BIOS there was an auto detect function you could invoke 
by pressing a key like F8 or similar and it would detect the drives
and set the BIOS properly, newer BIOS can auto-detect at boot
time. If you know which slave slot is for CD and if there is a CD 
setting in the BIOS, use that setting, and check to make sure the
CD drive is jumpered as slave.

If drives are not showing up then usually they are either not 
jumpered correctly or the BIOS setting is not correct. There are
two other possible pains with old BIOS, one is limitation of 
drive size, some older BIOS may not support the full capacity.
Some drives have a special jumper setting for this which will 
limit the drive size for older BIOS. And in some rare cases 
you need to manually set the capacity, number of cylinders 
and tracks, although its becoming rare that you'd have to do
that anymore.

The most important thing is making sure the drives are 
jumpered correctly as one master and one slave on each 
cable and making sure the drive is enabled in BIOS, if
there is an auto setting in BIOS try that, if the drive is 
still not working, the drive will be labeled with info for 
cylinder/track/capacity and you can set them manually.
Hopefully you will not need to do this.
