 I understand entirely how both features work.  I should, as I implemented
large sections of the code dealing with vtable overriding.  Perhaps you
should check the code, because they are *not* stored separately from each
other.  In the current revision, :vtable and :method used together stores
the sub as a vtable entry and as a visible method.  Adding :anon detaches it
from the namespace.  For the new PDD15 implementation, once #42406 and
#42407 are committed, I plan to rework how they're stored internally, but
that isn't relevant to our discussion of the interface.

In my previous posts, I was talking about what you proposed earlier, which I
won't go over here, because it's in your earlier post.  If I didn't make the
distinction clear, I apologize.
