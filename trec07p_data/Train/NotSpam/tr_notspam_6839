What the education of the two apples of my eye has to do with looted art 

Struggling for a money bleeding year in the UK High Court not to ?accept?
geese-feed that the earth is flat and the Abou Bros are not criminals and
have no tarnished reputation, it seems not to matter that Hicham Aboutaam
was convicted in the US for smuggling and falsifying provenance documents,
it does not matter that Ali Aboutaam is a fugitive of the Egyptian law and
has fifteen years of prison waiting for him for conspiracy, money laundering
and smuggling, it does not matter that I have recordings with the Abou
lawyer Roberty in which with crystal-clarity is stated that he stopped his
clients from having me killed, it does not matter that I was falsely accused
by the Aboutaams of blackmail and incarcerated under Napoleonic law in
Switzerland until I saw a Judge some days later, was set free on the spot
but almost lost custody over my two boys, it does not matter that the
Cleveland Museum is ordered to hand over the Aboucadabra looted Praxiteles,
their prized possession, by the Italian authorities, it does not matter that
the Boston -, Getty -, Kimbell -, Princeton -, Metropolitan museum all had
and have to hand over looted Aboucadabra artworks, it does not matter that
trusting private collectors are targeted by the Greek and Italian
authorities for looted Aboucadabra works.

As a matter of fact, it does not matter at all that the Abou Bros are
presently the epicentre and being held responsible by the Italian-,
Egyptian- and Greek authorities as being the major criminal players in the
shadowy world of looted antiquities. 

 

What really matters is to destroy the fact that as a loving father and
surrogate mother at the same time I am trying to raise my two boys, my two
reasons to live, in the best way that I can, abstain from whatever smells of
luxury myself to be able to pay for their education and that such amorality
needs to be singled out by the high paid shysters of the criminal Aboutaams
in a pathetic attempt to take this ?crime? away from them and me. 

Just have high paid ambulance chasers doing your dirty work by papering the
other party to death, delay the inexorable truth to come out, desperately
try to drain the opposition of funds and you are well on your way to
perverting the course of Justice. 

Nothing new in this for you, h? boys?

Well done Abous, you are living up to your highly esteemed reputation

    Nearly 100,000 Historical Sites Dot Saudi Landscape
P.K. Abdul Ghafour, Arab News
 

JEDDAH, 2 May 2007 ? Saudi Arabia is replete with archaeological sites 
dating back to thousands of years, according to Dr. Mohammed 
Al-Ruwaished, deputy minister of education for antiquities and museums.

?There are nearly 100,000 historical sites in the Kingdom and we have 
already identified and registered 3,700 main sites. Some of these have 
80 to 100 related sites in different localities,? Asharq Al-Awsat 
newspaper quoted Ruwaished as saying.

The deputy minister disclosed that the Kingdom retrieved 1,600 rare 
Islamic coins that were in the process of being smuggled out from the 
Shuaiba port recently. He commended the customs department for its role 
in preventing the smuggling of many valuable artifacts from the country.

Ruwaished said the Agency for Antiquities and Museums, which is under 
the Ministry of Education, would be merged with the Supreme Commission 
for Tourism (SCT) in two months. The SCT wants to make use of the 
Kingdom?s museums and historical sites to promote tourism.

Prince Sultan ibn Salman, secretary-general of the SCT, has highlighted 
Saudi Arabia?s tourism prospects in the heritage sector.

?We have a large tourism market, especially in the areas of heritage and 
culture. Saudi Arabia is a first-class heritage state as there are 
thousands of antiquities and we have unearthed only a limited number of 
them. The Kingdom?s geographical position has made it a crossroads of 
civilizations,? Sultan said.

Ruwaished said his ministry has licensed 19 museums across the country, 
adding that 11 of them had received approval from the Higher Council for 
Antiquities.

Two new museums have been opened in Baha and Hail as part of a national 
plan to set up a museum in each of the Kingdom?s 13 regions. In addition 
to the National Museum in Riyadh, several historical buildings have been 
renovated and converted into museums in Jeddah, Taif, Hofuf and other areas.

The Kingdom?s historical sites and museums will attract a large number 
of foreign tourists. The SCT chief has said that Saudi Arabia wants to 
attract 1.5 million tourists a year by 2020, excluding the millions who 
come on Haj and Umrah pilgrimages. He spoke of the ambitious goal of 
making tourism to account for 18 percent of the country?s gross domestic 
product by 2020.

Ruwaished said the Kingdom had returned some stolen artifacts to their 
original foreign sources. ?The coordination with the Interior Ministry, 
the customs and other related agencies were instrumental in preventing 
smuggling of valuable artifacts and antiquities in and out of the 
country,? he pointed out.

Saudi Arabia is a signatory of an international agreement on protecting 
cultural properties,? Ruwaished said. ?We will not allow circulation of 
any antiques without permission from the country of its origin,? he said.

/May 01 2007/

SURREY

Surrey RCMP are looking into a series of art thefts ? a number of them 
from restaurants ? following at least five reports of nicked artwork 
since March 29.

The Peace Arch News reported on three thefts earlier this month, of 
prints on display at abc Country Restaurant (March 30), the Turkey House 
(April 10) and Aston Pacific Inn (sometime between March 30 and April 
2). The prints were part of a closed-bid Ducks Unlimited Canada fundraiser.

Friday, police confirmed artwork has also been reported stolen from abc 
Restaurants in Cloverdale (March 29 and April 11) and Fleetwood (April 19).

Lori McPhee?s Art-Concept Gallery, at 1 15531 24 Ave. was hit April 11.

?It was quite bold,? McPhee said.

McPhee said the suspect went so far as to help her hang a painting 
before making off with a $950 framed piece by South Surrey artist Pat 
Peacock.

The man made a dash with the painting when McPhee went to answer the phone.

?He just ran, grabbed the piece and ran out the door,? she said.

?I ran after him. He just threw the painting in the back (of a waiting 
vehicle).?

McPhee said it was the second time the studio was targeted. Thieves took 
three paintings worth a combined $2,000 about one month prior, she said.

Anyone with information on any of the thefts is asked to call police at 
604-599-0502.

Pictures stolen from antiques shop

Paintings valued at nearly ?8,000 were stolen from an antiques shop in 
Long Melford.
The two framed oil paintings were taken from Long Melford Antiques 
Centre, in Little St Mary's, at around 2.45am on Saturday, April 28.

The store was broken into via the roof and even though the burglars 
triggered the alarm, they still made off with the pictures.

The paintings are a pair, measuring 94x77cm (landscape) and are of 
battle scenes. They are very dark, possibly by a Russian artist and are 
in two-inch black wooden slightly patterned frames.

Anyone with information should contact Pc Niall Johnson at Sudbury 
Police Station on 01473 613500 or Crime Stoppers on 0800 555 111.

Heist or hoax?

Museum's prized sculpture swiped

By HEATHER SCOFIELD
Correspondent DELAND -- The sculpture recently placed in front of the 
Museum of Florida Art to commemorate its "Equus III" exhibit was a 
life-size likeness of a horse, of course.

Now it's gone -- stolen, or perhaps, horse-napped sometime after doors 
to the museum, located across U.S. 17-92 from Stetson University, were 
locked Friday night.

Museum manager Jennifer Coolidge hopes the theft was a prank and says 
there will be no questions asked if the horse soon reappears intact.

When Coolidge last saw the sculpture, it was bolted to its platform 
outside the museum.

But when facilities manager Mike Keiser came to work Saturday, the 
approximately 300-pound horse no longer guarded the museum building.

"I don't understand how this happened; it was bolted down," Coolidge 
said Monday as she pointed to the platform with a small portion of the 
horse's back hoof still attached. "They literally ripped it right off."

Keiser figured museum employees had brought the sparkling stallion 
inside for the weekend. He said he worked most of the day, then called 
Coolidge after growing suspicious that something wasn't right. Coolidge 
filed a theft report with DeLand police Saturday evening.

The horse was one of 53 commissioned in 2002 by the Marion (County) 
Cultural Alliance and was made using hundreds of pieces of broken CDs by 
artist Julie Valladares. It was at the Museum of Florida Art on a 
temporary loan from the alliance.

"We've never had a horse stolen before," said Denise McNeff, spokeswoman 
for the alliance. "We're really hoping it was some kind of prank and 
will show back up."

McNeff said the horse was part of a set of sculptures, by various 
artists, the alliance calls "The In-Motion Herd" and likely would have 
been auctioned to a collector this fall.

Sculptures in a similar set have been sold for $25,000 to $100,000 each 
-- money the non-profit organization has used to stay fiscally afloat.

Coolidge said the museum would not press charges if the piece turns up 
unharmed in the next day or two.

Marion Cultural Alliance Board Chairman Gerald Ergle said he leans 
toward offering a similar amnesty but needs to consult with the 
alliance's board members before making any commitments.

"We just want the piece back," Coolidge said.

Museum officials have notified DeLand police and agencies that 
specialize in locating stolen art, as well as online art brokers and 
auction sites like eBay. Stetson authorities are talking with students 
and sending out notices around the campus seeking any information about 
the heist.

Local police are also looking for the art. Valladares, the artist, has 
not yet been told of the theft, McNeff said, because everyone involved 
is hoping the piece will be returned before that becomes necessary.

    Shelby White in Center Court at the Met
    Collecting

BY KATE TAYLOR - Staff Reporter of the Sun
May 1, 2007
URL: http://www.nysun.com/article/53523

Shelby White, wearing a pale green suit and a slightly tense smile, 
welcomed a reporter to the Park Avenue offices of the Leon Levy 
Foundation for an interview about the antiquities collection that has 
made her famous. Choice pieces are now on view, amid 7,500 other works 
from institutional and private lenders and the museum's own collection, 
in the Metropolitan Museum of Art's new Greek and Roman Galleries. The 
central atrium of the galleries, which opened this month, is named for 
Ms. White and her late husband, Leon Levy, in recognition of a $20 
million gift they made to the museum.

Ms. White has rarely granted interviews about her collection. In 
November, Italy asked Ms. White to return more than 20 objects that it 
claims were looted from Italian soil, according to the New York Times. 
Two objects from the Levy-White collection that the Italians have sought 
in the past ? a Euphronios krater depicting Hercules slaying Cycnos and 
a krater attributed to the Eucharides Painter, which depicts Zeus and 
his cupbearer Ganymede ? are currently on view at the Met.

The Met has not been the only recipient of the couple's philanthropy: 
Through the years, they sponsored excavations in Ashkelon, Israel, 
established a fund at Harvard to support archaeological publications, 
and donated $200 million to start an ancient studies institute at New 
York University, which recently named its first director. In the 
interview with The New York Sun ? granted on the condition that her 
quotes had to be approved afterward by her and her spokesman, Fraser 
Seitel ? Ms. White shared her thoughts about the Met opening and 
questioned the arguments of the archaeologists who have criticized her.

Asked when she became aware that standards of due diligence in the 
antiquities world were changing, Ms. White responded that it was hard to 
say. "In the '90s, there was talk about provenance, but that meant 
different things" to different people, she said. "Even today, what is 
considered an acceptable provenance is unclear and changing."

In a study published in 2000 in the American Journal of Archaeology, the 
journal of the Archaeological Institute of America, the British 
archaeologists David Gill and Christopher Chippindale found that of the 
works displayed at the Met in the 1990 exhibition "Glories of the Past: 
Ancient Art From the Shelby White and Leon Levy Collection," 84% first 
surfaced after 1973. That was the year that the AIA adopted the 1970 
Unesco convention on preventing illicit trade in cultural property, and, 
at that point, Mr. Gill said in an e-mail, museums and collectors were 
on notice about the problem of looting in source countries.

Ms. White questioned the basis for using the Unesco convention as a 
benchmark of legality. Asked what date she would suggest as a cut-off 
for collectors or museums, she said she didn't really have an opinion. 
"You could choose a date today, but would that be appropriate in 30 
years? I don't know, I'm not a legal scholar."

The director of the Met, Philippe de Montebello, last year made a deal 
with Italy to return several disputed objects, including the Met's own 
Euphronios krater, in exchange for long-term loans of similar objects. 
But he seems to have done so reluctantly, and in his public comments, he 
has vigorously defended the right of museums to continue collecting 
antiquities. He emphasizes that museums make their collections available 
to many more people than governments do and that art is best seen as it 
is at the Met, in the context of many cultures. "We are a world museum 
with an international audience," he said last week, standing in the Leon 
Levy and Shelby White Court. "This is the patrimony of all of our visitors."

Some collectors and museum officials argue that if uncertain provenance 
had in recent decades kept them from purchasing works that were offered 
to them these objects would simply have been snatched up by other 
collectors, who had fewer moral qualms, and perhaps less interest in 
sharing their collections with the public.

The Princeton philosopher and author of "Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a 
World of Strangers," Kwame Anthony Appiah, said this is a valid concern 
as, he said, is the argument of archaeologists that buying unprovenanced 
objects encourages further looting. "These are both genuine 
considerations: disincentivizing further looting and protecting objects 
that have already been looted," he said. "It's hard to do both; it's a 
complicated trade-off."

Now that the market for looted or unprovenanced cultural property in 
America has largely disappeared, Mr. Appiah said, "we have to accept 
that a lot of this stuff ? say, in Iraq ? is just going to go into 
Middle Eastern collections, or Japanese collections, or collections in 
other places where they don't have these scruples."

Another collector of antiquities, Michael Steinhardt, who is a friend of 
Ms. White's and a proprietor of this newspaper, said he believes Ms. 
White has been singled out by the Italians for two reasons: So much of 
her collection is published, allowing the Italians to check it against 
evidence they have gathered in criminal investigations into antiquities 
dealers, and she and her husband have been such major philanthropists.

"She and her husband, Leon, have been generous to a fault to all sorts 
of institutions" involved in study of the ancient world, he said. 
"Therefore she is a ripe target. Those people who are pursuing her don't 
seek justice; they seek victory." He added: "Further, I would say, 
Shelby has stood alone, and was not as strongly defended as she should 
have been by those very institutions to whom she had been a too-generous 
donor."

Mr. Steinhardt himself lost a legal battle over a gold phiale from the 
fourth century B.C.E. ? a vessel used for pouring libations ? which he 
bought for $1.2 million from the dealer Robert Hecht, who is now on 
trial in Rome for antiquities trafficking, along with the former curator 
at the J. Paul Getty Museum, Marion True. Italy claimed that the phiale 
was illegally exported, and eventually won its return, after American 
Customs seized it from Mr. Steinhardt's home.

In Mr. Steinhardt's view, the disproportionate targeting by source 
countries of American collectors and museums "reflects the weak and 
inept policy of the American government." American museums, for the most 
part, are not government-owned, as, say, French, Italian, and British 
museums are. Mr. Steinhardt said: "It seems to me that [the source 
countries] go after that place whose government is weakest and doesn't 
have the courage to stand up for its citizens. The U.S. State Department 
and the U.S. cultural policy professionals have really, I think, done a 
great disservice to the cultural institutions in this country."

A spokeswoman for the State Department said in an e-mail message that 
the department had no role in the litigation of Mr. Steinhardt's case. 
"As a State Party to the 1970 UNESCO Convention ? it is the policy of 
the [U.S. Government] to assist countries that have a problem with 
looting and illicit trafficking of their cultural property," she 
continued. "The USG does not believe that the US should be a haven for 
looted or stolen artifacts from other countries." She also noted that 
current U.S. import restrictions "do permit the importation of the 
restricted antiquities if they carry valid documentation that 
demonstrates legitimate provenance" and that "[t]here are many 
documented collections in the world that can circulate without 
contributing to the contemporary looting of sites and from which U.S. 
institutions can continue to form collections."

Ms. White argued that the scrutiny of antiquities collectors has had 
unintended effects: "We thought it was very important to lend our 
objects, to publish and exhibit our collection," she said. "The 
unfortunate thing we're seeing now is that other collectors are not 
going to show their collections because they don't want problems. So 
you're seeing a lot more secrecy than 15 years ago."

***

Because the Levys have published their collection, the Italians have 
recently been able to learn quite a bit about it. According to the 
Times, the Italians have traced nine objects, including the Euphronios 
and the Eucharides kraters, to Giacomo Medici, a dealer who was 
convicted of antiquities trafficking by an Italian court in 2004. The 
Levys never bought directly from Medici, but, like other collectors and 
like museums including the Met and the J. Paul Getty Museum, they bought 
from dealers who did. In the Levys' case this particularly included the 
British dealer Robin Symes. (Asked about the Met's business with Symes, 
Mr. de Montebello said, "Every other museum around the world was buying 
from the same dealers.")

According to Peter Watson's "The Medici Conspiracy: The Illicit Journey 
of Looted Antiquities: From Italy's Tomb Raiders to the World's Greatest 
Museums," when the Italians raided Medici's warehouse in Switzerland, 
they found extensive records of his transactions, as well as thousands 
of photographs. The photographs often document a given object in several 
different states: first broken and covered with dirt, suggesting it was 
recently taken from the ground; then in various stages of restoration; 
then, in some cases, on display in a museum, with Medici standing by 
proudly. Some of the objects photographed in the initial, dirt-encrusted 
state are now in the Levy-White collection.

Asked if she was aware of Medici's role in the market and that Symes 
bought from him, Ms. White said, "I never met Giacomo Medici."

The Levys' generosity and the Met's displaying the objects in question 
arouse vigorous debates in the scholarly world. "Some people would say 
it's a problem because it's whitewashing the Levy-White name," a 
professor at DePaul University who specializes in law governing cultural 
property and a former president of the Archaeological Institute of 
America, Patricia Gerstenblith, said of the Met's putting the couple's 
names on a gallery. "It is certainly lending a major institutional 
backing to people who are widely known to have questions about their 
collection." The AIA has taken a strong stance against the acquisition 
of objects without known provenance prior to 1973. Its journal, the 
American Journal of Archaeology, refuses to publish the initial 
scholarly presentation of any object acquired by its owner after 1973, 
unless its existence is documented before that date or it was legally 
exported from its country of origin.

"It sends the clear message that the Metropolitan feels comfortable with 
the relationship of the Levy-Whites to illegal antiquities and to the 
continued destruction of archaeological sites in the Mediterranean 
world," a professor of anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania 
and the former director of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of 
Archaeology and Anthropology, Richard Leventhal, said.

Mr. Gill was more emphatic. "The Met is honoring two of the greatest 
collectors of looted antiquities from the late 20th century," he wrote 
in an e-mail message. "It would be like naming the Kenyan safari park 
after the poacher who had bagged the largest number of elephant tusks."

Read these comments, the Met spokesman, Harold Holzer, responded with 
indignation. "This image that her critics have created of Shelby White 
in a pith helmet destroying archeological sites is the most fantastic, 
ridiculous, really obscene misrepresentation that can be imagined," he 
said. "Shelby White and Leon Levy bought things in good faith from 
dealers and auction houses," he continued. "Unlike many collectors, 
they've consistently exhibited their work, published their collection, 
supported archeological research, and lent their work to museums to 
round out exhibitions or fill out gaps in collections ? putting their 
private works on public view for examination and scrutiny and study. 
They have been model collectors and museum benefactors."

The Levy-White publication fund at Harvard poses a quandary for 
scholars, because such funding is in short supply. Some classics and 
archaeology departments, including those at Bryn Mawr College and the 
University of Cincinnati, have adopted policies of not applying for or 
accepting money from the fund.

"We felt that, as admirable as it was for them to want to support 
archaeological publication, we didn't want to give our name and our 
reputation to them by accepting funds," the chairman of the classical 
and Near Eastern archaeology department at Bryn Mawr, James Wright, said.

The department does not have similar policies on working with the Met, 
or with the Cycladic Art Foundation, of which Ms. White is the 
chairwoman. Students regularly do summer internships with the 
foundation's Cycladic Art Museum in Greece, and Mr. Wright said he 
frequently writes recommendations for his students to intern at the Met. 
Several alumni of the department work at the Met, including the chief 
curator of Greek and Roman art, Carlos Pic?n.

"We're not such Puritans," Mr. Wright said. The Met's collection, he 
said, is "a tremendous resource," and the department would never 
discourage students from working with it or with the Getty's collection. 
"What we do require is that our students abide by ethics code of the 
AIA," he said. But, he added, "especially in this day and age, when so 
many students are interested in museum careers, we do what we can to 
promote them, and we simply make them aware of the ethical issues, and 
then they can decide for themselves."

The Getty recently adopted a new policy: The museum will not acquire an 
object unless there is documentation of its having been in America 
before 1970; its having been out of its original country before 1970, 
and legally imported into America, or its having been legally exported 
from its original country and legally imported into America after 1970. 
Mr. de Montebello has implied that the Met will not follow the Getty's 
lead. In a lecture last fall on the history of antiquities collecting, 
he showed a slide of a beautiful classical torso and said: "Frankly, the 
refusal to acquire and thus bring into the public domain such a 
masterpiece simply as a matter of principle or ideology ? is 
unacceptable." If a museum declined such a sculpture, he warned, "it 
would be driven underground ? and I do not mean, by some miracle, to the 
place from which it came."

While Ms. White is being honored in New York, the Italians and Greeks 
appear to be deciding whether to charge Symes, a dealer from whom she 
bought frequently through the years, with antiquities trafficking. In 
"The Medici Conspiracy," Mr. Watson reports that the Italian 
investigators who searched Medici's warehouse found documentation of a 
close business relationship between Medici and Symes; for some period, 
the two even shared an administrative address in Geneva. And Mr. Watson 
said in an interview that the Italian prosecutor, Paolo Ferri, has said 
repeatedly that he intends to charge Symes.

A lawyer who is pursuing Symes in an unrelated case and is also the 
London counsel for the Getty, Ludovic de Walden said: "Symes is next on 
the [Italians'] list. That's what I've been told."

Asked in an e-mail message whether he plans to charge Symes, Mr. Ferri 
replied that it would be premature to comment on his intentions.

Last April, the Greek police raided a villa on the island of Schinoussa, 
in the Cyclades, that used to belong to Symes and his partner, Christo 
Michaelides, and now belongs to Christo's sister, Despina Papadimitriou, 
and her children. In an e-mail, the head of the section of the police 
that handles antiquities smuggling, George Gligoris, confirmed that he 
has been conducting an investigation of Symes, focused particularly on a 
marble torso of a young woman that, according to the Los Angeles Times, 
Symes sold to the Getty for $3.3 million.

For many years, Symes and Michaelides shared a globe-trotting lifestyle. 
In addition to the villa on Schinoussa, they owned a Philip 
Johnson-designed townhouse in New York filled with art nouveau furniture 
and a house in London with an indoor pool surrounded by ancient busts. 
They drove a Rolls-Royce and a Bentley. In 1999, however, Michaelides 
died in a freak accident. Part-way through a dinner given by the Levys 
at a home they had rented in Tuscany, he got up from the table and 
disappeared. Later, he was discovered, having fallen down some steps and 
hit his head against a portable radiator. He died in a hospital the next 
day.

Michaelides was from a wealthy Greek family, and his sister Despina had 
married into an even wealthier one. At several points, she had provided 
loan guarantees or cash for Symes and Michaelides's antiquities 
business. In the wake of Michaelides's death, she and the rest of his 
family believed that they had inherited his half of the dealership. 
Symes disagreed. At first, he claimed that Michaelides was not his 
business partner, but merely an employee. Later, he changed his 
argument, asserting that because they were life partners, like a husband 
and wife, he had inherited all of Michaelides's assets, including his 
half of the business and the villa on Schinoussa. (Symes simultaneously 
maintains that although he and Michaelides lived together for three 
decades and were accepted by all of their friends as a couple, their 
relationship was platonic.)

The dispute landed in court, and the ensuing legal battle revealed a 
good deal about Symes's business practices. Because the Papadimitrious 
believed that Symes was not disclosing all his inventory, they hired 
detectives to trail him all over the world. With the help of their 
legwork, Mr. Watson says, the Papadimitrious' lawyer, Mr. de Walden, 
discovered that Symes was storing his inventory at 33 different sites.

At this point, Symes was supposed to be conducting business only with 
permission of the court, but Mr. de Walden discovered he had lied about 
two major sales, saying he had sold an Egyptian statue for only $1.6 
million, when he sold it for $4.5 million, and that he sold some Eileen 
Gray furniture for $4 million, when in fact it was $14 million. The 
British judge, Justice Peter Smith, charged him with contempt of court 
and handed him a two-year prison sentence, of which he served eight 
months. About the same time, Symes went bankrupt, and Levy ? who, 
according to Mr. Watson, was supporting him financially ? died.

The Greek raid on Schinoussa led to a new twist in the 
Symes-Papadimitriou case. The police found more than 100 undeclared 
antiquities in the villa, in addition to photographs that Mr. Gligoris 
is now using in his investigation.

At the time of the raid, Despina Papadimitriou said she inherited the 
objects from her brother and that she would cooperate in the 
investigation. But, in November, a Greek prosecutor charged her and her 
three children with illegal possession of antiquities. Mr. Watson 
suggested to the Sun that this may be a tactical move to pressure the 
family to collaborate further in gathering evidence against Symes.

***

Ms. White described what has befallen Symes as "a great tragedy." She 
said, "He lost his lifetime partner. He has suffered tremendous 
financial and health problems."

Several messages left on Symes's cell phone, as well as ones passed 
through his agents in bankruptcy and a dealer he stayed with 
temporarily, went unreturned. At one point, someone answered Symes's 
cell phone but, when a reporter identified herself, said that Symes was 
out of the country. Asked who he was, he gave his name only as Peter.

Ms. White declined to comment on her negotiations with the Italians, 
except to say they are "amicable." Until this point Ms. White has 
defended her and her husband's buying practices with the fierceness and 
the pertinacity of a Roman general, but the negotiations may end with 
her conceding at least some of the requested objects.

"Have standards of collecting changed?" she said. "Of course. Nobody 
wants to buy something ripped off the wall."

    Kunstraub bei Makler

*Angeklagter bestreitet Beteiligung an Gewalttat.

*Die Kidnapper hatten offenbar einen Tipp bekommen. ?Sie schienen zu 
wissen, dass die Wohnung gesichert ist?, erinnerte sich ihr Opfer im 
Prozess. F?nf Monate ist es her, dass der Immobilienmakler und Jurist 
Ottmar N. vor seinem Haus in einen wei?en Transporter gezerrt, 
misshandelt und beraubt wurde. Einer der mutma?lichen T?ter, ein 
38-j?hriger Litauer, muss sich vor dem Landgericht verantworten.

Bei der Kurzentf?hrung ging es den Gangstern um schnelle Beute. Sie 
wollten Zugang zur Wohnung, um Bargeld oder Wertgegenst?nde zu rauben. 
Sie verschwanden mit drei Kunstwerken aus der Sammlung ihres 48-j?hrigen 
Opfers sowie vier hochwertigen Uhren. Der Schaden wurde auf 200 000 Euro 
gesch?tzt. Das Gem?lde ?Rot-Gelb-Blau? von Gerhard Richter, ein Gem?lde 
von Hans Hartung und die Collage ?Wrapped Reichstag? von Christo sind 
bis heute verschwunden. Ob der Angeklagte Karolis N. einer der T?ter 
war, kann der Makler nicht sagen. Als er an jenem Abend im November 
letzten Jahres in der N?he seiner Dahlemer Wohnung gerade eingeparkt 
hatte, seien zwei Vermummte aus einem wei?en Kastenwagen gesprungen. 
?Sie zerrten mich in ihr Fahrzeug, fesselten mich.? Nach einem 
Faustschlag habe er den Zutrittscode zu seinem Haus preisgegeben. Einer 
der T?ter sei daraufhin f?r etwa eineinhalb Stunden verschwunden. Dann 
habe man ihn zu einem Kellereingang gebracht und dort mit Klebeband an 
ein Gel?nder gefesselt, schilderte das Opfer.

Der Kunstsammler vermutete zun?chst, dass ein Gesch?ftspartner hinter 
dem ?berfall stecken k?nnte. Doch dann brachte sein ebenfalls aus 
Litauen stammender Lebensgef?hrte den Namen von Karolis N. als m?glichem 
T?ter ins Spiel. Neben Zeugenaussagen soll auch eine in der Wohnung des 
Opfers sichergestellte Spur gegen den gelernten Schuhmacher sprechen. 
Vor Gericht hat der Litauer ?ber seine Verteidigerin nur so viel 
mitgeteilt: Er bestreite die Vorw?rfe. Der Prozess wird Montag 
fortgesetzt. K.G.

  Egypt will request loan of artifacts

 From the Associated Press

May 1, 2007

Egypt plans to seek the temporary return of some of its most precious 
artifacts from museums abroad, including the Rosetta Stone and a bust of 
Nefertiti.

The country's chief archeologist, Zahi Hawass, said the Foreign Ministry 
would send letters this week requesting that the ancient artifacts be 
loaned to Egypt.

Hawass has previously demanded the permanent return of many of the 
artifacts, claiming some of them were taken illegally.

This time, the country is requesting museums loan the artifacts so they 
can be exhibited either at the 2011 opening of the Egyptian Museum, near 
the site of the Great Pyramids at Giza, or the Atum museum, which is set 
to open in the Nile Delta city of Meniya in 2010, the Supreme Council of 
Antiquities said in a statement.

Egypt said it would request the loans from the British Museum, Paris' 
Louvre, Boston's Museum of Fine Arts and two German museums.

The Rosetta Stone, a 1,680-pound slab of black basalt with a triple 
inscription, was the key to deciphering ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics. 
It is one of the centerpieces of the British Museum.

"We have never received a written request to loan the Rosetta Stone," 
British Museum spokeswoman Hannah Boulton said. "If one was put in, we 
would consider it."
