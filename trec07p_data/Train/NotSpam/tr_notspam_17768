If it's possible to do so, yes. If not, then indicate that the number
of contributors is so large that it's not practicable to include them
all and that people should look at the source to see.
 
[The main reason why people should go through all of the contributors
is so that they check that files under incorrect licences haven't
suddenly snuck in.]

Miracles had become relative common-places since the advent of
entheogens; it now took very unusual circumstances to attract public
attention to sightings of supernatural entities. The latest miracle
had raised the ante on the supernatural: the Virgin Mary had
manifested herself to two children, a dog, and a Public Telepresence
Point.
