Which means he doesnt want his software to be packaged or he wouldnt do
such a braindead thing, so best is to not waste time on it for a

4. If you are using the Program in someone else's bedroom at any Monday
3:05 PM, you are not allowed to modify the Program for ten
minutes. [This clause provided by Inphernic; every licence should
contain at least one clause, the reasoning behind which is far from
obvious.]
