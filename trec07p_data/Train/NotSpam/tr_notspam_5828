Radon360 writes "Kodak has decided to attempt to [0]buck the trend set by
HP by offering low cost printers and reasonably priced ink cartridges.
Three of their new printers start at $149, with ink cartridges costing
$9.99 for a black cartridge and $14.99 for a five color cartridge. To
counter, HP has announced a release of lower-priced cartridges, though
with less ink and they are still more expensive than Kodak's. It will be
a matter of time to see whether Kodak can upset the practice of ink
cartridge extortion."

directive excludes end-users from the law it will still criminalize sites

Apple's solid earnings yesterday comes above-expectation reporting from
Microsoft. Profits jumped 65% from the previous year, and sales of its

billion in Windows Vista revenue to the third quarter, to account for
upgrade coupons given to PC buyers during the holiday season before the
consumer launch of the new operating system. Excluding this figure,
client revenue totaled $4.1 billion, 30 percent higher than last year.'
Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said [2]Vista beat
internal forecasts by $300 million to $400 million, and Office 2007 sales
were $200 million better than expected."

telecom service providers BSNL and MTNL. While consumers would cheer, the
move holds the potential to kill the telecom business as we know it.' The

conclusion are unusual for this type of review because it straddles the
fence. The verdict is: 'a tie, but only because both platforms fall short
in some ways. Vista's roster of backup features aren't available in every
SKU of the product; Ubuntu doesn't have anything like Vista's shadow copy
system and its user-friendly backup tools are pretty rudimentary.'"

the federal Cable Communications Policy Act [2]does not apply to the
RIAA's attempts to get subscriber information (pdf) from cable companies.
Just to clarify, ex parte means that the application was secret, no one
else — neither the ISP nor the subscribers — were given notice that this
was going on. They were, in effect, asking the Court to rule that the
RIAA does not need to get a court order to be able to force an ISP to
disclose confidential subscriber information. The Magistrate Judge
[3]declined to rule on the issue (pdf), but did give them the ex parte
discovery order they were looking for."

armb writes with a link to a Wired Blog entry about [0]irregularities
found in Diebold databases from the state of Ohio. The election in
question here is November 2006, and the corruption of the entries may
raise doubts about accurate tabulations. "Vote totals in two separate
databases that should have been identical had different totals. Although
Diebold explained that this was part of the system design for separate
vote tables to get updated at different times during the tabulation
process, the team questioned the wisdom of a design that creates
non-identical vote totals. Tables in the database contained elements that
were missing date and time stamps that would indicate when information
was entered. Entries that did have date/time stamps showed a January 1,
1970 date. The database is built from Microsoft's Jet database engine.
The engine, according to Microsoft, is vulnerable to corruption when a
lot of concurrent activity is happening with the database, such as what
occurs on an election night when results are uploaded and various servers
are interacting with the database simultaneously."

An anonymous reader writes "Sun Microsystems appears to be shifting its
focus back to research, after several years of promoting its commodity
servers and Java software. Earlier this week, it talked about its new
[0]Andy Bechtolsheim-designed video server in the New York Times.
Yesterday, it invited reporters in to [1]preview its plans to develop
faster switches, new programming languages, and 3-D virtual workplaces.
Robert Sproull, director of Sun Labs, made clear that Sun has big
ambitions. 'General purpose computers have to be rethought,' he said.
Among the projects close to leaving the labs is Project Crossbow, an
evolution of the networking stack in Solaris; Project Sedna, a next
generation switch for storage-area networks; and MPK20, a virtual
workspace built on top of Sun's Darkstar gaming server."

[0]radioweather writes "A couple of weeks ago, there was a nutty idea
discussed in The Independent that claimed the [1]electromagnetic
radiation from cell phones was causing bees to become disoriented,
preventing them from returning to the hive. The flimsy cell phone
argument was used to explain Colony Collapse Disorder. Today the LA Times
reports that researchers at UC San Francisco have [2]uncovered what they
believe to be the real culprit: a parasitic fungus. Other researchers
said Wednesday that they too had found the fungus, a single-celled
parasite called Nosema ceranae, in affected hives from around the
country."

Scada Moosh writes "ZDNet has a story about the lessons Microsoft learned
from [0]the recent animated cursor (.ani) attacks and some of [1]the
broad changes being made to flag this type of vulnerability ahead of
time. The changes include a possible addition to the list of banned API
function calls, more aggressive checks for buffer overruns and
enhancements to existing fuzz testing tools. '[Michael] Howard said
Microsoft will "rethink the heuristics" used by the /GS compiler to flag
certain issues. "Changing the compiler is a long-term task. In the
short-term, we have a new compiler pragma that forces the compiler to be
much more aggressive, and we will start using this pragma on new code,"
he added. Two other Windows Vista security mechanisms -- ASLR and SafeSEH
-- were also in place to catch code failures but, in the case of the .ani
bug, Howard said the attackers were able to wrap vulnerable code in an
exception handler to find ways around those mitigations.'"

][nTrUdEr writes "The Economist has posted an editorial on [0]how DRM has
gone wrong. What ostensibly began as a tool to ensure artists received
due compensation for their work has been turned, and now criminalizes the
consumer for wanting to use what they have purchased. 'Despite the number
of iTunes downloaded for a fee, Apple would be in trouble if people were
prevented from transferring legitimately owned CDs to their iPods. The
software Apple gives away to iPod customers is designed to let them do
just that. Most people think it ludicrous that they can't do the same
with the DVDs they own. Now it seems, despite squeals from the movie
industry, the law is finally moving in the video fan's favour. The issue
in the recent case was whether Kaleidescape, a maker of digital
"jukeboxes" that store a person's video and music collections and
distribute the entertainment around the home, had breached the terms of
the DVD Content Control Association's CSS (content scrambling system)
license.'"

SpeedyTrain writes with a link to a story on the Mainichi Daily News site
about [0]the future of mass transit in Japan. Despite problems with
Maglev technology in test-bed scenarios around the world, Japan has
committed to building a line between Tokyo and Nagoya by 2025. The
experimental system will allow trains to run at up to 310 miles an hour.
"The new magnetically levitated, or "maglev," trains would slash the
100-minute travel time down the country's busiest transportation corridor
and are envisioned as a successor for Japan's iconic bullet trains, or
shinkansen, first introduced to the world in 1964 ... [a] spokeswoman
declined to give an estimate for the cost of linking the capital with the
Nagoya area about 269 kilometers (168 miles) to the west. But Kyodo News
agency said the whole project would cost about 9 trillion yen (US$76.3
billion) and be divided between the company and the central and local
governments."

TA_TA_BOX writes "The University of Portland has handed a one-year
suspension to an engineering major after [0]he designed a program to
bypass the Cisco Clean Access (CCA). According to the University of
Portland's Vice President of Information Systems, the purpose of the CCA
is to evaluate whether the computers are compliant with [1]current
security policies (i.e., anti-virus software, Windows Updates and
Patches, etc.). Essentially the student wrote a program that could fool
the CCA to think that the computers operating system and anti-virus were
fully patched and up to date. 'In the design of his computer program,
Maass looked at the functions CCA provides and identified vulnerabilities
where it could be bypassed. He wrote a program that emulated the same
functions as CCA and eliminated some security issues. He says that the
method he chose is "one of six that I came up with." Maass says his
intent was not malicious. Rather, the sophomore says he was examining
vulnerabilities so that they could be fixed. "I was planning on going to
Cisco with the vulnerability this summer," Maass says. '"

he's now said that 'by the end of this year, over half of the songs we
offer on iTunes we believe will be in DRM-free versions. I think we're
going to achieve that.' Jobs pointed out what's obvious to us, the
consumers, but isn't obvious to the music industry — 'People want to own
their music.' He also dismissed subscription based music as a failure,
and claimed a lot of other music labels are intrigued by the EMI deal."

[0]David Shiga writes "Astronomers have identified many objects out there
that they think are black holes. But could they be portals to other
universes called wormholes, instead? According to a new study by a pair
of physicists, we wouldn't be able to tell the difference. They have
discovered that wormholes with the right shape [1]would look identical to
black holes from the outside. But while a trip into a black hole would
mean certain death, a wormhole might spit you out into a parallel
universe with its own stars and planets. Exotic effects from quantum
physics might produce wormholes naturally from collapsing stars, one of
the physicist says, and they might even be produced in future particle
accelerator experiments."

galactic_grub writes "According to an article at New Scientist, DARPA is

disorientate enemies. The system will use a technology known as dynamic
pulse detonation (DPD), which involves producing a ball of plasma with an
intense laser pulse, and then a supersonic shockwave within the plasma
using another pulse. The result is a gigantic flash and a loud bang in a
the air. 'The company has also pitched a portable laser rifle, which
would be lethal, to the US Army. It would weigh about fifteen kilograms,
would have a range of more than a mile, and could have numerous
advantages over existing rifles - better accuracy and the ability to hit
a moving target at the speed of light.'"
