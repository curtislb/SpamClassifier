Yes you can run an HTTP server, and this is how the current library is 
setup.  I don't think the server used by the library currently is 
anything more than a placeholder.  There hasn't been much discussion 
about what a server might look like, though of course you are always 
welcome to bundle your own server with your activity (and I think that 
would be the best plan at the moment).
