Thanks.

Given my very limited experience with Vista, I can't give you an answer right
now.  Once I get a Vista environment installed, I'll be able to look into
this.  I expect that it'll still be a number of weeks before I get that set
up, though.  If you want to experiment with packet traces between (a) two
Vista machines and (b) from an older Windows system to Vista to see whether
any useful information can be gleaned by comparing, I'd certainly be
interested in your results.  In case (a) I expect a purely SMB2 conversation.
The real question will be if case (b) yields any useful ability with original
SMB to retrieve the information in question.

Cheers,

Derrell
