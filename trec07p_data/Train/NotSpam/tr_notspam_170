Hi Ramon,

I've been interested in responses to your question. I have what I
think is a similar issue - I have a very large simulation script and
would like to be able to modularize it by having a main script that
calls lots of subscripts - but I haven't done that yet because the
only way I could think to do it was to call a subscript, have it run,
save the objects from the subscript, and then call those objects back
into the main script, which seems like a very slow and onerous way to
do it.

Would Rserve do what I'm looking for?
