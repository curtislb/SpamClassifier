Yes I can comfir it. I see it as gnome audio problem and audio system
generaly. The solution is not so easy. Alsa is prefered audio system in
kernel but what I know still not exist some useful audio server which
response our needs. Maybe port audio libraries can help but that means
gnome wil have some internal sound server which will use it.

We must think about and search some solution.

Best
