I guess you would have to do all those step for a Internet based portal,
but if you just want to have a web interface on a _Intranet_ portal
where you trust your users, you can use Rpad which is much easier in
that you don't really have to write any code, just do the install
procedure.  There is a Google group for Rpad as well, if you have more
questions about it. 

HTH,

Roger

Sarthi,

I have done what you describe using PHP and R on a linux server.  
Basically, you follow these steps:
- Create a form to gather input
- Parse input from the form with PHP into a file that R can read
- Run R commands from PHP with exec().
- Convert the postscript output to an image a web browser can read,
- Use HTML/PHP to format the output with a link to the image

I learned to do this by studying Alfredo Pontillo and Angelo Mineo's
R-php (http://dssm.unipa.it/R-php). Specifically, look at the file
pages/result/index.php  They have done lots of other good stuff in their
project, like filtering dangerous commands - you would not want to let a
user just type in any R code, because they could seriously damage your
server. However, if you keep the R code on the server, and just parse
numeric or string inputs, you can take the simple approach described
above.

You will need to install GhostScript (http://www.gnu.org/software/
ghostscript/ghostscript.html) and ImageMagick (http://
www.imagemagick.org/) on your server for the image conversion

Feel free to email me directly if you have problems
