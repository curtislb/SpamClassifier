Removed in a later patch.

"import dbus.glib" causes side-effects (and is vaguely deprecated for
that reason), I'm just making it more explicit here. This should probably
be moved to activity.py and gtkui.py though.

I believe bits of Sugar also import dbus.glib, causing the same magical
side-effects.

It uses the global default GLib main loop, and is harmless to do
multiple times.

Will do.

logging.basicConfig() has no effect if there is already a handler on the
root logger, although this call ought to be in gtkui.py really (Sugar
already sets up a handler for the root logger).
