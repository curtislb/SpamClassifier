I wasn't trying to get a what is best answer, just thoughts on strong and 
weak points of the different systems so I can make an informed decission.

I was thinking of gentoo as I previously used it, but remember some of the 
problems if the system was incorrectly configured or over optimised, but 
would prefer to keep away from a system with more than I need (another 
reason to move from ubuntu).

Suppose that in the end results are very close to each other for these 
popular distros, and it just depends on which is most convinient for me to 
manage and get familiar with.
