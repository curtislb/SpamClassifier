The best for me could be if somebody more ZFS/ACL-experienced of me (10 
from 10 :-) ) will check it andsend me a feedback what is wrong. I have 
only tested the "clicking in WinXP" will retrieve the same ACE as I set 
before. I have also checked the "ls -V" lists "expectable" (more or 
less) results but there are some details I need to discuss it with 
somebody experienced....  ...for instance the OWNER@,GROUP@,... default 
ACE's behavior. Currently it looks these default ACEs are striped and it 
does not have any impact on the WinXP behavior but the POSIX permissions 
mask (obtained by "ls -l") seems to be lost on ZFS.

I need more somebody to peer my observations to check the correctness of 
the behavior of this module.

Also me ...and Jeremy too. I want to test this code first out of the 
samba tree than it can be adopted. We will release it in OpenSolaris 
than it will be adopted in 3.0.26 (or 3.0.25b?) this is up to you and 
the samba.org team opinion.
