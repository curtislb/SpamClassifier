Hey all,

I am attempting to build a set of Debian 4.0 netinst iso
images with Speakup but my amd64 install is having network
problems, I'll try Linux in a vmrware on my Windows laptop
eventually if I can't get this figured out.  In the
meantime, if anyone has a developement system they wouldn't
mind providing a temporary account on for a few days, I
could probably do it that way.  Root access would not be
needed.

Rough requirements are as follows.  Machine would have
Debian etch installed or updated testing with build-deps
for linux-2.6 and debian-cd satisfied.
apt-get build-dep linux-2.6 debian-cd
aptitude install initramfs-tools fakeroot subversion
kernel-wedge

Would probably need a few gb of scratch space for kernel
builds, source etc.  Otherwise, I get to see if 32 bit
Windows can run 64 bit Linux under an vmware session, eww.

Shane
