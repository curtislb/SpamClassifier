Hi,

What type of mail mechanism are you using?
Do you really use sendmail or connect smtp server?

Which module are you using?
Do emails sent from the command line also get flagged as SPAM?

try putting the following text in a file named foo.email and then
running "cat foo.email | /usr/bin/sendmail -t".

subject: email from the command line

This is a test of email from the command line.
