You can't set up columns and things for the treeview in glade.
But in the gtk2-perl distribution, there are examples in the examples/
and gtk-demo folders that give some examples of how to do it. You need
to create a model ( in Perl ), and create some treeview columns ( in
Perl ), and append the columns to the treeview, and then connect the
model to the treeview.

I have some examples of setting up different kinds of columns
( including some custom renderers ) in my project,
Gtk2::Ex::datasheet::DBI, which you can find at:
