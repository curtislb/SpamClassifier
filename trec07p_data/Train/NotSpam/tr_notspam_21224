Dear list,

http://www.teachingcommons.ca/ is only one small example of how Creative 
Commons could (and should) enter schools.

As it comes to education and the transfer of knowledge from generation 
to generation, the importance of free (and thus mobile) resources 
becomes very obvious.

I wonder if there is any larger communities of teachers, dealing with 
work sheets and teaching material under free (cc-alike) licence?

Apart from wiki books (possibly host for free school books)

http://creativecommons.org/education/ points to quite few sites.

As for Germany (my home country), there are several community pages 
sharing educational stuff - but mostly under pending/unknown licenses. 

Possibly, a new set of licences could make sense for schools in order to 
make governmental and official institutions use them. Of course it is 
better to keep the amount of different licences low (to 
ease "share-alike" handling) - but maybe you have an idea for an 
attractive "lable" to tag educational stuff with:

Suggestions:
Educative Commons / Teaching Commons / Free Knowledge / Public Heritage
...

Regards
Ralf

P.S.: Thinking about it, an extension of the BY-tag could make sense, 
claiming the naming of the parent version and of its first anchestor 
like this: Derived from <PARENT WORK>, based on the work <ANCHESTOR>.
This makes it easier to keep track of great amounts of variations of a 
work sheet (which might make sense in Math exams for instance).
