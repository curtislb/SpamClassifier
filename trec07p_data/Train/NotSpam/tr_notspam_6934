This is on a bit of a tangent from this discussion, but in case you 
don't already know about it, a Canadian filmmaker, Brett Gaylor, has put 
the process of making a documentary film on a collaborative website, 
Open Source Cinema. He encourages people to upload raw footage, remix 
it, and edit the script of the documentary, allowing the community to 
contribute to the argument it makes.
   http://www.opensourcecinema.org/manifesto

I don't know what Brett uses to run his site, but it might be suitable 
for what you're looking for. It sounds like his project would benefit 
from a repository like the one you're describing.

Cheers,
Andy
