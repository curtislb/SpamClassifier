=20

The shuttle Atlantis' countdown to blastoff began on time Tuesday night and=
 while stormy weather was expected later today, forecasters continue to pre=
dict a 70 percent chance of good weather at launch time Friday.

The only technical issue under discussion involves 2-inch and 4-inch hydrog=
en pressurization lines on the external tank that will be used by shuttle E=
ndeavour in August that are very slightly - a few ten-thousandths of an inc=
h - out of spec. NASA managers are re-evaluating the results of 400-psi lea=
k checks done after Atlantis' tank was mated with the shuttle to make sure =
the lines in question are properly seated.

Some engineers have suggested an additional 600-psi leak test to double-che=
ck the connections, work in Atlantis' engine compartment that would delay l=
aunch three days or so. But given the results of the earlier tests - and no=
rmal checks during the fueling process Friday - it appears likely NASA mana=
gers will press ahead with the countdown for a launch attempt at 7:38 p.m. =
Friday.

NASA managers will brief reporters on the status of launch processing later=
 today after a traditional launch-minus two-day review.

"As always when these things come up with any of our flight hardware, we go=
 off and evaluate if there's any implications to any of our other missions,=
" said NASA Test Director Jeff Spaulding. "They're off looking at that righ=
t now. All of the tests to date and all of the leak checks were all satisfa=
ctory on (Atlantis) and what we're going through today is to talk about the=
 flight rationale."

Shuttle weather officer Kathy Winters said the forecast for Friday calls fo=
r a 70 percent chance of good weather and that the outlook for emergency ru=
nways in California, New Mexico, Spain and France is favorable as well. The=
 forecast worsens a bit to  60 percent "go" Saturday and Sunday should laun=
ch be delayed, primarily due to the threat of afternoon and evening thunder=
storms.

"Our launch day weather actually looks like the best day of the three days,=
" Winters said. "If we happen to delay 24 or 48 hours, the weather looks a =
little bit worse."

Possibly severe afternoon thunderstorms were expected today, with high wind=
s at the launch pad. But Winters said the odds of hail at the pad were low.=
 Atlantis originally was scheduled for launch March 15, but the flight was =
delayed three months to repair damage to the external tank from hail strike=
s during a freak storm in late February.
