						Today's Quote for the Day:
<br>

<br>
"Russia, a country where you never hear of the gangsters of the Russian Maf=
ia   any more. Why? Because they are now all in office." - Best-selling wri=
ter   Frederick Forsyth.=20
<br>
=20
<br>
In tonight's programme:
<br>

<br>
<B>Immigration</b>
<br>

<br>
A clear majority of British people have told a BBC opinion poll that they a=
gree with the Trade and Industry Minister Margaret Hodge in her controversi=
al comments about immigration. She said "British citizens should always get=
 priority for social housing ahead of immigrant families." Her Labour colle=
ague the Education Secretary Alan Johnson accused Ms Hodge of using the lan=
guage "of the BNP."=20
<br>

<br>
Newsnight's Paul Mason has been hearing the views from the heartland of Eng=
land - Nottinghamshire - about immigration, and we'll debate the issue with=
 the Labour MP Keith Vaz and the leader of the BNP, Nick Griffin.
<br>
=20
<br>
<b>Identity Theft</b>
<br>

<br>
At one time thieves targeted jewels or cash as the most lucrative form of c=
rime, but nowadays information can prove just as attractive. Data theft is =
a growing criminal problem and one which is of increasing concern to the re=
gulators. But very little is known about how stolen data is used.=20
<br>

<br>
Martin Shankleman recently uncovered such a scam, and set out to see what h=
appened next. We've also been asking about your experiences of identity the=
ft. Have you been a victim? Do you think those who hold your details do eno=
ugh to stop this kind of theft happening? Join the debate here.=20

<br>
<b>Newsnight Deputy Leadership Debate</b>
<br>

<br>
And we are also looking for your help with a special programme Jeremy Paxma=
n is hosting on Tuesday. He will cross examine the six candidates for the d=
eputy leadership of the Labour Party in a Newsnight special.=20
<br>

<br>
We're giving you the whole bank holiday weekend to think about the question=
s you'd like Jeremy to put to them. Post your thoughts here and we'll arm h=
im with the best ones on Tuesday night.

<br>
<B>And finally...</B>
<br>

<br>
You probably noticed that the Jokes Fit for an Eleven Year Old this week fr=
om Newsnight staff member "Peter C" were truly execrable. Here's one from a=
nother Newsnight staff member whom we'll call "Peter B."=20=20

<br>
Did you hear about the explosion at the Roget's Thesaurus factory?
<br>
=20
<br>
Onlookers were shocked, amazed, stunned, taken aback...
<br>

<br>
Newsnight will have our Thesaurus at the ready at 10.30 on BBC2.

						NEWSNIGHT REVIEW FROM CANNES
					</DIV>
=09=09=09=09=09
					Newsnight Review is at the 60th Cannes Film Festival this week and amo=
ng the films our posse of Julie Myerson, Mark Kermode and John Harris have =
been to see are Persepolis, Iranian director Marjane Satrapi's full length =
tale of growing up during the Islamic Revolution. Deathproof, Quentin Taran=
tino's slasher movie, featuring Kurt Russell as Stuntman Mike on a mad kill=
ing spree. And Julian Schnabel's beautiful film, The Diving Bell and the Bu=
tterfly - Le Scaphandre et Le Papillon - which is based on the autobiograph=
ical novel by Jean-Dominique Bauby. I think it's a good bet for the Palme D=
'Or.
<br>

<br>
Outside the competition there's the sole Brit at the festival, Michael Wint=
erbottom's A Mighty Heart, based on the abduction and murder of US journali=
st Daniel Pearl and Control, Anton Corbijn's film about the death of Joy Di=
vision frontman, Ian Curtis. And I've spoken to Martin Scorsese about his W=
orld Cinema Foundation, Mick Jagger and sex.
<br>

<br>
We're broadcasting from a beachside pavilion, hoping the threatened thunder=
 and lightning doesn't materialise but I'm sure they'll be plenty of sparks=
 on the programme.=20
<br>

<br>
Join us to find out.=20
