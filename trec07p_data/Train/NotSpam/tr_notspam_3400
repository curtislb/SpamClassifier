Greetings:

After the sarge->etch upgrade, I noticed that sound card and soft modem
hardware on this Dell 8600 was properly detected as never before.  After
not being able to use the pctel modem with any 2.6 kernel (I'm now running
a locally compiled 2.6.18) I decided I wanted to use the sl-modem-daemon
package, which installed perfectly, as a voice modem with mgetty/vgetty.

I had done this years ago with a ZyXel 2864, so the configuration wasn't
as bad as it could have been and the sl-modem-daemon docs say that it
works with vgetty.  It's supposed to be a V253 voice modem.
The versions are from etch: sl-modem-daemon and sl-modem-source
(the kernel driver part) 2.9.9d+e-pre2-7etch2.

I can talk to the modem via kermit and send it AT commands.
If I call the modem when kermit is talking to it and I type
ATA (to answer), it does and I hear the modem tone in the calling
phone.  But obviously something is not set up quite right as when
I start vgetty I get this:

04/19 21:48:36 SL0  waiting...                   

I don't see where the mdm_send 'AT+FCLASS=2' is configured,  per the
init script AT+FCLASS=8 is the proper way to initialize the modem for
voice.  Apparently this modem does class 1 fax.  Hopefully this has no
effect, but the V253 initialization seems more serious.

Does anyone know what is mis-configured?  Are the TIOCMGET and TIOCMBIC
errors fatal?

The modem never answers.  Anyone using sl-modem-daemon and vgetty?
I eagerly await any hints, or better, config files.  Thanks!

A.
