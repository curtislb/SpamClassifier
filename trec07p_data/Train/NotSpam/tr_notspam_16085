This only complicates matters. Not only for Etoys (which does not  
have a way to set X properties currently), but I see you had to  
resort to C code even for Python activities. I'd much prefer if the  
only thing Sugar cares about an activity X-wise is its window ID (and  
we're working on a way to make that accessible in Squeak). Everything  
else should be handled by DBus, and this is how it actually was  
before your refactoring. If anything I'd shift communication  
*towards" DBus, not away from it towards X by introducing arbitrary  
and unnecessary properties.

Besides, it does not address the original problem - that if an  
activity X window is opened and detected by the Sugar shell, but it  
has not created its DBus service yet, the shell will mistake it for a  
raw X app (creating a
"raw" icon in the donut next to the still flashing activity icon).  
This can easily be fixed up later by detecting the DBus service  
creation and removing the raw icon - this is how my fix worked.

I do like the cleanup you did to the home model code, but please, can  
we do away with the properties?
