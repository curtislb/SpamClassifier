So long as the OP declares his %hash in the for loop, there's nothing
wrong with how it's initialized.  The OP did not show where he's
declaring it, unfortunately.  If he made the mistake of declaring it
outside the for loop, then he's adding multiple copies of the same
hash to the array, and that single hash is going to be repeatedly
changed through the program.
