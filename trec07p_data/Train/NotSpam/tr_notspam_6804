solitas writes in with news from last week of the [0]discovery of a
fossilized forest in Illinois. The forest was found in the ceiling of a
working coal mine, 250 feet below the surface. It was drowned 300 million
years ago in an earthquake, its discoverers speculate — here is a
[1]graphic of its formation. Geologists are excited because the huge
fossilized forest, over 25 square miles in extent, preserves trees and
other plants upright, as they grew.

[0]AlHunt sends us an AP story on Google's push to [1]help states open up
their data to online searchers. Google is going about this in an
evenhanded way, according to the story, and the results of its labors —
initially in Arizona, California, Utah, and Virginia — will be available
to all search engines, not just theirs. The move is being hailed by
groups such as OpenTheGovernment.org, but the Electronic Privacy
Information Center expressed concerns, given what they call Google's
"checkered past" with regard to privacy on the Internet.

[0]CalicoPenny let us know about yet another "30 days" effort, this one
to name the names of [1]major companies infected with spam-spewing bots.
[2]Support Intelligence began the effort on March 28, out of frustration
at not being able to attract the attention of anyone who could fix the
problems at these companies. While they haven't named 30 companies over
the ensuing month, they did name some prominent ones, such as Thompson
Financial, Bank of America, and AIG. The scary part is that if a bot can
spam it can capture keystrokes or troll for interesting documents.

An anonymous reader passes on word of court documents filed by IBM on
Friday. The documents contain a copy of a letter, dated 2004, from SCO to
IBM's lawyers stating that they tried to [0]keep Linus Torvalds from
making disparaging public statements about SCO, speculating erroneously
that IBM was the principal funder of OSDL, where Torvalds worked at the
time. Quoting: "The company also tried to silence Eben Moglen, the
Columbia University professor who, until this month, was a director of
the Free Software Foundation, and Eric Raymond, a controversial
open-source advocate, saying they claimed to be IBM consultants."

rash of high-profile mobile phone taps in Italy is [0]spurring a rush
toward software-encrypted phone conversations. Private conversations have
been tapped and subsequently leaked to the media and have resulted in
disclosures of sensitive takeover discussions, revelations regarding
game-fixing in soccer, and the arrest of a prince on charges of providing
prostitutes and illegal slot machines. An Italian investigative reporter
stated that no one would ever discuss sensitive information on the phone
now. As a result, encryption software for mobile phones has moved from
the government and military worlds into the mainstream. Are GSM phones in
the US ripe for a similar explosion in the use of freely available
wiretapping technology, and could this finally be the impetus to for
widespread use of software-encrypted communications?"

[0]ColinPL writes with a link to an AP article about a public scolding
the US has given China, Russia, and several other nations. [1]Failure to
'sufficiently protect' American copyrights is the cause of the Bush
administration's ire, and has resulted in these countries showing up on a
'priority watch list' that could eventually lead to economic sanctions.
"In addition to Russia and China, the 10 countries placed on the priority
watch list were Argentina, Chile, Egypt, India, Israel, Lebanon,
Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine and Venezuela. In elevating Thailand to the
priority watch list, the administration said it was concerned by a range
of issues including a 'deteriorating protection for patents and
copyrights.' Thailand is currently in a dispute with international drug
companies including Abbott Laboratories of the United States over the
cost of drugs to fight AIDS and other diseases. The Thai government in
January issued compulsory licenses allowing the use of much cheaper
generic versions of two leading drugs in Thailand."

whoever57 writes "Forbes has up an article on the consequences of being
dumped into a claimed 'supplemental index', [0] also known as 'Google
Hell'. It uses the example of Skyfacet, a site selling diamonds rings and
other jewelery, which has dropped in Google's rankings and saw a $500,000
drop in revenue in only three months after the site owner paid a
marketing consultant to improve the sites. The article claims that sites
in the supposed 'supplemental index' may be visited by Google's spiders
as infrequently as once per year. The problem? Google's cache shows that
Google's spiders visited the site ss recently as late April. 'Google Hell
is the worst fear of the untold numbers of companies that depend on
search results to keep their business visible online. Getting stuck there
means most users will never see the site, or at least many of the site's
pages, when they enter certain keywords. And getting out can be next to
impossible--because site operators often don't know what they did to get
placed there.'"

Mohite said the pact means they do not have to go through the lengthy
process of asking the Central government to communicate with Orkut. The
practice so far has been to first send a request to the Centre's computer
emergency response team in New Delhi. This team processes the request
through its channels and even if a forum is finally blocked, the
"culprits" still remain untraceable as no IP addresses can be obtained
... "Now we can do away with the process and not just directly ban
content but also obtain details of IP addresses and service providers
quickly," Mohite said.' How long before we see these 'informal

phones that get sold, I'd prefer to have our software in 60% or 70% or
80% of them, than I would to have 2% or 3%, which is what Apple might
get. In the case of music, Apple got out early. They were the first to
really recognize that you couldn't just think about the device and all
the pieces separately. Bravo. Credit that to Steve (Jobs) and Apple. They
did a nice job. But it's not like we're at the end of the line of

Watson's comments all center around the idea that Microsoft is a leader
with UAC, and that other OSes should follow suit. UAC is a cousin of
myriad "superuser" process elevation strategies, of which Mac OS X and
all flavors of Linux already enjoy. The fact is that Microsoft is late to
the party with their Microsoftized version of sudo. That's really what
UAC is, after all: sudo with a fancy display mechanism (to make it hard

mrogers sends us to Infowars for the following news from the UK, "which
is fast becoming the front line of the war on privacy": "'Read my
lips..."' used to be a figurative saying. Now the British government is
considering taking it literally by [0]adding lip reading technology to
some of the [1]four million or so surveillance cameras in order identify
terrorists and criminals by watching what everyone says. Perhaps the
lip-reading cameras and the [2]shouting cameras will find something to
talk about."

[0]Billosaur writes "Imagine the PayPal security tool embedded on a
credit card. VeriSign is announcing that a deal is in the works to
[1]provide credit cards with one-time-use passwords. By placing the
technology directly on the card, it becomes more convenient and provides
an extra layer of security for online credit-card transactions. A
cardholder would type in their information as normal and then would be
prompted to enter the passcode displayed on the card. This means a user
would need to have the physical card in hand in order to use it, thus
thwarting identity thieves who steal credit card information but do not
possess the card itself. VeriSign said it expects to announce a major
bank using its cards in May."

it had simply disappeared from Digg. How long until the long arm of the

[0]axlrosen alerts us to a Microsoft sleeper announcement from Mix07: a
version of its [1]Common Language Runtime will be available
cross-platform. The Core CLR shows up as part of the [2]Silverlight SDK
that Redmond is open sourcing. From the blog posting: "The biggest Mix
'07 announcement made on opening day of this week's show was one that
Microsoft didn't call out in any of its own press releases: Microsoft is
making a version of its Common Language Runtime available cross-platform.
The CLR is the heart of Microsoft's .Net Framework programming model. So,
by association, the .Net Framework isn't just for Windows any more."

An anonymous reader writes "[0]IDEMA has finally [1]released the LBD
(Long Block Data) standard. This standard, in work since 2000, increases
the length of the data blocks of each sector from 512 bytes to 4,096
bytes. This is an update that has been requested for some time by the
hard-drive industry and the development of new drives will start
immediately. The new standard offers many advantages — improved
reliability and higher transfer rates are the two most obvious. While
some manufacturers say the reliability may increase as much as tenfold,
the degree of performance improvement to be expected is a bit more
elusive. Overall improvements include shorter time to format and more
efficient data transfers due to smaller overhead per block during read
and write operations."

RulerOf writes "Musicians recently [0]unlocked a 600 year old mystery
that had been encoded into the walls of the Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland,
the one featured in The Da Vinci Code. The song was carved into the walls
of the chapel in the form of geometric shapes that a father-son team —
both are musicians and the father is an ex-Royal Air Force code breaker —
finally matched to so-called Chladni patterns (see the [1]Wikipedia
article on cymatics). The recovered melody was paired with traditional
lyrics (translated into Latin) and recorded; the result can be [2]heard
in this video (also linked from [3]the musicians' website). The video
also gives a visual representation of how the engravings match up to the
cymatic patterns." From the Reuters article: "'The music has been frozen
in time by symbolism... [The carvings] are of such exquisite detail and
so beautiful that we thought there must be a message here.' The two men
matched each of the patterns on the carved cubes to a Chladni pitch, and
were able finally to unlock the melody."

[0]Ron writes "Symantec security researcher Yazan Gable has put forward
an explanation as to [1]why the number of denial of service attacks has
been declining (coincident with the rise of spam). His theory is that DoS
attacks are no longer profitable to attackers. While spam and phishing
attacks directly generate profit, he argues that extortion techniques
often used with DoS attacks are far more risky and often make an attacker
no profit at all. Gable writes: 'So what happens if the target of the
attack refuses to pay? The DoS extortionist is obligated to carry out a
prolonged DoS attack against them to follow through on their threats. For
a DoS extortionist, this is the worst scenario because they have to risk
their bot network for nothing at all. Since the target has refused to
pay, it is likely that they will never pay. As a consequence, the
attacker has to spend time and resources on a lost cause.'"
