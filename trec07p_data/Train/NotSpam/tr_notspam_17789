Yep, though its now slightly altered from that code.

Well we hook in at the nt_acl VFS layer, not the POSIX ACL layer  
though I could probably add support for that as well. I guess we  
could do the native->NFSv4->NT conversion, but it feels icky. I'll  
look at it more closely when the time comes.
