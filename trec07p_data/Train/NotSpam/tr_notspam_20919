If you mean the dos attributes, you should really go with the classic:
store dos attributes = yes
map read only = no
map archive = no
map system = no
map hidden = no

and let samba store the bits in an EA.
This will get off the way the annoying manipulation of the x bits and
the r for the user).

Not sure we can really do this with the current samba3 VFS
infrastructure. In any case storing the ACL in an EA is not the problem,
the problem is then enforcing them.

Simo.
