Edwards to address "Two Americas" at NYC's Cooper Union

Reprising a major theme from his 2004 presidential campaign, John Edwards will lay out a middle class economic plan
Thursday designed to merge "Two Americas" into "One."

"I have learned something in the last four years," Edwards will tell an audience at Cooper Union College in New York
City. "It's not enough to talk about the Two Americas.	We also need to talk about what we need to do to build One
America – and to do that, I believe we have to build One American Economy."

According to the Edwards campaign, the former vice presidential nominee will detail his plan to stop "abusive lenders,"
reduce consumer debt and create "a new Family Savings and Credit Commission" to assist those "who are investing and
borrowing."

"It's time we did more than say 'buyer beware' while millions of families go broke every year," Edwards will say
according to speech excerpts provided to the Ticker.  "We should put in place the same consumer protections for
financial products that we have for everything else Americans can buy. And when I'm president, I'll do just that."

Economic equality and poverty are two main elements of Edwards' campaign theme and platform.  In 2004 Edwards' stump
speech included a lengthy refrain on "Two Americas" which he said illustrated the large gap between the 'haves" and
"have-nots" in the country.

SECOND VETO FOR STEM CELL LEGISLATION: President Bush on Wednesday issued his second veto of a measure lifting his
restrictions on human embryonic stem cell experiments. The move effectively pushed the contentious scientific and
ethical debate surrounding the research into the 2008 presidential campaign. "Destroying human life in the hopes of
saving human life is not ethical," Mr. Bush said in a brief ceremony in the East Room of the White House. He called the
United States "a nation founded on the principle that all human life is sacred." At the same time, Mr. Bush issued an
executive order intended to encourage scientists to pursue other forms of stem cell research that he does not deem
unethical. But that research is already going on, and the plan provides no new money. New York Times: Bush Vetoes
Measure on Stem Cell Research http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/21/washington/21stem.html

ENERGY BILL DELAYS NEW DEBATE ON IMMIGRATION: Infighting within the Senate Democratic Caucus has stalled work on the
chamber's energy bill, forcing Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) to delay resumption of the immigration debate until
the beginning of next week, Reid said Wednesday. At press time Reid and other Democratic leaders were working to bring
an end to a fight between backers of more stringent automotive efficiency rules and Michigan Democratic Sens. Carl
Levin and Debbie Stabenow, who are seeking to reduce those levels. But with progress in the mediation slow, Reid was
forced to push back several key votes until next week. In addition to a vote on a motion to proceed to immigration,
Reid also was expected to delay a vote to take up legislation that would change the way workers vote on whether to form
a union. Roll Call: Immigration Bill Postponed http://www.rollcall.com/issues/52_144/news/19070-1.html

SOME NOLA NEIGHBORHOODS REMAIN VULNERABLE TO FLOODING: Many parts of New Orleans struck hardest by Hurricane Katrina
remain vulnerable to flooding despite nearly two years of attempts to protect them, a study published Wednesday by the
Army Corps of Engineers found. The assessment, laid out online in a series of neighborhood maps, is the first time the
corps has identified in detail the areas that still face substantial danger from flooding. It shows a 100-year storm
today would likely bury most of Gentilly and the Lower 9th Ward — two of the neighborhoods that suffered most after
Katrina — under more than 8 feet of water. A 100-year storm is one whose severity has a 1% chance of being met or
exceeded in any year. Even in those neighborhoods, the corps' assessment suggests the areas vulnerable to severe
flooding are smaller than they were before Katrina because of upgrades to New Orleans' levees. USA Today: Army Corps
maps neighborhoods' flood risks online http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20070621/a_nolevy21.art.htm

SOME HEALTH CARE LOBBYISTS SHOW UP FOR "SiCKO": About a dozen healthcare lobbyists answered filmmaker Michael Moore's
challenge and turned out for an advanced screening yesterday of his critical take on the American healthcare system.
Moore ran newspaper advertisements this week, including one that appeared in The Hill, listing the names of about 900
lobbyists registered for healthcare clients and invited anyone on the list to a free showing of his film, "SiCKO."
Moore welcomed the lobbyists to the screening, but made clear that he believes their clients are responsible for the
problems of the healthcare system. The Hill: Small percentage of invited lobbyists show up for Moore 'SiCKO' screening

SUPER DUPER LAND OF LINCOLN: Gov. Rod Blagojevich on Wednesday added Illinois to the list of states that are
accelerating the selection of presidential candidates next year by signing a measure moving the state's primary to Feb.
5 from its traditional mid-March date. "Illinois is the fifth-largest state in the country," Blagojevich said in a
statement. "The people who live here deserve to play a bigger role in deciding who the presidential candidates will
be." Illinois' primary date change was orchestrated by the state's Democratic leadership. Ostensibly aimed at giving
the state's voters more say in selecting delegates, supporters acknowledged it largely was done to boost home-state
U.S. Sen. Barack Obama's bid for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination. Chicago Tribune: Illinois joins crush on
Super Duper Tuesday http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-primary21jun21,1,2652555.story

BLOOMBERG CAMP "LAID THE GROUNDWORK" FOR INDIE BID: The announcement by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York that he
was leaving the Republican Party to become an independent was made after nearly two years in which his aides had laid
the groundwork for a potential independent run for president. They collected technical data on the requirements to put
Mr. Bloomberg on the ballot in 50 states either as a third party or an independent candidate. Mr. Bloomberg went to
Washington for a round of meetings with opinion leaders and traveled the country giving political speeches, including
two this week in California. And Mr. Bloomberg told associates that he was closely studying the 1992 presidential
campaign of H. Ross Perot, the wealthy Texan and friend who drew 19 percent of the vote as an independent, to figure
out how much a race in 2008 would cost. New York Times: For 2 Years, Bloomberg Aides Prepared for Bid
http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/21/us/politics/21bloomberg.html

NO HARD FEELINGS, MIKE: Rudolph Giuliani said Wednesday that it's fine with him if Mayor Michael Bloomberg decides to
jump into the race for president as a third-party contender -- but the ex-mayor criticized his City Hall successor for
quitting the Republican party to clear the way. Giuliani insisted there would be no hard feelings if Bloomberg one day
stands between him and the White House, even though it was Giuliani's backing of the billionaire businessman and
political neophyte that helped launched Bloomberg's career as mayor. "Because I endorsed somebody, he doesn't owe
anything to me. I don't owe anything to him," Giuliani told reporters here. "I have nothing bad to say about Mike
except -- except -- I am disappointed that he left the Republican Party." Newsday: Rudy: No hard feelings if Mike runs
http://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/nation/ny-usrudy0621,0,3739309.story

JOINING ISG "A MISTAKE," SAYS RUDY: Republican presidential contender Rudy Giuliani said Wednesday it was a mistake for
him to join the Iraq Study Group, on which he lasted just two months and failed to show for any official meetings. The
former New York mayor has tried to tamp down criticism in recent days after Newsday reported that Giuliani was a
no-show for two of the group's meetings and instead attended paid public appearances. "I thought it would work, but
then after a month or two I realized the idea that I was possibly going to run for president would be inconsistent with
that," Giuliani said during a campaign stop in Iowa. Giuliani said the main reason he quit was that it "didn't seem
that I would really be able to keep the thing focused on a bipartisan, nonpolitical resolution." AP via Yahoo! News:
Giuliani: Joining Iraq group a mistake http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070621/ap_on_el_pr/giuliani_iraq_group

NADER "SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING" '08 BID: Ralph Nader says he is seriously considering running for president in 2008
because he foresees another Tweedledum-Tweedledee election that offers little real choice to voters. "You know the two
parties are still converging -- they don't even debate the military budget anymore," Nader said in a 30-minute
interview. "I really think there needs to be more competition from outside the two parties." Even the possible entry of
New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg into the race as an independent might not dissuade Nader. "He is interesting (but)
unpredictable," Nader said of Bloomberg. "I really like the stand he took against smoking, but he goes along with
corporate welfare in New York and tax-funded stadiums. So he is unfinished in that way." The Politico: Nader ponders
another 'spoiler' campaign http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0607/4580.html

THOMPSON "TURBO-CHARGING" FUNDRAISING OPERATION: Former Sen. Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.) has hired a finance director for
the Northeast and Midwestern regions, turbo-charging his money machine for a full-on bid for the White House. The Hill
has learned that Sarah Newman, now at the Washington lobbying firm of Cassidy and Associates, has been hired by
Thompson's campaign as one of its top regional finance directors. Newman would not comment when contacted by The Hill.
Thompson spokesman Mark Corallo said by e-mail that the campaign is still very much in exploratory mode, but has no
announcements to make yet. The Hill: Thompson money machine shifts gear and picks up pace

DISCIPLINE, LOYALTY, AND LEGENDARY SECRECY IN "HILLARYLAND": OF Once seen as a tight little sorority, today the group
-- happily self-described as "Hillaryland"-- is at the center of a front-running presidential campaign. Never have so
many women operated at such a high level in one campaign, working with a discipline and a loyalty and a legendary
secrecy rarely seen at this level of American politics. Older and tougher, they have formed a closely knit Praetorian
Guard around Clinton that plots strategy, develops message and clamps down on leaks. But their extraordinary
protectiveness also contributes to an ongoing perception of insularity around the candidate and the campaign.

HILLARY BOOED AT TAKE BACK AMERICA, BUT NOT AS MUCH AS LAST YEAR: It wasn't the derisive reception she got a year ago,
but Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton still endured a gust of boos Wednesday when explaining her position on the Iraq war
before an audience of liberal activists eager for a quick end to the conflict. Speaking at a forum of Democratic
presidential candidates, the New York senator was largely applauded as she denounced the Bush administration for its
opposition to stem cell research, inaction during Hurricane Katrina and the practice of wiretapping phone calls without
warrants. "Our Constitution is being shredded," she said in a morning appearance at the Take Back America conference,
sponsored by the nonprofit Campaign for America's Future. Trouble came when she turned to Iraq. A year ago, the group
had heckled Clinton when she said she did not want to set timetables for withdrawing American forces from Iraq. This
time, her stance seemed more in step with her listeners, though not sufficiently antiwar for some. Los Angeles Times:
Clinton greeted by fewer boos on Iraq war

RETURN OF BUBBA: Bubba's back. Bill Clinton used to be a stealth presence in his wife's presidential campaign, raising
money and schmoozing supporters largely out of the public eye. This week, the former president stepped into the
spotlight, from his humorous turn in a new Web video to the announcement that he will join Hillary Rodham Clinton on
high-profile campaign visits to Iowa and New Hampshire. Aides say Bill Clinton has long planned to campaign publicly
for his wife, and Hillary Clinton often promises audiences they'll see a lot more of him. Mindful of his charisma and
tendency to hog the attention, the campaign has played the Bill card carefully — keeping him in the shadows while
giving Hillary Clinton time to establish herself independently. They followed a similar pattern in 2000 when she first
ran for the Senate in New York. AP via Yahoo! News: Bill Clinton takes bigger campaign role
http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070621/ap_on_el_pr/the_bill_factor

ROMNEY RAISES $1 MILLION ON McCAIN'S TURF: Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney has topped $1 million in contributions
in Arizona, the home state of presidential rival John McCain, Romney campaign officials said Wednesday. Sen. McCain's
campaign spokesman Danny Diaz dismissed the announcement by the Romney campaign, saying McCain has raised more than
twice that amount in Arizona. "We've also done well raising money in Massachusetts," Diaz said. "Senator McCain has
been elected and re-elected in Arizona time and time again." Romney is expected to add another $175,000 after speaking
to 250 supporters at a fundraiser Wednesday night in Gilbert, a rapidly growing town east of Phoenix. AP via Yahoo!
News: Romney tops $1 million in Arizona http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070621/ap_on_el_pr/romney_mccain

TARGETING ROMNEY'S FAITH: Over the past year, staff or volunteers from at least three opposing campaigns have, at times
subtly and at times not, spread negative information about Mormons in an apparent effort to damage [Mitt] Romney's bid
for the presidency... [W]hile the impact of the anti-Mormon messages is difficult to measure, the number of incidents
suggests that Romney's religion will remain a tempting target for political opponents seeking a competitive edge. The
most recent example came to light earlier this week when the Washington Post reported that Emma Nemecek, an Iowa field
operative for Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas, had recently forwarded an e-mail to Iowa Republicans containing a number
of criticisms of Mormonism, including a charge that it is not a Christian faith. Boston Globe: Rival camps take aim at
Romney's religion http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/06/21/rival_camps_take_aim_at_romneys_religion/

NEW BIO REVEALS THE "CALCULATING POLITICIAN" IN OBAMA: A soon-to-be-released biography about Sen. Barack Obama portrays
the Democratic presidential candidate as a far more calculating politician than his most ardent supporters might
imagine. One such calculation was his much-heralded 2002 speech in Chicago about the impending Iraq war, according to
"Obama: From Promise to Power," a nearly 400-page book by Tribune reporter David Mendell to be released in August.
Obama gave the speech not just because of a desire to speak out about the impending invasion, Mendell asserts, but also
to curry favor with a potential political patron, Bettylu Saltzman, a stalwart among Chicago's liberal elite, and to
also try to win over his future top political adviser, David Axelrod, who was close to Saltzman. Chicago Tribune: Obama
bio cites hidden '02 agenda http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-070620obama-story,1,4328906.story

SF MAYOR FENDS OFF COCAINE ALLEGATIONS FROM "CITY HALL ARCHENEMY": Mayor Gavin Newsom categorically denied ever using
cocaine Wednesday and blasted Supervisor Chris Daly for raising the allegation during a packed Board of Supervisors
meeting a day earlier, saying his City Hall archenemy had brought San Francisco politics to a new low. Newsom, who
earlier this year entered rehab for a drinking problem, angrily responded to reporters' questions about whether he has
ever used the drug, saying, "Absolutely not." "I am associated with something that I don't do, never have, not even in
the realm of reason should someone even accuse me of this," Newsom said. San Francisco Chronicle: CITY HALL UPROAR AT
