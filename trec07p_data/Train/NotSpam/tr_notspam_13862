Of course, but the usage of free there is merely an extension of its
actual english meaning.[1] We use "free" in our conversations about
licensing and software because of the meaning that it already
posseses, not the other way around.

The word "proprietary" has a perfectly well defined meaning in this
field. It means closed or exclusive. That people mistakenly conflate
it with being non-freeness has little to do with its actual meaning.

Things that are non-proprietary are perfectly capable of being
non-free. See for example the works in non-free for which we actually
have source code. They are clearly not proprietary, but are definetly
not free.

It can refer to that, but it can also refer to specifications,
standards, protocols, goods, etc. Exclusivity is nearly a synonym for
proprietary.

English has a great deal of words which have multiple definitions on
which generations of english speakers have agreed upon and/or abused.
The meaning of a word which has multiple definitions is generally
clarified from context, and if not, it's trival to ask.

What you're attempting to do is not comparable; it's inventing new
definitions for words which are not commonly or historically agreed
upon.
