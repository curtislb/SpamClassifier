ALERT OF THE WEEK: MONSANTO & BIG FOOD ATTACK LOCAL RIGHTS TO REGULATE FOOD=
 AND CROPS=20
Since 1998, the biotech industry and industrial food corporations have unsu=
ccessfully tried to take away local and states' rights to ban or regulate g=
enetically modified organisms (GMOs) and other controversial foods and crop=
s. For example, OCA and other public interest groups successfully generated=
 a mass outcry in 2006 that blocked the passage of the National Uniformity =
for Food Act. This highly unpopular bill would have nullified 200 food safe=
ty and food labeling laws across the U.S. Failing to suppress grassroots co=
ntrol over food safety laws and labels in the last session of Congress, ind=
ustry has now called on their friends in the House Subcommittee on Livestoc=
k, Dairy, and Poultry to slip a similar poison pill into an obscure section=
 of the voluminous 2007-2012 Farm Bill. The provision would give the White =
House appointed Secretary of Agriculture the power to eliminate local or st=
ate food and farming laws, such as those in four California counties bannin=
g genetically engineered crops, and set an an ominous precedent undermining=
 states' rights.  Tell Congress to repeal this provision before it becomes =
law: http://www.organicconsumers.org/articles/article_5424.cfm

GOOD NEWS OF THE WEEK: VENEZUELA MOVES TO BAN FRANKENCROPS
Monsanto's plans to grow 500,000 acres of genetically engineered crops in V=
enezuela have been thwarted by the nation's popular President, Hugo Chavez.=
 According to Chavez, when he learned about Monsanto's Plans, "I ordered an=
 end to the project. This project is terminated." Chavez is now encouraging=
 Venezuela's national legislature to pass some of the most sweeping restric=
tions on genetically modified organisms in the entire Western Hemisphere.  =

ALERT UPDATE:  OCA'S BOYCOTT OF HORIZON CONTINUES AS COMPANY'S STOCK PLUMME=
TS=20
April marked the one year anniversary of OCA's boycott of factory farmed da=
iry products produced by Horizon Organic and Aurora. Ninety-six percent of =
Organic Bytes readers, in an online survey in 2006, voted to launch a boyco=
tt of so-called "USDA Organic" brands sourcing dairy products from intensiv=
e confinement feedlots where the cows have little or no access to pasture, =
and where many of the calves have been purchased from conventional farms. A=
 loophole in the USDA Organic Standards has allowed two companies, Horizon =
and Aurora, to buy their milk from "organic" factory farms where as many as=
 10,000 cows are packed into feedlots. Although Horizon claims the OCA boyc=
ott has not affected sales, Executive Gregg Engles recently admitted to inv=
estors that profits for the year have been much lower than projected. The c=
ompany's stock market price has recently dropped 11 percent. In addition Wa=
l-Mart, Wild Oats, Safeway, Costco, Woodstock Farms, Publix, and other priv=
ate label vendors of Aurora's feedlot milk are coming under increasing crit=
icism from consumers.  Learn more about this campaign and take part in the =
boycott: http://www.organicconsumers.org/sos.cfm

QUOTE OF THE WEEK:  PLANET'S POPULATION IS NOW MORE URBAN THEN RURAL
"So far, cities are getting whatever resource needs that can be had from ru=
ral areas. But given global rural impoverishment, the rural-urban question =
for the future is not just what rural people and places can do for the worl=
d's new urban majority. Rather, what can the urban majority do for poor rur=
al people and the resources upon which cities depend for existence? The sus=
tainable future of the new urban world may well depend upon the answer." Dr=
. Ron Wimberley, Professor of Sociology at NC, addressing the fact that as =
of May 23, 2007, the world's population for the first time is primarily urb=
an.

PRODUCT PLUNDER OF THE WEEK:  CANCER-CAUSING BENZENE IN SODA DRINKS
The problem of cancer causing benzene turning up in sodas seems to pop up i=
n the U.S. with alarming regularity. Last week, the FDA reported that it te=
sted 100 sodas and found unacceptable levels of the known carcinogen in fiv=
e of the drinks. Some of these drinks had benzene levels nearly 100 times t=
hat which is considered safe by the EPA for drinking water. The toxin is fo=
rmed when a soda manufacturer uses two ingredients that can react to form b=
enzene: ascorbic acid and sodium benzoate or potassium benzoate. Soda compa=
nies found to have dangerous levels of benzene have vowed to reformulate th=
eir drinks. In the meantime, boycott the following beverages and consider a=
voiding any soda with the "toxic two" ingredients, found in an astoundingly=
 high number of popular drinks. (As a note, beverages labeled as "organic" =
cannot contain these ingredients.)=20

Sodas Found to Contain Carcinogenic Benzene:=20

WEB VIDEO & ACTION OF THE WEEK:
WATCH MICHAEL MOORE'S INTERVIEW AND TAKE ACTION FOR UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE
If you've been reading OCA's Health Page you're aware of the sorry state of=
 the nation's health care system. In 2000, the World Health Organization ra=
nked our system (which is the most expensive in the world) 37th, just after=
 war-torn and drug-ravaged Columbia. In the last seven years, with cuts in =
employee health benefits and miserly HMO coverage, things have only gotten =
worse. A 2007 report by the Commonwealth Fund ranks the US last among other=
 rich countries in health care access, patient safety, efficiency, and equi=
ty, despite the fact that it spends twice as much on health care. This is t=
he subject of Michael Moore's new documentary, "Sicko." The difference betw=
een the US and countries with better health outcomes? Universal health care=
.

QUICK FACTS OF THE WEEK:  GREEN CONSUMERS CAN'T FIND GREEN GOODS
A new Hartman Group survey indicates that consumers have generated a greate=
r demand for green and sustainably produced products than the market is abl=
e to provide. While the vast majority of consumers say they want to purchas=
e a wide variety of products from companies with sustainability ethics, rel=
atively few consumers actually know where to find those products. Nearly 3 =
out of 4 U.S. consumers believe their purchases have significant impact on =
society.

71% say they would pay more for sustainably made products.

Only 5% of consumers can name companies that they know have values based on=
 sustainability.

Only one in ten consumers know where they can buy sustainably made products=
.

___________________________________

WEB TIP OF THE WEEK:  ONLINE SHOPPING FOR THE GREEN-MINDED
Although finding sustainably made products in your local strip-mall may be =
difficult, there are an increasing number of independently owned retailers,=
 coops and online businesses where you can research and/or buy green produc=
ts from green companies. The Organic Consumers Association has teamed up wi=
th GreenPeople.org to bring you one of the world's largest directories of g=
reen and organic businesses. Buy Green, Sell Green, Be Green Find Green Pro=
ducts and Services in Your Area and nationwide. http://www.organicconsumers=

HEALTH TIP OF THE WEEK:  CANADIANS MAKE IT OFFICIAL: TEA IS GOOD FOR YOU
Last week, the Canadian government officially deemed tea (black, green and =
oolong) as having medicinal qualities. Although the news of tea's health be=
nefits may not seem surprising, this story becomes particularly noteworthy =
when put in the context of the sheer difficulty of convincing U.S. & Canadi=
an governments to acknowledge specific health benefits of herbs. After revi=
ewing hundreds of studies conducted over the past few decades, the Canadian=
 government stated there is enough evidence to prove that these particular =
teas are stimulants, support cardiovascular health and are an important die=
tary source of antioxidants. Tea is second only to water as the healthiest =
beverage choice, according to healthy beverage guidelines that were develop=
ed by a panel of American nutrition experts and published in the March 2006=
 issue of the Journal of American Clinical Nutrition. According to experts =
like Dr. Carol Greenwood, a Professor of Nutritional Sciences at the Univer=
sity of Toronto, "Tea is one of the highest sources of antioxidants in the =
diet." The U.S. FDA has rejected petitions similar to what Canada approved =
this week, saying there is no evidence supporting these herbal health claim=
s.  Learn more: http://www.organicconsumers.org/articles/article_5401.cfm
