Do you have a batch file already to do this?  If I were writing it, I'd 
do something simpler:  I'd just hard code the paths, and expect the user 
to edit the file if I didn't get them right.

I agree, but there is a lot of Perl code in the R scripts now, and I 
think the maintainers of those scripts are comfortable with it.  I think 
R code for string handling is even harder to read than Perl, so it's not 
likely to change.

This is not really relevant.  The Unix command line tools are fine: 
Rtools.exe installs them, and they just work, if you get the PATH right. 
  The current "problem children" are Perl, LaTeX, and HHW. (Also Inno 
Setup, but it's not for package builders).

Rewriting the Perl code as R scripts is imaginable, but rewriting LaTeX 
and HHW in R is not.

It might be possible to automate the tests by looking at the PATH. 
Neither LaTeX nor HHW is necessarily going to show up at a predictable 
location in the registry.
