    Jerry> [profiles.V2] copy = profiles

Vista clients take the profile path from the AD user object and add
".V2" because XP (and before) profiles are not compatible with Vista
profiles.

In a Windows only environment, the profile paths would normally point
to something like \\server\share\username so adding ".V2" to the end
doesn't change the share name, but the directory name.

I haven't come across the "copy = ..." construct before, but if it's
used in this case to point XP and Vista clients at the same directory
on the server for the user profiles, then user data is at risk.

Thought it's best to have this clarified for the archives :)

Cheers,

Kenny.
