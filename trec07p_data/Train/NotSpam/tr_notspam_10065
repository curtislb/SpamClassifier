But what about JoAnnConnors? JKRowling? HunterSThompson? Parsingwikinames effectively is a tricky business. Unless the rules governingname creation were very strict--only allowing a certain number ofcapitals--or only allowing capitals in certain places, which was theoriginal intention, but most wikis don't actually force users to takenames like JrrTolkien--you'll probably want to pass anything withthree or more caps to a human for processing, or at least to a moresophisticated routine:
    my ($fisrt, $last)    my @name = $wikiname = /([A-Z][a-z]*)/g;    if (@name <= 2) {        ($first, $last) = @name;    else {        figure_it_out(@name);    }
figure_it_out could either just email the name to person forclarification, or apply a little logic. Maybe match list elementsagainst common name parts:
    if (@name[-2] =~ /^Ma?c/) {        $first = join ' ', @name[0..-3];        $last = @name[-2] . @name[-1];
etc.
