CNN Tonight:  Larry Birkhead is the Father!

The long-awaited DNA results are in – with Larry
Birkhead confirmed as baby Dannielynn’s father!
Does this mean the battle is over?
An exclusive with Howard K. Stern’s sister!
Plus, the doctor who performed the
paternity test and reaction from the Bahamas.

Then, Don Imus is set to meet with the Rutgers
women’s basketball team over his racial slurs.
But before they meet with Imus, the
team’s coach and captain talk to Larry!

Tonight only on Larry King Live!
