I don't believe there's a benefit for a certain type, but all types.  
There will be less time moving data around, and keeping the same data 
in the same places.  The less you move data around, the more you 
improve speed.  Proven concepts for compiling to a register based 
machine will be easier to implement.  And since after all, speed is 
often in large part to the compiler, a better compiler will create 
better programs.  So speed will be a combination of parrot version, and 
compiler version.

When it comes to which is better for a type of language, both Java and 
Perl 5 use a stack based machine, but Python can be ran as native code 
or on a JVM, so it's hard to truly say what is best for a type of 
language.  To me personally, a virtual machine simulating real hardware 
as much as practical is a great benefit.

A language can use whatever semantics it so chooses.  But 
interoperability between languages will likely be broken, and they 
won't be able to utilize future improvements in parrot.  Part of the 
whole point of parrot is to provide one portable virtual machine for 
languages.  Languages will be able to benefit from improvements in 
parrot without needing to spend all their time on their own virtual 
machine.  If you have an idea for a new language, you can use parrot as 
a base and deal solely with designing and compiling, instead of 
running.

What about static typing is so fast?  Compiler optimizations help, but 
those can still exist.  I don't see any reason why parrot can't still 
run statically typed code faster than dynamically typed code(as is 
often the case anyway).

Parrot has a benefit of starting from scratch.  We aren't trying to 
compile java to perl 5's vm, or compiling perl 5 to java's vm, instead 
we're building a vm that will work well for them all without late term 
slow hacks.  A language won't need to use all of parrot's features.  
Most won't, but they won't need to use weird hacks to get the 
functionality they need.  They can use a subset of parrot.

Personally, I rarely use some of the higher level features of parrot.  
But parrot having the additional features doesn't seem to slow down my 
code at all.  Sometimes I want to mix regular expressions and jitable 
assembly.

I'm not sure anything is lost.  Perhaps when a Java to Parrot compiler 
and a Perl 5 to Parrot compiler are both finished, we can see how they 
compare to their "original" vm's.

There's no reason for parrot to hinder one languages performance.  Can 
you give an example of code to use that would help others to understand 
your question?  Vague questions get vague answers, or no answers.  
Clarify for us, please.

There is no immediate plan for embedded systems.  But the groundwork is

All PIR is compiled to PBC, a portable(including endianness) format for 
executing.  Parrot can run it directly, or compile and run it in 
memory.  You can take a PBC file written on a power pc and run it on 
IA64(theoretically, I don't believe it's been tested lately), and visa 
versa.

I believe your understanding of parrot is somewhat at fault of 
confusion.  Perl doesn't increment a string.  Python doesn't increment 
a string.  A PerlString increment's itself, and a PythonString 
increment's itself.

It's possible that you're integrating code for a language that you 
don't have installed, so it may not be possible.  But cross language 
handling probably isn't the most explored part of parrot.  But most 
issues will be more a matter of assumptions regarding handling two 
languages at once than parrot's handling.  But don't forget, most 
people who use parrot will only use one language at a time.

Even if one doesn't implement increment on a string, it doesn't mean 
that the "slot" for increment is at the same place.

If a language is being compiled for parrot, the compiler author is 
obviously aware of parrot's abilities and potential.  A language may be 
implemented differently, but under the concepts that parrot is built 
upon, it won't use parrot's capabilities and potential to the fullest.  
Using Intel's ABI for a compiler may not be the best method for the 
given language, but it will help provide interoperability between other 
languages that use it, and benefit from advances Intel makes for 
improving that method.

I can write a program that would benefit greatly from cross language 
communication.  Say I wish to combine Perl with AppleScript to control 
my computer.  But if AppleScript doesn't support it, but Perl does, 
I'll have to use Perl to send data to AppleScript and to retrieve it.  
If my AppleScript program has weird subroutine names in it that Perl 
doesn't like, I can't call those subroutines.  But if I can call those 
subroutines, and send it a PerlScalar, I can get to do things with that 
variable in AppleScript as well as Perl.  Parrot will handle the 
PerlScalar, even in AppleScript, but I have to get it to cross the 
boundary between languages.  I will be able to join together two Perl 
strings from within AppleScript(although it'll probably return a Perl 
string instead of an AppleScript string).

This is only an example, and someone else can probably come up with a 
more valid example.

Vtables are the type.  It all comes down to being a Parrot type, using 
parrot's interface.

To create the scenario you are visioning, parrot would need to be 
extremely minimalistic, and all opcodes and pmc's would need to be 
loading via a dynpmc library and a dynop library, with no set 
definition of how to implement things.  Fortunately, "rules" exist!  
Rules are why Windows NT was a POSIX system as well to all the other 
types it is/was.  It aid's in the "it just works" idea that helps so 
many programmers in their code.

Crossing the language boundary is up to the language, handling the 
language boundary is largely up to parrot, and the programmer.

Don't increment a PythonString from Perl.  If you write your code to 
support cross language support, you won't have a problem.  But if you 
try to use cross language abilities with a function that doesn't expect 
it, you might have trouble.

Asking for the third element in a PerlString isn't possible, but 
perfectly normal in C.  There's the potential for a problem, but in 
many instances you'll be passing an array to something expecting an 
array rather than passing a string to something expecting an array.

The reasons programming languages exist are to aid development, namely 
speed of development.  The language used for a program is often a 
result of the features of the language.  PGE was written in PIR because 
it was easier than writing it in C.  This, at least at present, has a 
speed hit, but it made it easier to implement.

Suppose you want to mix Fortran with Perl 6.  Both have their 
advantages in coding for different aspects, so you choose to write 
different parts of your code in either.  You have quicker development 
overall, and few lines of code to debug.  Suppose you want Perl's regex 
combined with Java's IO groups, with Parrot it becomes possible.

I'll remember to require a string argument to every Perl subroutine I 
write and increment it just to forbid Python from using it.

If you don't intend it for cross language support, then don't care.  If 
you do intend it for cross language support, be more prudent about your 
choices for a language, and work with users of other languages to 
improve your library.

But you forget "zz"++ == "aaa" as in perl!

Anyway, wouldn't you much rather write i += "A"?  I know I would.  
There may be no need for the vtables, but otherwise you MUST know how a 
language implements a given function.  With vtables, you don't, parrot 
does.

Perhaps some confusion was caused.  Parrot has an Integer PMC, like 
java's Integer object.  Parrot also has an int type, which is quite 
simply an unsigned native integer, which has no more hit than in C.  If 
you're worried about your speed and memory footprint in java, you'll 
use int far more than Integer.

We have a Default, which others utilize.  Granted, parrot still uses a 
"macro" approach, but it works.  But as far as I know this is more 
implementation than design.  Parrot could have just one tiny base 
class.

Your computer behaves the same way, most likely.  Currently I 
use(although not as my "desktop") FreeBSD on AMD64, with 16 total 
integer registers and 16 floating point registers.  If I look at the 
disassembled output of a function with a large number of variables, I'm 
amazed at how few registers it uses, instead opting to constantly move 
data in and out of the stack(where local variables are stored).  In 
fact, this is how Parrot has be able to achieve "faster than c" status 
before, because data is kept in registers.

If a programmer really wishes to ensure that the code is jitable, then 
they'll need to look at the compiler output and the jit implementation.

But if you're looking at how to write your code to aid in jitability, 
you shouldn't forget how well your compiler optimizes for certain 
features, and how much of a hit certain assumptions about optimization 
can hurt your program, such as arrays of arrays.

The tricky thing is, if it's compiled to PBC, parrot's "ELF" as it 
were, you can't optimize for a particular platform.  Other than being 
open source, parrot doesn't provide any capacity for aiding a compiler 
with this at the moment, and a design hasn't been implemented, other 
than some odd(and probably unportable) use of NCI(native call 
interface) and ManagedStruct's.

Why not ask AMD why their processors are RISC processors, with a CISC 
interpreter as it were.

But consider a common function in cryptography.  Bitwise rotation is 
often used.  Both PPC and x86 have a rotate opcode, but C does not.  
Simple code such as "(a << b) | (a >> (sizeof(int)*8 - b))" will be 
compiled to the shifts and or that it specifies.  With a CISC vm, this 
can be JIT'ed to one opcode perhaps, because Parrot does have a rot 
opcode.  Instead of trying to match against a sequence of codes to turn 
into one, parrot provides that one opcode.

Your question was about extending parrot's features, not seeing if they 
exist.  The best method would probably be finding the current version 
of parrot, and going from there.  Once parrot reaches version 1.0, the 
bytecode should remain relatively constant.  New opcodes may be added, 
but older files will work regardless.  An older parrot may not run a 
new bytecode file, but as long as a new opcode or feature isn't 
expected, it should work find.  Given the fact that parrot isn't at 
version 1.0, these issues are theoretical.

Inline native assembly, doubtful.  But a language could support inline 
pir which could be jitted, which is a little bit close.  With NCI, 
which allows for calling a c function, the power of parrot can become 
massive.

It does, namely integers, floats, strings, and PMC's which are much 
like a pointer.

The same way C does, as a pointer.
