First, "§Ú" is comes with 2 bytes ASCII 167 + 218 in BIG5 coding. What I
would bet the
guess is the editor converted something before you run the code or
because you are on
a *nix platform ( since you heading your script #!/usr/bin/perl , so I
assume ) , however I
don't familiar with.

You may check if there's some Unicode or UTF-8 issues. in UTF-8, there's
3 bytes.
You may also check for other words and see if there's still in 3 bytes.

HTH,
Mug
