Lou Dobbs Tonight
Wednesday, June 20, 2007

Tonight, another showdown between President Bush and the
Democratic-controlled Congress: The President vetoed
legislation that would have expanded federal funding for human
embryonic stem-cell research. Will the Democrats try to
override the veto? We’ll have the full story tonight.

Visit http://cnn.com/loudobbstonight to read Lou’s
latest commentary on a legacy in search of a president: More
than 1.2 million students will not graduate public high school
this year. Somebody needs to fix our broken education system in
this country. Will the president assert real leadership?

And we’ll focus on the great equalizer tonight: Our public
education system is failing an entire generation of Americans.
We'll be live in Detroit, Michigan, where the high school
graduation rate is just below 25 percent, according to
Education Week. Is this a result of America's failed trade
policies? We'll have a special report, and we'll speak with
Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick.

We’ll also take a look at the factors influencing the poor
performance of public schools in Los Angeles.

A Bush administration plan that will allow Mexican trucks to
travel throughout the United States is facing opposition from
members of Congress and union groups. A public opinion poll
found that Americans think the Bush administration’s plan to
allow Mexican big rigs to travel beyond the border zone fails
to comply with federal safety requirements.  Is the Bush
administration defying Congress? We’ll have that report
tonight.

The Senate is preparing to take up the so-called grand
compromise on immigration reform again this week. Lou will be
joined tonight by two staunch opponents of that compromise:
Sen. Jim Demint and Sen. Jeff Sessions.

Americans’ approval rating of Congress has plummeted: A new
Gallup poll says Congress’ approval has sank to 24 percent.
We’ll have the story on what is driving down Americans’
approval of Congress.

Lou Dobbs lays out his manifesto to save the middle class in
his new book, “War on the Middle Class: How the Government, Big
Business, and Special Interest Groups Are Waging War on the
American Dream and How to Fight Back.” War on the Middle Class
is now on sale in bookstores near you and on Amazon.com and
BarnesandNoble.com.
