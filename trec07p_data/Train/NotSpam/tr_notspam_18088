And they look surprised when pointing a statistician at the chest of
drawers doesn't result in a cut price display worthy of Figleaf (or
Victoria's Secret I think for those of you in N.America) and get them
their degree, doctorate, latest publication ...

Ah me, how wonderfully, wonderfully ... sadly, accurate!

Thanks Ted, great thread and I'm impressed with EpiData that I've
discovered through this. I'd still like something that is even more
integrated with R but maybe some day, if EpiData go fully open source as
I think they are doing ("A full conversion plan to secure this and
convert the software to open-source has been made (See complete
description of license and principles)." at http://www.epidata.dk/ but
the link to http://www.epidata.dk/about.htm doesn't exactly clarify this
I don't think.  But I can hope.)

Thanks, yet again, to everyone who creates and contributes to the R
system and this list: wonderful!
