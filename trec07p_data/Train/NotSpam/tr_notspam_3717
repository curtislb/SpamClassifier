03:30 p.m., 04/20/07, Update: Outgoing station crew, space tourist Simonyi,=
 prepare for Saturday landing

Outgoing space station commander Mike Lopez-Alegria and flight engineer Mik=
hail Tyurin are gearing up for a day-late landing Saturday in Kazakhstan to=
 close out a seven-month mission. They will be joined aboard the Soyuz TMA-=
9 spacecraft by American businessman Charles Simonyi, who blasted off April=
 7 with the station's next full-time crew - commander Fyodor Yurchikhin and=
 Oleg Kotov. Yurchikhin and Kotov are scheduled to return to Earth in the F=
all.

"We have very mixed emotions about leaving, but it doesn't matter what we t=
hink - it is time," Lopez-Alegria told flight controllers in Houston early =
Friday. "I just want to pass on for the whole crew that we've had a blast. =
It's been a short seven months in a way, but it's time to come home and han=
d over the torch to the next crew, whom I'm sure will be up for the challen=
ge and continue the development and construction of the space station and a=
ll of the good things that are going on up here. It's been our pleasure."

"Speaking for everyone down here, it has been a double pleasure for us to w=
ork with (the) Expedition 14 crew and you," astronaut Shannon Lucid replied=
 from Mission Control.

Simonyi and the two Expedition 14 crew members originally were scheduled to=
 undock and return to Earth Friday, but soggy conditions at the northern Ka=
zakhstan landing zone prompted Russian mission managers to replan for a tou=
chdown in a more southerly zone. To get there, the crew had to delay their =
departure by one day to achieve the proper trajectory.

If all goes well, Lopez-Alegria, Soyuz commander Tyurin and Simonyi will cl=
ose the hatch to their re-entry vehicle around 2 a.m. EDT and undock at 5:0=
8 a.m. A four-minute 18-second firing of the spacecraft's braking rockets i=
s planned for 7:42 a.m. with landing on tap around 8:30 a.m. Here is a time=
line of re-entry activities (all times in EDT; dV means change in velocity;=
 dT means duration of event):

EDT...........EVENT

A veteran of three space shuttle flights totaling more than 42 days, Lopez-=
Alegria will set a new U.S. record for the longest single flight - 215 days=
 - when he lands in Kazakhstan. He now stands second in the world for most =
spacewalk time with 67 hours and 40 minutes during 10 excursions, five of t=
hem during Expedition 14.

Asked what he's looking forward to the most coming home and what he will mi=
ss most about living and working aboard the space station, Lopez-Alegria to=
ld CBS News "the sort of standard answer to the standard question is I'm go=
ing to miss floating around and I'm going to miss looking out the window. A=
nd all that is very true.

"But I think I'm going to miss the experience," he said. "As opposed to a s=
huttle mission where you come up here and you're full throttle for a week a=
nd a half, it's just been living up here. We certainly work hard when we're=
 working but we also have time to relax, we have a little bit more time to =
think about things. And I can say that I have lived in space, not just work=
ed, and I think I'm going to miss that sensation of just having this be my =
home."

One thing he will not miss is the daily exercise required to stay fit in th=
e weightlessness of space.

"One of the things that was a little bit more difficult for me than I antic=
ipated was the physical exercise part," he said. "We have a two-and-a-half-=
hour period scheduled every day and that's a lot more than I work out on th=
e ground and I just didn't expect a couple of the effects. ... It's just a =
lot of wear and tear on your body.

"It doesn't take very long at all for you to become quite deconditioned. Th=
ose were big surprises for me and it's obvious to me now that you really ha=
ve to approach that in sort of a slow and steady pace that you can maintain=
 throughout the six months. Mentally, it was very good testimony to how goo=
d our training is because I felt pretty prepared for the mission and as it =
unfolded, I sort of felt like I was not too far behind most of the time, wh=
ich was a little bit surprising as well. So the second message is the train=
ing community should be proud of the job they do preparing us for these lon=
g-duration flights."

Last December, the shuttle Discovery delivered a fresh station crew member =
- NASA astronaut Sunita Williams - who will remain aboard the lab complex w=
ith Yurchikhin and Kotov. She will return to Earth later this summer. Asked=
 if he thought it might be a bit strange to interact with more than three t=
o five people for the first time in many months, Lopez-Alegria said "I'll l=
et you know what it's like afterward."

"I have thought about it a little bit," said. "We interact with people quit=
e a bit up here, both the professionals in mission control in Houston and i=
n Moscow as well as in Huntsville (Ala.), but also friends and family via e=
mail and we have the IP (internet protocol) phone. However, we haven't real=
ly seen people and certainly not touched anybody in a long time and it's go=
ing to be interesting."

For his part, Simonyi, the fifth person to pay the Russians some $20 millio=
n for a flight to the space station, said in a video downlink the internati=
onal outpost "is just a fantastic place to live. It=92s cozy. It=92s compli=
cated. It has been lived in for quite a while."

Describing the station shortly after he arrived April 9, Simonyi said "I th=
ink that the most impressive thing would be the approach to the station and=
 seeing it from outside. Inside it's a very cozy place ... and I can see wh=
y Fyodor thinks it's his home. It is a cozy place, it's full of stuff as yo=
u see, nick-knacks just like a home is.

"But from the outside, it is amazing how it appears from the blackness of t=
he sky. We arrived at=A0 dusk, just between sunlight=A0 and darkness. It wa=
s very, very dramatic and it was like a big space set of a fantastic produc=
tion of some incredible opera or modern play. "

The decision to delay landing one day required significant replanning and r=
edeployment of flight surgeons and recovery crews. But officials said Frida=
y all is in readiness for the crew's return.

For entry, Lopez-Alegria will occupy the left seat of the Soyuz TMA-10 spac=
ecraft, vehicle commander Tyurin will work from the center seat and Simonyi=
 will strap in to his right. The spacecraft will undock from the aft port o=
f the Zvezda command module around 5:11 a.m. Here is an overview of landing=
 operations from NASA's Expedition 15 press kit, picking up at the point Ty=
urin undocks from the station:

-----------------------------

Source: NASA ISS-15 press kit

Six minutes after un-docking, with the Soyuz about 20 meters (66 feet) away=
 from the station, (Tyurin) will conduct a separation maneuver, firing the =
Soyuz jets for approximately 15 seconds to begin de-parture from the vicini=
ty of the station.

Less than 2.5 hours later, about 19 kilometers (12 miles) from the station,=
 Soyuz computers will initiate a deorbit burn braking maneuver. The ... eng=
ine firing will slow the spacecraft and enable it to drop out of orbit to b=
egin its re-entry to Earth.

Less than a half hour later, just above the Earth's atmosphere, computers w=
ill command the separation of the three modules of the Soyuz vehicle. The c=
rew will return in the descent module. The forward orbital module, containi=
ng the docking mechanism and rendezvous antennas, and the rear instrumentat=
ion and propulsion module, housing the engines and avionics, will pyrotechn=
ically separate and burn up in the atmosphere.

The descent module's computers will orient the capsule with its ablative he=
at shield pointing forward to repel heat buildup as the craft plunges into =
the atmosphere. For the first time in (seven months), Lopez-Alegria and Tyu=
rin will feel the effects of gravity during entry interface, three minutes =
after module separation when the craft is approximately 400,000 feet above =
the Earth.

Eight minutes later, when the Soyuz is at an altitude of approximately 10 k=
ilometers (six miles) and traveling at 220 meters per second (492 mph), the=
 ship's computers will begin a commanded sequence to deploy the capsule's p=
arachutes. First, two "pilot" parachutes will be deployed, extracting a lar=
ger drogue parachute, which stretches out over an area of 24 square meters =
(29 square yards). Within 16 seconds, the Soyuz's descent will slow to abou=
t 80 meters per second (179 mph).

Deployment of the parachute will create a gentle spin as the Soyuz dangles =
underneath the drogue chute, increasing the capsule's stability in the fina=
l minutes prior to touchdown. At this point, the drogue chute is jettisoned=
, and the main parachute is deployed. Connected to the descent module by tw=
o harnesses, the main parachute covers an area of about 1,000 meters (0.62 =
miles).

Initially, the descent module will hang underneath the parachute at a 30-de=
gree angle with respect to the horizon for aerodynamic stability. The botto=
m harness will be severed a few minutes before landing, allowing the descen=
t module to hang vertically through touchdown. The deployment of the main p=
arachute slows the descent module to a velocity of about seven meters per s=
econd.

Within minutes, at an altitude of a little more than five kilometers (3.1 m=
iles), the crew will monitor the jettison of the descent module's heat shie=
ld. That will be followed by termination of the aerodynamic spin cycle and =
dumping of any residual propellant. Computers also will arm the module's se=
at shock absorbers in preparation for landing.

When the capsule's heat shield is jettisoned, the Soyuz altimeter is expose=
d to the surface of the Earth. Using a reflector system, signals are bounce=
d to the ground from the Soyuz and reflected back, providing the capsule's =
computers updated information on altitude and rate of descent.

At an altitude of about 12 meters (39 feet), cockpit displays will tell Tyu=
rin and his crewmates to prepare for the Soft Landing Engine (SLE) firing. =
Just one meter (one yard) above the surface and seconds before touchdown, t=
he six solid propellant engines of the SLE are fired in a final braking man=
euver. The Soyuz touches down at a velocity of about 1.5 meters per second =
(3.4 mph).

-----------------------------

Flight surgeons and recovery crews will be standing by to help the returnin=
g spacemen out of the cramped Soyuz capsule and to render any assistance th=
at might be needed before the long flight back to Star City near Moscow for=
 reunions with friends and family members and the start of their physical r=
ehabilitation to cope with the unfamiliar tug of Earth's gravity.

While science was the original justification for the space station, NASA no=
w touts the lab complex as a valuable training ground and test bed for futu=
re flights to the moon and eventual missions to Mars. Asked how he viewed t=
he value of the station in that regard, Lopez-Alegria said "the most obviou=
s might be the scientific work we're doing up here to help understand the e=
ffects of long-duration microgravity on human physiology. I think that gets=
 enough play so I won't go into much detail on it.

"Also, if we're going to do anything internationally cooperative, we need t=
o learn how to work with our partners and that's quite a challenge day in a=
nd day out. We have learned a great deal with our Russian counterparts and =
in the next year or so we'll be doing operational things with the Europeans=
 and the Japanese as well through the control centers and the science cente=
rs.

"And lastly, I think we're starting to think about what we do up here opera=
tionally every day that may not be applicable to long-duration flights when=
 we're talking on to Mars, for instance, where the communication is going t=
o be a very big factor because we can't just expect to have a conversation =
like you and I are having right now. Just the mere speed of light limitatio=
n will make the communication take a long, long time between question and a=
nswer. So we've got to start thinking about how to operate autonomously.

"We haven't done much of that because we're still concentrating on operatin=
g the station, but I think in the future we could use it as a test bed to t=
ry that concept out, of how we might alter our operational concepts to adap=
t better to that lack of constant communication."

&quot;But from the outside, it is amazing how it appears from the blackness=
 of the sky. We arrived at=A0 dusk, just between sunlight=A0 and darkness. =
It was very, very dramatic and it was like a big space set of a fantastic p=
roduction of some incredible opera or modern play. &quot;<BR>
<BR>
The decision to delay landing one day required significant replanning and r=
edeployment of flight surgeons and recovery crews. But officials said Frida=
y all is in readiness for the crew's return.<BR>
<BR>
For entry, Lopez-Alegria will occupy the left seat of the Soyuz TMA-10 spac=
ecraft, vehicle commander Tyurin will work from the center seat and Simonyi=
 will strap in to his right. The spacecraft will undock from the aft port o=
f the Zvezda command module around 5:11 a.m. Here is an overview of landing=
 operations from NASA's Expedition 15 press kit, picking up at the point Ty=
urin undocks from the station:<BR>
<BR>
-----------------------------<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
Six minutes after un-docking, with the Soyuz about 20 meters (66 feet) away=
 from the station, (Tyurin) will conduct a separation maneuver, firing the =
Soyuz jets for approximately 15 seconds to begin de-parture from the vicini=
ty of the station.<BR>
<BR>
Less than 2.5 hours later, about 19 kilometers (12 miles) from the station,=
 Soyuz computers will initiate a deorbit burn braking maneuver. The ... eng=
ine firing will slow the spacecraft and enable it to drop out of orbit to b=
egin its re-entry to Earth.<BR>
<BR>
Less than a half hour later, just above the Earth's atmosphere, computers w=
ill command the separation of the three modules of the Soyuz vehicle. The c=
rew will return in the descent module. The forward orbital module, containi=
ng the docking mechanism and rendezvous antennas, and the rear instrumentat=
ion and propulsion module, housing the engines and avionics, will pyrotechn=
ically separate and burn up in the atmosphere.<BR>
<BR>
The descent module's computers will orient the capsule with its ablative he=
at shield pointing forward to repel heat buildup as the craft plunges into =
the atmosphere. For the first time in (seven months), Lopez-Alegria and Tyu=
rin will feel the effects of gravity during entry interface, three minutes =
after module separation when the craft is approximately 400,000 feet above =
the Earth.<BR>
<BR>
Eight minutes later, when the Soyuz is at an altitude of approximately 10 k=
ilometers (six miles) and traveling at 220 meters per second (492 mph), the=
 ship's computers will begin a commanded sequence to deploy the capsule's p=
arachutes. First, two &quot;pilot&quot; parachutes will be deployed, extrac=
ting a larger drogue parachute, which stretches out over an area of 24 squa=
re meters (29 square yards). Within 16 seconds, the Soyuz's descent will sl=
ow to about 80 meters per second (179 mph).<BR>
<BR>
Deployment of the parachute will create a gentle spin as the Soyuz dangles =
underneath the drogue chute, increasing the capsule's stability in the fina=
l minutes prior to touchdown. At this point, the drogue chute is jettisoned=
, and the main parachute is deployed. Connected to the descent module by tw=
o harnesses, the main parachute covers an area of about 1,000 meters (0.62 =
miles).<BR>
<BR>
Initially, the descent module will hang underneath the parachute at a 30-de=
gree angle with respect to the horizon for aerodynamic stability. The botto=
m harness will be severed a few minutes before landing, allowing the descen=
t module to hang vertically through touchdown. The deployment of the main p=
arachute slows the descent module to a velocity of about seven meters per s=
econd.<BR>
<BR>
Within minutes, at an altitude of a little more than five kilometers (3.1 m=
iles), the crew will monitor the jettison of the descent module's heat shie=
ld. That will be followed by termination of the aerodynamic spin cycle and =
dumping of any residual propellant. Computers also will arm the module's se=
at shock absorbers in preparation for landing.<BR>
<BR>
When the capsule's heat shield is jettisoned, the Soyuz altimeter is expose=
d to the surface of the Earth. Using a reflector system, signals are bounce=
d to the ground from the Soyuz and reflected back, providing the capsule's =
computers updated information on altitude and rate of descent.<BR>
<BR>
At an altitude of about 12 meters (39 feet), cockpit displays will tell Tyu=
rin and his crewmates to prepare for the Soft Landing Engine (SLE) firing. =
Just one meter (one yard) above the surface and seconds before touchdown, t=
he six solid propellant engines of the SLE are fired in a final braking man=
euver. The Soyuz touches down at a velocity of about 1.5 meters per second =
(3.4 mph).<BR>
<BR>
-----------------------------<BR>
<BR>
Flight surgeons and recovery crews will be standing by to help the returnin=
g spacemen out of the cramped Soyuz capsule and to render any assistance th=
at might be needed before the long flight back to Star City near Moscow for=
 reunions with friends and family members and the start of their physical r=
ehabilitation to cope with the unfamiliar tug of Earth's gravity.<BR>
<BR>
While science was the original justification for the space station, NASA no=
w touts the lab complex as a valuable training ground and test bed for futu=
re flights to the moon and eventual missions to Mars. Asked how he viewed t=
he value of the station in that regard, Lopez-Alegria said &quot;the most o=
bvious might be the scientific work we're doing up here to help understand =
the effects of long-duration microgravity on human physiology. I think that=
 gets enough play so I won't go into much detail on it.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Also, if we're going to do anything internationally cooperative, we n=
eed to learn how to work with our partners and that's quite a challenge day=
 in and day out. We have learned a great deal with our Russian counterparts=
 and in the next year or so we'll be doing operational things with the Euro=
peans and the Japanese as well through the control centers and the science =
centers.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;And lastly, I think we're starting to think about what we do up here =
operationally every day that may not be applicable to long-duration flights=
 when we're talking on to Mars, for instance, where the communication is go=
ing to be a very big factor because we can't just expect to have a conversa=
tion like you and I are having right now. Just the mere speed of light limi=
tation will make the communication take a long, long time between question =
and answer. So we've got to start thinking about how to operate autonomousl=
y.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We haven't done much of that because we're still concentrating on ope=
rating the station, but I think in the future we could use it as a test bed=
 to try that concept out, of how we might alter our operational concepts to=
 adapt better to that lack of constant communication.&quot;<BR>
