Thanks for the clarification.

   By the way, Bill C-47 (An Act respecting the protection of marks 
related to the Olympic Games and the Paralympic Games and protection 
against certain misleading business associations and making a related 
amendment to the Trade-marks Act) is currently being "debated" and will 
likely be passed in a few minuted.

   Another worrisome bill not for what it says, but for the potential 
precedent it might set.   There are possible positive outcomes, such as 
the possibility that Copyright could be amended to clearly allow parody, 
but it could also be negative in that other events may ask for similar 
exceptions from the due process that otherwise exists in the Trademarks Act.

   It is the whole slippery slope problem for both of these bills.
