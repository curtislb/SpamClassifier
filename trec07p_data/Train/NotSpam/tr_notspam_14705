The warning is harmless - R is just reporting that it has stopped the 
dynamically linked libraries resetting a flag that they should not change 
while R is running. If you followed the notes in README.windows in rgdal, 
you ought to be OK. There are no plans to provide more Windows binary 
drivers than those present now, because the others involve further 
external dependencies, which most users would not welcome. 

So please try to do an ogrinfo at the command line in Windows using
FWTools to your PostGIS data, and then the equivalent within R with your
locally built rgdal, and see how it goes. Even on Linux, getting all the
components lined up isn't easy, according to people who have tried, but
can be done if you need to do it.

Hope this helps,

Roger
