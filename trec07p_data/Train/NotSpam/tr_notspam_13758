Ariastis writes "[0]An open letter, posted by former EVE Players, levels
some new and serious accusations against CCP, the makers of the EVE
Online MMOG. In the letter, chat logs & event timelines, along with
description of in-game events from CCP-Approved reporting users, describe
how most of the big role-playing events are rigged to favor specific
alliances & players by CCP. More disturbingly, these users also appear to
have CCP employees 'on call', ready to step in on behalf of the favoured
players and alliances within the game. CCP reaction is member-only,
[1]but a forum thread has been left open to discuss about it." It should
be pointed out at the moment all of the evidence put forward is
circumstantial; take with a grain of salt. The issue of corruption in EVE
was addressed in our [2]interview with Magnus Bergsson at GDC.

An anonymous reader writes "The BBC is running a piece noting that the EU
is scrutinizing Google's privacy policy this month. The company's policy
of keeping search information on their servers for up to two years [0]may
be violating EU privacy laws. A data protection group that advises the
European Union has written to the search giant to express concerns. The
EU has a wide range of privacy protections that set limits to what
information corporations may collect and what they may or may not do with
it. In the US on the other hand privacy laws generally cover government
actions while the business sector remains largely unregulated. Is it
perhaps time to follow the European example and extend privacy laws to
include corporations?"

[0]nuts-to-CBS writes "After presenting 'Jericho' fans with a
cliffhanging season finale, CBS promptly cancelled the program. The
shocked fans quickly banded together, many using CBS' own public
"Jericho" discussion forum, and began brainstorming on ways to convince
the network to bring back the show for a second season. A plot point in
the final episode of "Jericho" involving the expletive "Nuts!" (in
reference to an historic conversation between generals) was turned into a
campaign to send large quantities of nuts to CBS' NY, LA, and affiliate
offices. Fans have sent a total of $26,000 for a pooled campaign hosted
at [0]Nuts Online to ship over 19,000 pounds of peanuts to CBS. Other
efforts acquired over $9,000 to publish full page advertisements in
[1]Variety (National Edition) and [2]The Hollywood Reporter for Tuesday,
May 29th. This is expected to become the largest ever fan campaign to
bring a television show back from cancellation." There's more about the
massive fan rollout below.

ultracool wrote with a link to a Science Daily article that requires that
you think long term. Really long term. Case Western Reserve University
physicists are theorizing that [0]trillions of years from now the
universe will become 'static'. Essentially, the information that we use
to gauge our Galaxy's position in the universe will have moved beyond the
'visible horizon. "What remains will be 'an island universe' made from
the Milky Way and its nearby galactic Local Group neighbors in an
overwhelmingly dark void ... The researchers followed up that discussion
with one tracking early elements like helium and deuterium produced in
the Big Bang. They predict systems that allow us to detect primordial
deuterium will be dispersed throughout the universe to become
undetectable, while helium in concentrations of approximately 25 percent
at the Big Bang will become indiscernible as stars will produce far more
helium in the course of their lives to cloud the origins of the early
universe."

[0]theodp writes "Robert X. Cringely speculates about [1]The Final Days
of Google, making a compelling case that when the end comes, it is going
to be an inside job. To find the founders of a Google-beating start-up,
Cringely suggests looking no further than the thousands of
entrepreneurial geniuses currently working for Google, who will
inevitably be driven to leave the company to realize the dreams of their
rejected ideas. 'The real money is in taking existing ideas and twisting
the idea just far enough to make it work in a fantastic new way. Think
Google vs. AltaVista; Apple vs. all previously existing laptops and mp3
players; YouTube vs. all previously existing video sites, etc. In
addition to ideas, you need creativity, resources, connections, and luck
-- none of which appear to be in short supply among Google worker bees.
Much of the next influx of ideas to Sand Hill Road will come not just
from former Google employees, but also from groups of former Google
employees who are planning their future companies over free sushi and
Diet Coke late at night in Google cafeterias.'"

week, Novell did as promised and [2]published details of its landmark
November 2006 Linux partnership agreements with Microsoft. Linux
advocates are expected to scour the documents for signs of how the
agreement may affect Linux and whether anything in it will put Microsoft
or Novell in potential violation of the upcoming version 3 of the GNU
General Public license (GPL). The GPL is used in licensing many
components of the Linux operating system. Open-source advocate Bruce
Perens said he would be looking to see exactly what Novell was given
through the deal and whether there is any requirement for the Linux
vendor to defend Microsoft's patent claims. 'What I'm actually looking
for is, to what extent was there a violation of faith?' he said."

which YouTube complied with — unfortunately, the video was copied to
several other sites. The NJTA still seems to be targeting YouTube since
YouTube 'did not try to prevent the very same video from being uploaded
again by users immediately after it was purportedly removed.' We'll have
to watch this closely and see if, even after you take down material
violating the DMCA, you are at fault to any extent for people who already

Kage-Yojimbo writes with a link to the site Strategy Page. There, they're
reporting on [0]a military adaptation of civilian wi-fi equipment to use
in boarding operations on the high seas. Modifications to normal
off-the-shelf gear can result in a range of over 700 meters, allowing
information to be passed through on-shore internet connections. "The main
reason for all this was to speed up the transmission of passport photos
and other personal data back to the ship, so that it could be run through
databases to check for terrorists or criminals. This wi-fi hack cut
several hours off the time required to check documents. The Expanded
Maritime Interception Operations (EIMO) wireless system was developed
last year, to provide several kilometers of range to the original wi-fi
gear (which has been in use for over three years). Each pair of wi-fi
units costs about $1400 to construct, using common parts to add more
powerful antennae to standard 802.11g wi-fi equipment."

of this museum almost becomes irrelevant as you are drawn into its
mixture of spectacle and narrative. Its 60,000 square feet of exhibits
are often stunningly designed by Patrick Marsh, who, like the entire
museum staff, declares adherence to the ministry's views; he evidently
also knows the lure of secular sensations, since he designed the Jaws and
King Kong attractions at Universal Studios in Florida. For the skeptic
the wonder is at a strange universe shaped by elaborate arguments, strong
convictions and intermittent invocations of scientific principle. For the
believer, it seems, this museum provides a kind of relief: Finally the
world is being shown as it really is, without the distortions of
secularism and natural selection. '"

Vexorian writes "Is there direct or indirect censorship in the media
towards delicate but important topics? Project censored lists 25 stories
that did not seem to [0]get the attention they deserved. Whether
intentionally or not, for the most part the media skipped over these
important topics. From the article: 'Throughout 2005 and 2006, a large
underground debate raged regarding the future of the Internet. More
recently referred to as network neutrality, the issue has become a tug of
war with cable companies on the one hand and consumers and Internet
service providers on the other. Yet despite important legislative
proposals and Supreme Court decisions throughout 2005, the issue was
almost completely ignored in the headlines until 2006.1 And, except for
occasional coverage on CNBC's Kudlow & Kramer, mainstream television
remains hands-off to this day'."
