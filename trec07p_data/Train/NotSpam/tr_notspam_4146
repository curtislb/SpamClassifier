This briefing note prepared by Doctors Without Borders - Medecins Sans
Frontieres (MSF) examines recent developments in Thailand in the context
of the second line HIV-AIDS crisis. It highlights MSFs experience treating
patients with HIV/AIDS in Thailand. This experience demonstrates the
importance of TRIPS flexibilities in ensuring access to essential
medicines. Given the unprecedented retaliation by Abbott Laboratories
against Thailand's lawful actions as well as other patent disputes
occurring internationally as a result of the use of TRIPS flexibilities by
developing countries we ask... what good are the flexibilities built into
international trade agreements if countries will be penalized for using
them?
