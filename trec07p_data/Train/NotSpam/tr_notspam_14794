amigoro writes "A device that specifically targets rapidly growing cancer
cells with intermediate frequency electrical fields [0]doubled the
survival rates of patients with brain cancer, according to an article
apperaring in PNAS. The device uses electrical fields to disrupt tumor
growth by interfering with cell division of cancerous cells, causing them
to stop proliferating and die off instead of dividing and growing.
Healthy brain cells rarely divide and have different electrical
properties than cancerous brain cells. This allows the device to target
cancer cells without affecting the healthy cells. Essentially no
device-related side effects were seenin the clinical trial."

Last Friday, we discussed [0]serious allegations leveled against CCP by
players of the game. The comments on the discussion were lively, and
pointed. Perhaps a bit too pointed, as CCP's internal affairs
investigation claims that [1]a plot to smear the company with false
accusations over the long holiday weekend was behind the flurry of online
activity. "The objective of this scheme was to permanently paint CCP as a
biased and corrupt company that favors a select group of players over the
rest of our community. In this particular case, instead of receiving
notification of a possible problem and sufficient time to examine and
address it, we faced a coordinated and hostile attack executed on our
forums, Digg, Wikipedia, Slashdot, and other outlets at the beginning of
a three-day weekend. We believe this speaks volumes of the intention of
the person(s) responsible for orchestrating this scheme. Verification of
this can be readily found on the forums of the people responsible--or at
least could, the last time we looked." Scott Jennings [2]over at Broken
Toys points the finger at [3]the Goon Fleet corporation, an organization
based out of the Something Awful forums. As I noted in the original post,
the evidence presented on both sides is challenging to verify
independently. Take everything you read about these events with a grain
of salt.

An anonymous reader clues us that the wildly litigious Canadian Wayne
Crookes, who has been [0]suing the Internet for defamation, has [1]added
Michael Geist to his hit list. Geist is a well-known Canadian law
professor and blogger. His offense: linking on his blog to site that
links to another site that contains material allegedly of a defamatory
nature. (Others would characterize that material as historical facts
about Crooks's tenure at the helm of the Canadian Green Party.)

[0]ReadWriteWeb writes in to tell us about an article by Dr. Riza C.
Berkan, founder and CEO of hakia.com, describing the [1]promise of and
potential for semantic search. This approach to providing more on-target
search results contrasts with the dream of the [2]semantic Web. Semantic
search doesn't require all the Web page authors in the world to begin
adding metadata; but it's not a sure thing that the researchers now
developing the idea will get it right.

Gamasutra reports that, despite the Wii's breakaway sales success,
[0]some analysts are skeptical of the Wii's staying power. Other analysts
are, of course, pointing out that many of the 'hardcore' titles are
expected later this year. "[They] not[ed] that 31% of Wii owners surveyed
in March said they expected to play the Wii more often a year from now,
compared to 21% of Xbox 360 owners." At the same time, Nintendo of
America's George Harrison is [1]questioning the staying power of Sony and
Microsoft. According to Harrison, the two larger companies 'lack the DNA'
to move with the industry, and keep with the the demand for casual, more
family-friendly titles. "'They're really good at reaching a certain
customer, and have a real difficulty understanding how we succeed with
the customers that we have,' said the senior vice president of marketing
and communications. With the sales of Wii and DS hardware crushing the
competition in the US, Harrison is confident that Nintendo could take up
to as much as 50 per cent of the market for this latest 'next-gen'
cycle."

[0]Bennett Haselton is back with another piece on e-mail privacy. He
starts "On April 14, 2007, I signed up for an AmeriTrade account using an
e-mail address consisting of 16 random alphanumeric characters, which I
never gave to anyone else. On May 15, I started receiving pump-and-dump
stock spams sent to that e-mail address. I was hardly the first person to
discover that this happens. Almost all of the top hits in a [1]Google
search for "ameritrade spam" are from people with the same story: they
used a unique address for each service that they sign up with, so they
could tell if any company ever leaked their address to a spammer, and the
address they gave to AmeriTrade started getting stock spam. (I don't
actually do that with most companies where I create accounts. But after
hearing all the AmeriTrade stories, I created an account with them in
April just for the purpose of entering a unique e-mail address and seeing
if it would get leaked.)" Bennett continues on if you're willing to click

The user experience is also mixed — on the one hand, the distribution
boots quickly, has great hardware support, and new, user-friendly
artwork. On the other hand, 'for some strange reason, the installed
Gentoo doesn't allow normal users to run any administrative
applications.' Overall, it doesn't look like Gentoo offers any compelling
reasons to switch to 'Secret Sauce' if they're happy with their current,

Helium may act as a [0]"throttle" for the solar wind. The team hopes that
this insight will provide them a better look inside the dynamics of space
weather. "Because helium nearly vanishes from the solar wind at its
minimum speed, the researchers believe helium might somehow set the
minimum speed. Helium is not accelerated efficiently by any process
thought to be propelling the solar wind. Instead, it has to be dragged
along by the hydrogen: Solar wind hydrogen atoms exert a small electric
field that drags the helium out along with it, according to the team."

"In It's Not News, It's Fark, Drew Curtis takes a critical look at the
mass media. He promises to examine why the news is often not news at all,
to look at the fear mongering, the cyclical nature of the news and the
fluff that is passed off as important. Drew breaks down these not-news
stories into 8 separate categories and gives examples, along with user
comments from Fark. Unfortunately, 230 of the books 278 pages (including
the index) are used for these examples. What time is spent talking about
the media and the advertisement model it is built on, is insightful a bit
cynical and very brief." Read below for the rest of the review.

An anonymous reader writes "Contrary to recent rumors, it's not Palm's
first Linux smartphone, and no, it's not a competitor to Nokia's
Linux-based N800 Internet Tablet. Rather, [0]Palm today unveiled the
Foleo, which it's calling a 'new class' of mobile device. The device is
designed to expand the email, Internet, and productivity application
capabilities of mobile phones such as the Palm Treo, by adding a
full-size keyboard and a larger screen. Company founder Jeff Hawkins
predicts that the Foleo will be more successful than Palm's original Palm
Pilot, which he designed, and more successful than its current Treo
smartphones. He touts its simplicity: 'Press a button, it's on. Press it
again, it's off. There are no other modes.'"

Alvis Dark writes "Apple [0]launched iTunes Plus earlier today, the fruit
of its agreement with EMI to sell DRM-free music. What they didn't say is
that all DRM-free tracks have the [1]user's full name and account e-mail
embedded in them. Is this to discourage people from throwing the tracks
up on their favorite P2P platform? 'It would be trivial for iTunes to
report back to Apple, indicating that "Joe User" has M4As on this hard
drive belonging to "Jane Userette," or even "two other users." This is
not to say that Apple is going to get into the copyright enforcement
business. What Apple and indeed the record labels want to watch closely
is, will one user buy music for his five close friends?'"

[0]seven of five writes "According to the recent Face Recognition Grand
Challenge, The match up of [1]face-recognition algorithms showed that
machine recognition of human individuals has improved tenfold since 2002
and a hundredfold since 1995. 'Among other advantages, 3-D facial
recognition identifies individuals by exploiting distinctive features of
a human face's surface--for instance, the curves of the eye sockets,
nose, and chin, which are where tissue and bone are most apparent and
which don't change over time. Furthermore, Phillips says, "changes in
illumination have adversely affected face-recognition performance from
still images. But the shape of a face isn't affected by changes in
illumination." Hence, 3-D face recognition might even be used in
near-dark conditions.'"

perfected a new method for [1]printing hidden fluorescent wording using
standard digital printing equipment. According to the company, the
discovery paves the way for customers and businesses alike to add an
additional layer of security to commonly printed materials such as
checks, tickets, coupons, and other high-value documents. The hidden
fluorescent words and letters show up only under ultraviolet light, said
Reiner Eschbach, a research fellow in the Xerox Innovation Group, and the
co-inventor of the patented process. What's more, the method for printing
them doesn't require the use of special fluorescent inks."
