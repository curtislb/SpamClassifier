Featuring Lutts' Logic:

Still High on Solar Power Stocks

Numbers, Words and Charts Working Together

A Very Big, Very Expensive Tunnel

-----

The Dow hit an all-time high yesterday.  The Nasdaq is just a stone's
throw from topping its February highs, though still far below its 2000
peaks.  All our Cabot trend-following market-timing indicators are
positive.  And all our measures of the market's internal strength reveal a
broad strong bull market.  In short, it's a great time to be invested. 
And the market's strongest sector is . . . solar power stocks.

But this is not an easy fact to learn from the traditional media.   
The problem is that the solar sector is so young and small that it's
lumped in with the broad "alternative energy" sector. Or, as our
institutional software program terms it, "Energy - Other."  And the fact
is, some of the stocks in that broad sector stink.  The companies they
represent are under-funded, or their technologies are just not in demand
by the market, so they drag down the group.

So the traditional media don't tell you that solar power is hot. They tell
that the Dow is at new highs, that Bristol-Myers' blood pressure drug may
be approved for wider use, and that J.C. Penney is going to open a store
in New York.  Useless information?  Probably.   

So you go to CNN and click on "hot stocks" and the first four headlines
are about IBM, Intel, JP Morgan Chase and Motorola.  Those aren't hot
stocks!

No, if you want to make really big money, you've got to buy stocks that
most investors aren't following.  And you've got to focus on the
fastest-growing stocks in the market today, like those in the solar power
industry.

Most of our Cabot publications are already recommending stocks in this
sector, and early investors are off to a great start.  But some newer
readers have asked me in recent days if there is a mutual fund or ETF they
can invest in instead, so that they can get the benefit of the sector's
strength but avoid the risk that comes from investing in just one or two
stocks.

Some, in fact, have found the one find most likely to do so - it's
PowerShares WilderHill Clean Energy (symbol PBW) - and asked what I think
about it.

So here you go.  WilderHill Clean Energy holds 43 stocks.  These include a
bunch of solar stocks, some fuel cell stocks, wind-power stocks,
chipmakers that make the brains for these machines, and more.  It's still
a small fund, and many of its holding are small companies - low priced -
because this is such a young industry.  The fund is just two years old and
overall, it's done a little better than the S&P 500.  Last year it
underperformed by 8% and this year it's ahead by 8%.

Looking at Morningstar, however, to get a picture of actual investor
returns (calculated by weighing the impact of cash flows in and out of the
fund), we see that while the fund gained 7.5% in 2006, the "average"
investor in the fund lost 14%.

Trouble is, the average investor puts money into the market after the
market is already up, and takes it out after the market is down.   

It's human nature, and it not only means that it's hard for the individual
investor to make money in the fund, it also means it makes it harder for
the fund manager to make money with his fund.  Ideally, he'd love you to
give him money at market bottoms, when bargains abound, and then take it
away at tops, when stocks are expensive.   

Better yet, he'd like you to simply leave it there year after year.   
But investors don't do that, especially when they're dabbling in hot funds
like this.

Bottom line.  If you're going to invest in a mutual fund, take care to buy
early in the uptrend, and sell when the trend is over, because these funds
can quickly take away your money when the trend turns down.

But better than mutual funds, in my opinion, is a concentrated basket of
stocks, chosen for their strength and their fundamental prospects, and
monitored carefully on a daily basis.

I've written about a number of the most attractive solar power companies
in recent issues, and the ones we're following most closely are First
Solar (FSLR) and Trina Solar (TSL).  These are not stocks for widows and
orphans; they can give fast and they can take away fast.  But their
long-term prospects are excellent given the enormous market opportunity
posed by the world's growing desire to curb fossil-fuel emissions, so we
think they're worth an investment . . . at the right time.  And sometimes,
timing is everything!

On a lighter note, I spent the past weekend playing 15 games of Scrabble
at a hotel in Westford, Massachusetts, at the 23rd annual Boston Area
Tournament (BAT), with 211 other like-minded souls, including many
national and world champions.

This is not your typical living room Scrabble game; it features timers
like chess, and we all have national rankings, just like chess players. 
But where chess is a universal game, Scrabble (obviously) is a
language-dependent game.  I play because it's fun, because I love words,
because I'm competitive, and because in this group I can play against
people of similar abilities.

This time, I won 9 games and lost 6, and here are my best plays: PETULANT
for 72 points, GEEZERS (dumping three Es) for 51 points, DECORATE for 65
points, BONNIER for 66 points, QANAT (a wonderful U-less Q word) for 34
points, RELATERS for 59 points, ARMBAND for 78 points, ERADIATE for 63
points, OUTRIDE for 77 points, LEISURE for 65 points, ISOBAR for 27
points, DESCENT for 76 points, TOURIST for 75 points and RERAISE for 63
points . . . a woman who wasn't a poker player challenged that one!

And how is this related to investing?

Well, over years, I've observed that there are word people, chart people
and number people.  Sure, most of us speak all three languages, but we all
have our strengths and weaknesses.  My strength, noted above, is words.  I
like charts a lot, too.  And my weakest suit is numbers.

My father's strength is charts.  I remember him poring over the chart
books published by Securities Research for hours at a time, finding
promising new stocks by hunting for strong RP (relative performance)
lines.  RP is at the heart of our Cabot Top Ten system, and that's a great
place to find new investment ideas.  But my father doesn't pore over chart
books any more; he now uses TeleChart and WONDA; these online products are
always up to date, while his old chart books - published monthly - were
out of date before they arrived in the mail!

Roy Ward, editor of Cabot Benjamin Graham Value Report, is a numbers guy. 
He doesn't love any individual stocks; he loves the numbers that guide his
decision-making process.  (I love the great results this cold, calculated
method brings.)  Roy recommended American International Group, for
example, back in December, when it was 70, writing, "AIG shares have
declined by 30% from their all-time high and now sell at only 11.5 times
forward (next 12 months) earnings.   
We highly recommend you purchase AG at current price levels in
anticipation of achieving our Min Sell Price of $116.32 within two to
three years."

I remember that I liked reading that, and not just because of the numbers.
 I liked the fact that AIG, which is America's largest insurance company
and has a great long-term growth record, was being shunned by investors
for two temporary factors.  The first was hurricane-related losses.  The
second, touching a far more emotional chord in investors, was the misdeeds
of long-time president Hank Greenberg, who didn't play by the rules, got
caught by the SEC and the Attorney General of New York, and was forced out
as president in February 2005.  The final chapter in that story came in
February 9, 2006, when AIG paid a fine of $1.6 billion.

People still loathe Greenberg today, and, by extension, his old company. 
But AIG is clean as a whistle, and working hard to stay that way.

Which brings us to the final piece of the puzzle, the chart.  A long-term
view reveals that AIG has been building a long base since 1999 hovering
around the 70 level.  That base has become tighter in recent years, and
this year I've been encouraged to see the stock find support at its 50-day
moving average, which is now at 66 and rising slowly.  In fact, I've just
seen five big days of buying, coincident with the Dow's recent strength.

Conclusion: AIG not a hot stock yet, and may never be, but I think it can
be a very good stock.  Roy says it's a great value, contrary opinion says
there's great room for investor opinion to improve, and the chart shows
signs that the smart money is already buying.

Numbers, words and charts, all adding up to what I think is a good buy on
an important American company.

Finally, a very big idea, with some very big numbers.  An arm of the
Russian government yesterday unveiled a plan to build a tunnel between
Siberia and Alaska under the Bering Strait, explaining that it could carry
Russian oil, natural gas and electricity to the U.S.   
The cost . . . $65 billion!  Interestingly, the tunnel itself would cost
only $10 to $12 billion; the bulk of the money would go towards building
railways between both ends of the tunnel and existing transportation
facilities.

The idea is not new; but while earlier motives have been political, the
motive this time is economic, and that means it has a chance of going
through.

I remember when the "Chunnel" under the English Channel was built, a
process that lasted from 1984 to 1994.  In fact, I was attracted the stock
of Eurotunnel when it came public, reasoning the tunnel would accelerate
commerce between England and France, and thus make a lot of money for
shareholders.  But I was wrong.  What happened were delays, cash
shortfalls and mismanagement.  In the end, the cost of the tunnel was six
times original projections (no surprise to those of us in Massachusetts
who watched the cost overruns of Boston's Big Dig).  But traffic today is
just one-third original projections.

Eurotunnel has already been through restructuring once and is now in
danger of falling into bankruptcy again.

Bottom line: If you get a chance to invest in this new Russian venture, I
suggest you decline.
