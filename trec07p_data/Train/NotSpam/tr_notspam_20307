Score One Inc.
SREA
$0.29 UP 45%

SREA announced its plan to develop a $75 Million project duplicates a
successful plan in 2006 than returned over $100 million in profits.
Investors are getting in fast. Read the news and get all over SREA
Tuesday!

You in know way are forced to buy it.
doc format for ISO certification?

It was a delicate balance to strike between functionality and overall
size. Most of the rest of us like having a couple of options. Go get a
good job and buy it.

Although it will be hard to implement of course just like ODF is.
BALD-FACED LIE: "ODF is hard to implement.

I also think that the controller if garbage. Just imagine how much
interoperability we could have in the world if we simply could
standardize more formats. Anyway, ODF is not that easy to implement
without looking at OpenOffice messy source code, just ask the guys at
AbiWord.
What are they afraid of? Likewise, many offenders are ones who fall into
an authority figure category, such as teachers, youth group leaders,
religious ministers and the like, who have some relationship with the
victims.

Why should we stop at MS-OOXML?

He also admitted that the Nintendo Wii had broad appeal to consumers,
and acknowledged his success.

About the Wii,  give me a break.
Not to mention that the introduction of VB. let's face it if your a
convicted sex offender your life is over, might as well kill yourself.
"Just as the automobile can co-exist with the airplane, ODF and Open XML
can and should co-exist, the team writes.

There is a perception that the vast majority of sex offenders will
repeat their crimes. They want recurring income. In that case, I do
wonder whether standardization is the most appropriate way, and
shouldn't you look to some of the other tools that you have available to
you, to address interoperability? Hopefully ISO will not ratify OXML as
a standard.
Only when customers demand that vendors meet a standard will compliant
products be produced.
Yes a PC costs more but I would use a keyboard and mouse solution if
given the chance. The object of that yet-to-be Microsoft-implemented
functionality within it's own packages, to ensure that an author using a
Microsoft tool to publish a document has the widest possible audience.
Open Microsoft Expression Blend.
If we have that, the competition will be much better, and end-users will
greatly benefit from it. In order to use the functionality, the user
must log in and create a "travel map" that shows the places he has been.

A port of OpenOffice for god sake.
Conversion is what they do. MS has done nothing but make improvements to
their console.

Other systems have had a steady stream of titles since launch. Clearly,
some things have been factored out of the .

Merging Library and Developer Centers.

Every application, could have its own standard format, or maybe two or
three. More choices is good.

That's what we are trying to refine," he told the Financial Times on
Thursday.

Yes it looks nice but the game is just BORING.
I can't wait to hear your wailing and screaming when MS-OOXML gets
rejected in September. I think there should be a death penalty or life
imprisonment for men and women who do this.

"More from our interview with Tom Robertson, general manager of
interoperability and standards at Microsoft, later in BetaNews.
Research studies by the US Dept. We are dealing with human beings,
therefore each and every one is different.

And KOffice also does not use ODF if your document are complex, and will
ask you to save in their own format especially in word processing and
presentation. The company says that in real world situations, consumers
typically rely on travel advice from their friends anyway, so
TripAdvisor is taking that concept and applying it to its business.

Should I instead take your methodology of simply cutting and pasting the
testimony from the latest "experts"?
A port of OpenOffice for god sake. The Wii is not HD capable and does
not have DVD. In order to use the functionality, the user must log in
and create a "travel map" that shows the places he has been.

How many Microsoft employees does it take to change a light bulb? Those
stalking parks and cyberspace are actually quite the minority.
