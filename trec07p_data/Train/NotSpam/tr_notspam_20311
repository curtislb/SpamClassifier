It's handy to not have to reload packages that don't change between
versions of the basic installation.

I don't exactly have issues.  It's not a huge problem I'm dealing
with.  It's simple enough for me to use update.packages() as a user
which will download the appropriate packages.  Though they won't be
installed, they are all in the one place in the /tmp/ directory from
where I can install them as root.  I just thought there must be a more
elegant way to set permissions so that users could write to the
subdirectories under /usr/local/R-2.xxx/.  So much of the installation
process of R and its packages is so elegant, I'd like to retain some
of that elegance.
