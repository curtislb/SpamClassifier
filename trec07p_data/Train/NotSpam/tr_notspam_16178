Well, I am not really recommending debian but I would think it would be the 
easiest thing for you to use since you're currently using ubuntu. If you 
switch to suse or fedora core you'd  have to relearn some things. Installing 
packages, starting & stopping services, and configuring networking area all 
the same in debian and ubuntu. But all those things are different in suse 
and fedora.

It's become a cliche but as it turns out, the best distro is the one that is 
best for you.
