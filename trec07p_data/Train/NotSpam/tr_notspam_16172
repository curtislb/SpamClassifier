That's good to hear. However, the X properties required now are more  
complex than before. In the case of Squeak, at window creation time I  
have no way of knowing the dbus activity id yet.

To show the icon it's sufficient to know the bundle id. Actually, you  
don't even really need that, because the icon is already showing  
(flashing). You just need to know if this is an activity window or  
not. And if it is, then sooner or later the dbus service will appear  
telling you if that window belongs to this activity.

It's practically the same whether you announce the dbus service via X  
props, or you send the XID via dbus. Supporting both makes activity  
developer's live easier.

That icon would not even be visible because it is hidden by the X  
window that just appeared. It is noble to try preventing to create  
that icon unnecessarily, but if I had a say in designing Sugar, I'd  
opt for robustness, making it simpler for external developers, not  
harder.

In fact, if I launch an activity from the Sugar frame, it's  
reasonable to assume that the next X window opened actually belongs  
to that activity. So you don't really need to show that raw icon, at  
least until the activity launch is finished.

Which isn't really relevant to Sugar, is it?
