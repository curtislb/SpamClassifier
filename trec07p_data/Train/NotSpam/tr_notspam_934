OK, this is my attempt to rephrase clause 5d in a form that is weak
enough to be less harmful than clause 2c of GPLv2:


~~~~~~~~~~~~ begin proposed text ~~~~~~~~~~~~

     d) If the Program has interactive user interfaces which display
     legal notices, this feature must be preserved in each interactive
     interface that is also present in the work.  In this subsection, an
     interactive interface is said to "display legal notices" if it
     includes a convenient feature that displays an appropriate
     copyright notice, and tells the user that there is no warranty for
     the work (unless you provide a warranty), that licensees may convey
     the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this
     License.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~ end proposed text ~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Constructive critics and suggestions are welcome.


For reference, here's clause 5d of GPLv3draft3:

|    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must
|    include a convenient feature that displays an appropriate
|    copyright notice, and tells the user that there is no warranty for
|    the work (unless you provide a warranty), that licensees may
|    convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this
|    License. Specifically, if the interface presents a list of user
|    commands or options, such as a menu, a command to display this
|    information must be prominent in the list; otherwise, the
|    work must display this information at startup.  However, if the
|    Program has interactive interfaces that do not comply with this
|    subsection, your work need not make them comply.

and clause 2c of GPLv2:

|    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
|    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
|    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
|    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
|    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
|    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
|    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
|    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
|    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
|    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
