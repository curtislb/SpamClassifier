This makes it GPL incompatible, but I think it's still DFSG free.

The GPL says:

"""
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.
"""

So if you redistribute the Program, you may not impose any further=20
restrictions. Obviously others, like Debian, could not add additional=20
restrictions. However, assuming RedHat is not using parts of GPL software=20
in their fonts, they are free to add addition restrictions the their=20
originally licensed software--as they copyright holders, they can use any=20
license they want.=20

So if they say their fonts are GPL+restriction, the fonts are NOT GPL=20
compatible, but as long as the restriction itself is DFSG free, the work as=
=20
a whole should be fine.=20

The restriction they've added itself is very GPLv3-esque, so I don't see wh=
y=20
it wouldn't be DFSG free[1].

[1] Cue someone who will point out a billion reasons why they think similar=
=20
clauses in GPLv3 drafts aren't DFSG.
