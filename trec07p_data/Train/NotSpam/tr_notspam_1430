I'm not sure Pugs does that right. The file named "0" (zero) seems to
behave inappropriately. In this example, "foo" and "0" are real files,
and "not there" is not a file that exists:

pugs> "foo" ~~ :e
"foo"
pugs> true "foo" ~~ :e
Bool::True

pugs> "not there" ~~ :e
Bool::False
pugs> true "not there" ~~ :e
Bool::False 

pugs> "0" ~~ :e
"0"
pugs> true "0" ~~ :e
Bool::False

Again, I don't really mind whatever the answer is as long as I can
document it. :)
