						<div class=3D"GreyHeading">INSIDE SPORT PRESENTER GABBY LOGAN</div>
						<div>Hello everyone, Gabby here.
<br>

<br>
Tonight is our last Monday show and we've been working on a very special ed=
ition of the programme. Our reporter, Garry Richardson, has been following =
referee Graham Poll in what has turned out to be his last season.=20=20
<br>

<br>
You'll remember it was Poll who made one of the most public refereeing mist=
akes in history, giving three yellow cards to the same Croatian player at t=
he World Cup Finals last year.=20
<br>

<br>
It was not long after that error that we began to follow him.=20
<br>

<br>
The really interesting thing about the documentary is that you see a very d=
ifferent side of Poll - he's viewed by many as an arrogant man who likes to=
 be the centre of attention on the pitch. But we show you the other side of=
 the man, the private side, the side that has doubts - so you can judge him=
 for yourself.
<br>

<br>
* He relives the moment he found out he'd made that mistake at the World Cu=
p Finals and how it motivated him to keep going.
<br>

<br>
* He gives his view of the season-long controversy between him and Chelsea =
manager, Jose Mourinho.
<br>

<br>
* He explains why he sent off Everton's James McFadden and how disappointed=
 he was by Everton's repsonse.
<br>

<br>
* He gives his side of the story of when he sent off Chelsea and England ca=
ptain, John Terry.
<br>

<br>
*He admits match officials made a mistake that led to a crucial goal agains=
t Charlton at Christmas last year.
<br>

<br>
*He criticises the FA for not protecting referees against players and manag=
ers enough and says much tougher action needs to be taken against those who=
 misbehave.
<br>

<br>
* And he tells us what he was feeling just after he had refereed his last e=
ver professional game - the play off final last Monday.
<br>

<br>
It's a gripping watch - well worth staying up for.
<br>

<br>
So join me for Inside Sport at 2305 BST, BBC ONE.
<br>

<br>
