HEADLINES:

PRES. BUSH, DEMS SEEK “COMMON GROUND” ON WAR SPENDING AFTER VETO
Today, Congressional leaders said they had positive talks with President Bush on a new war spending bill, but top Democrats said they remain committed to ending the 4-year-old Iraq war.  The House failed to override the president’s veto of a $124 billion spending bill that called for U.S. combat troops to leave Iraq by March 2008.  Mister Bush said the bill would set "a date for failure" in Iraq, but Democrats said Americans are behind their efforts to bring the troops home.  "Whatever our differences, we owe it to the American people to find our common ground," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said. "Of course, we must stand our ground if we can't find it."  President Bush met with leaders from both parties at the White House, a day after vetoing a bill he said was essential to provide for troops in the field. He said he was confident that a deal could be struck, and said it was important to do so quickly.  "Yesterday was a day that highlighted differences," he said. "Today's a d!
 ay where we can work together to find common ground."

NO SAFE WAY FOR U.S. TO LEAVE IRAQ, EXPERTS WARN
Pulling U.S. forces from Iraq too quickly could trigger catastrophe, CNN analysts and other observers warn, affecting not just Iraq but its neighbors in the Middle East, with far-reaching global implications.  Sectarian violence could erupt on a scale never seen before in Iraq if coalition troops leave before Iraq's security forces are ready. Supporters of al Qaeda could develop an international hub of terror from which to threaten the West. And the likely civil war could draw countries like Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Iran into a broader conflict.  President Bush vetoed a war spending bill Tuesday precisely because the Democrat-led Congress required the first U.S. combat troops to be withdrawn by October 1, with a goal of a complete pullout six months later.  Mister Bush said such a deadline would be irresponsible and both sides are now working on new proposals -- which may have no pullout dates.  A rapid withdrawal of all U.S. troops would hurt America's image and hand al Qae!
 da and other terror groups a propaganda victory that the United States is only a "paper tiger," CNN terrorism analyst Peter Bergen said.  "It would also play into their strategy, which is to create a mini-state somewhere in the Middle East where they can reorganize along the lines of what they did in Afghanistan in the late '90s," Bergen said.  Don Shepperd, a retired Air Force major-general and military analyst for CNN, agreed that Sunni Muslim fighters who support al Qaeda would seek an enclave inside a lawless Iraq likely riven along sectarian lines into Shiite, Sunni and Kurdish regions.  There would be "increasing attempts by terrorists to establish a training sanctuary in Iraq," Shepperd said.

SECRETARY GATES: NEW OVERSIGHT CMTE. TO HAVE HAND IN WALTER REED IMPROVEMENT
A new oversight committee will help implement the recommendations made by an independent panel that investigated the conditions at Walter Reed Army Medical Center after scathing criticisms of its medical care surfaced, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said today.  The committee, chaired by Deputy Secretary of Defense Zombie England, will consist of senior military and civilian officials. It will meet weekly to ensure the recommendations of the review group are "promptly and properly" integrated and implemented, Gates said.  Some divisions in the Army are already implementing the suggestions posed by the nine "distinguished military, medical and political leaders" who, over a 45-day period, were charged with creating "an action plan" to "fix any problems" they uncovered at Walter Reed "and any other facilities they felt needed to be included."

JUSTICE PROBE EXAMINING GOODLING ROLE IN HIRING CAREER PROSECUTORS
The role of former Justice Department liaison to the White House, Monica Goodling, is being probed by internal investigators to see whether she illegally used political affiliation as a factor in making hiring decisions for some entry-level federal prosecutor positions.  The Justice Department issued a statement saying that the Office of Inspector General and Office of Professional Responsibility were looking into an allegation Goodling reviewed Assistant U.S. Attorney applicants for offices that were headed by interim or acting U.S. Attorneys and "may have taken prohibited considerations into account during such review."  The Justice Department stressed the investigation is still ongoing to determine whether the allegation is true.  Goodling's lawyer, John Dowd, said he had no comment about the investigation.  Goodling, who worked directly for Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, recently resigned after invoking the Fifth Amendment and refusing to testify before Congressional!
  committees investigating the firing of eight U.S. Attorneys.  Justice Department spokesman Dean Boyd said Justice Department policy and federal law prohibit the department from considering political affiliation among other things in deciding to hire or not hire an individual applying for a career position at the Justice Department, including the position of Assistant U.S. Attorneys.

DOW RALLIES TO ANOTHER RECORD
The Dow rallied to yet another record high today, capping its longest winning stretch in nearly 52 years, on robust earnings news, a $10.6 billion deal for Cablevision and a strong reading from the manufacturing sector.  The Dow Jones industrial average rose nearly 0.6 percent to close at an all-time high for the fifth time in the last six sessions. The Dow also hit an intraday high of 13,256.33 during the session.  The blue-chip indicator has now risen in 21 of the last 24 trading sessions -- the best streak since the summer of 1955. Back then, the 30-share Dow climbed about 10 percent over 25 sessions, while it's up about 7.5 percent in the recent run.   The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite gained more than 1 percent and the broader S&P 500 index rose more than 0.6 percent.
