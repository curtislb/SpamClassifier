Try this out, there are some changes to the other post.

#!/usr/bin/perl -w

use strict;
use File::Copy;
use Time::Local;

my $destination_folder = "cgi-bin\\"; # path to destination folder
my $source_folder = "C:\\Programming\\test_bed_perl\\"; #path to
source folder

# add extensions to select those files for copying eg. *.pl would
select file with .pl only. Can select
# multiple extensions ("*.*, *.pls)
my $file_extensions = "*.pdf";

my($day, $mon, $yr) = (localtime)[3, 4, 5];
my $daily_folder = $day . "_" . ($mon + 1) . "_" . ($yr + 1900) ."\\";
# check epoch if you are going to use date as dir name (UNIX $yr + 30
i think)
my $start = timelocal(0, 0, 0, $day, $mon, $yr);	# 00:00 this morning
my $stop = $start + (24 * 60 * 60 ) - 1; # 23:59:59

chdir $destination_folder or die "cannot change dir";
mkdir "$daily_folder";
print "directory created: ${destination_folder}${daily_folder}\n";

grep {
	if ($_ ne $0){
		copy("${source_folder}$_", "${destination_folder}${daily_folder}$_")
or die "Could not copy source file: $!\n";
		print "copying ${source_folder}$_ -> ${destination_folder}$
{daily_folder}$_\n";
		unlink("${source_folder}$_") or die "Could not delele source files:
$!\n";
		print "deleting ${source_folder}$_\n\n";
	}
} @{&find_files};

sub find_files{
	my @files;

	chdir $source_folder;
	grep{
		my $timestamp = (stat $_)[9];
		push @files, $_ if  $timestamp >= $start && $timestamp <= $stop;
	} glob $file_extensions;

	return \@files;
}

edit the $destination_folder and $source_folder to the directories you
want the files moved to and the original location of the uploads. you
can also edit $file_extensions if you want to filter for a specific
extension eg. ".pdf".

Can you give me an indication of what you want to do with the opened
pdf?
