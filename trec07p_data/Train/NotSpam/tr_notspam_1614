Ah, I'll give it a try. I added those single quotes
based on an early R-list posting  suggesting that the
space in "Program Files" was a problem. 

Actually by that time I was down to superstitious
learning but the idea seemed reasonable.

Oh I see what you mean.

I am not sure either but I suspect that SAS does not
tollerate such new-fangled things as USB sticks. Try
it on a USB and see what happens.  Things seem to work
just fine on a hard drive.  Currently I am blaming the
problem on SAS's outdated view of the world :) .

Most of my SAS (as opposed to R problems) seem to
disappear when I move the files to the C: drive.
Something I should have thought of sooner.

Thanks, you have been very helpful already.  Stand by
for the difficult questions :)
