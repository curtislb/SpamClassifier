<B>Coming up this Sunday on Reliable Sources: </B>

<B>Dan Rather vs. CBS</B>

Dan Rather's comments this week that CBS had been "dumbing down and tarting up" the news set off a war of words between Rather, CBS Chief Executive, Les Moonves, and CBS Evening News' Executive Producer, Rick Kaplan.  Are Rather's comments simply sexist sour grapes towards the network who let him go, or does he have some legitimate criticism of CBS?

<B>Too Much Iraq Coverage?</B>

After a report by the Project for Excellence in Journalism showed that Fox News was devoting far less time to the Iraq war than rivals MSNBC or CNN, Bill O'Reilly charged CNN and MSNBC with showing violence in Iraq simply to make President Bush look bad.  He also took aim at the authors of the report.  Is there such a thing as too much Iraq coverage?  We'll analyze the charges.

<B>CNN/YouTube Debates</B>

With the Internet becoming an integral part of the Presidential Campaign, CNN is joining forces with YouTube to host the next Presidential debates. We'll tell you how that will work. Also, "Obama Girl," is the latest sensation affecting the campaigns, in the new age of viral video are candidates losing control of their images?

<B>Plus, </B>Democratic Strategist Bob Shrum has been spinning the media for decades.  He opens up about why he may not have always been honest with the press.  And Paris Hilton claims she will start using her media spotlight for good causes, should we believe her?

<B>Join us this Sunday and every Sunday at 10am ET / 7am PT for our critical look at the media! </B>
