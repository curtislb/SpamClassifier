So, has A Swarm of Angels decided to go with a CC license that would be the 
art equivalent of the OSD? (less any source code requirements) If so, I think 
I would like to contribute.

I thinkthe license might be a bit confusing. The confusion might arise due to 
names for the two (one?) projects.

If there are indeed two projects:

ASWAM: A Swarm of Angels Movie
ASWAD: A Swarm of Angels Documentary

Then I think you could clear up the possible confusion by beaing clear which 
is which in the text.

I hope that is clear and helpful.
