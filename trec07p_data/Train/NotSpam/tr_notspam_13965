Firstly, /always/

  use strict;
  use warnings;

after which you wil have to write

  my @arr = @hash{'jeevan', 'sarika'};

instead. You will find it resolves a lot of simple problems without you
having to ask for help.


You are using a /slice/ of the hash data. Look at

perldoc perldata

(find for the section titled 'Slices')

If you access a single element of the hash, you use a dollar sign like the
scalar variable prefix:

  $hash{'jeevan'}

If you want to access multiple elements at the same time, resulting in a list
of values, you must use an at sign, like the array variable prefix:

  @hash{'jeevan', 'sarika'}

using a percent sign, as in %hash{'jeevan', 'sarika'} is meaningless as the sign
in this context doesn't denote a variable type but a mode of accessing the data,
and must be either $ if you're indexing a single element or @ if you want multiple
elements.

HTH,

Rob
