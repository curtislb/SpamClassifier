Cancer Rates Rising in Africa

Voice of America News
Wed, 05/16/2007

15 May 2007 -- Another African epidemic is taking the spotlight, cancer.
Experts say aging and infectious diseases are increasing Africa's cancer
burden. A new non-governmental group is trying to raise global awareness
of the problem and held a meeting recently in London that brought
together African health ministers and other interested participants.

"Unless we start taking action now to make a difference, then the
existing health infrastructure in Africa is going to be overwhelmed by
the coming increased cancer incidence coming down the road," said
University of Oxford cancer physician David Kerr. "By 2020, it is
projected there will be 15 million new cases of cancer every year and 70
percent of these will be in the developing world. In Africa by 2020, we
expect there to be more than 1 million new cases of cancer every year."

David Kerr says cancer survival rates in poor countries are often less
than half those in industrial nations. In Africa, he says, cancer is a
sentence to a painful and distressing death, because treatment and care
are lacking.

That is why he has begun Oxford University's Africa-Oxford Cancer
Consortium, called AfrOx, and organized a recent two-day international
conference in London to raise global awareness about the issue. The
meeting included 23 African health ministers, leading African medics,
world-renowned cancer specialists, officials of the World Health
Organization and development banks, investment bankers, and the Gates
Foundation.

Kerr says the conference issued a London Declaration.

"This sets out some very simple precepts that say that we, the global
cancer alliance, the global community, must support African health
ministers to start preparing for cancer," he added.

The London Declaration set out a plan of action for African cancer care.
It calls for vaccination against tumor-related infections, early
diagnosis and screening, access to modern cancer treatment, and easing
the pain of dying, now often medicated only by aspirin instead of
stronger painkillers.

"We do need to bring some additional resources to bear, but it need not
be a huge amount of money. Some of the curable childhood cancers can be
treated for $1 a day," he said. "So although there are new cancers drugs
that are terribly expensive, we would start building the pyramid from
the bottom and we could use so-called generic drugs, which are available
cheaply."

Kerr says the cancer conference declaration is being presented at the
annual World Health Assembly of national health ministers now under way
in Geneva and will be discussed at an African Union health ministers
meeting in August. He is hopeful that it will stimulate more global
attention and financial support to fight cancer in Africa.
