Ravengbc writes "I am in the process of planning and buying some hardware
to build a media center/media server. While there are still quite a few
things on it that I haven't decided on, such as motherboard/processor,
and windows XP vs. Linux, right now my debate is about storage. I'm
wanting to have as much storage as possible, but redundancy seems to be
important too." Read on for this reader's questions about the tradeoffs
among straight HDDs, RAID 5, and JBOD.

$2500 to buy Adobe's premium suite and, frankly, shouldn't need to
because there should be competitive products on the market. But I can't
seem to locate software for graphic design and printing that outputs CMYK
files that printing companies will accept. And I'm not familiar with any
products that are better than FrontPage yet still easy to use for Web
design. Any suggestions? Our company is notoriously frugal and would
certainly entertain the idea of using open source products if we could
implement them in a way that doesn't infringe upon our Microsoft-centric
hegemony / daily work tasks in XP."

[0]opeeeerah sends us to Gundeep Hora's review of the [1]Wing, the first
Windows Mobile 6 OS-based smartphone from T-Mobile. He concludes:
"Microsoft's Windows Mobile 6 is a disappointment. Working with a number
of applications or 'heavy' documents was painful. The delay was too much,
especially in Word and PowerPoint... All in all, the T-Mobile Wing is...
a decent smartphone. If nothing else, it's an interesting gadget for the
young and hip crowd, though we wouldn't recommend it for productivity
hounds that are looking to do reports and presentations... Not to
mention, the sexy and strange appeal of the device can't be pleasing to
serious professionals. For $299.99 from T-Mobile, it's a worthy Sidekick
replacement."

[1]dropped its longstanding case against disabled single mother Tanya
Andersen in Oregon, [2]Atlantic v. Andersen. The [3]dismissal (pdf)
relates merely to the RIAA's claims against Ms. Andersen, and does not
relate to her (a) claim for attorneys fees or (b) counterclaims against
the RIAA, which are presently before the Court on a [4]motion to dismiss.
The counterclaims were first interposed in [5]December 2005. This is the
same case in which the RIAA [6]insisted on taking a face to face
deposition of a 10 year old girl. Prior to the case, neither the mother
nor the child had ever even heard of file sharing."

Fox. The court said the U.S. Federal Communications Commission was
'arbitrary and capricious' in setting a new standard for defining
indecency. 'Republican FCC Chairman Kevin Martin angrily retorted that he
found it "hard to believe that the New York court would tell American
families that 'sh*t' and 'f@ck' are fine to say on broadcast television
during the hours when children are most likely to be in the audience ...
If we can't restrict the use (of the two obscenities) during prime time,
Hollywood will be able to say anything they want, whenever they want,"
Martin said in a statement.' No word yet on whether the agency will
appeal.

form of hardware warranty what-so-ever. The news has only recently hit
Dell's own IdeaStorm website, via a forum post describing an interaction
with the company's customer service. Says the customer, 'I am looking for
protection from bricks. The laws of physics do not differ from one OS to
the other...do they?' After so recently decided to support Linux on their
machines, including limited technical support, Dell seems to be
squandering any possible good-will with this decision to leave purchasers
of these machines high and dry for hardware warranty coverage." Update:
06/05 23:40 GMT by [2]KD : many readers let us know that Dell has said
that the omission of extended warranty and CompleteCare options from the
configurator for Ubuntu systems was an "[3]ordering system glitch." It
should be fixed by now according to DesktopLinux.com.

'terminator genes' that would prevent seeds from germinating after a set

every year instead of saving the seeds from last year's crop. The
legislation is not expected to pass due to opposition from the
Agriculture Minister. 'There is also an issue with the technology, which
is based on a complicated five-gene construct. It is "inevitable" it will
fail and could harm biodiversity, said Lucy Sharratt, co-ordinator of the
Canadian Biotechnology Action Network, which backs the ban. CFIA argues
exactly the opposite, saying "the terminator approach provides an
excellent method to protect against transference of novel traits to other

[0]54mc writes "The IFPI, an international recording industry
organization, has released a list of [1]Ten "Inconvenient Truths" of file
sharing. Though the group has a vested interest, it's still an
interesting read as it tears apart some of the most common arguments in
favor of file sharing. Ars Technica follows up with a more thorough
explanation of some of the points. 'Point five is an attempt to turn the
"innovation" argument on its head. For years, pundits outside the music
industry have accused labels of pandering to teens through boy bands and
"manufactured" celebrities instead of being concerned with finding,
producing, and releasing art. The IFPI suggests that the labels could
(and would) be doing exactly that if file-swapping went away. And then
there's point seven, which isn't an "inconvenient truth" at all but more
of a rant against those who prefer giving copyright holders less than
absolute control over reproduction rights. An "anti-copyright movement"
does exist, but most of the critical voices in the debate recognize the
value of copyright--and actually produce copyrighted works themselves
(Lawrence Lessig, etc.).'"

holy_calamity writes "The [0]Large Hadron Collider is in trouble again.
It will start work [1]sometime in spring 2008, not November this year as
planned. The delay has been blamed on an 'accumulation of minor
setbacks,' and comes on top of a 'design fault' that saw breakdown of
magnets supplied by the competing Fermilab. Yesterday Slate nicely
rounded up [2]increasingly loud rumors among physicists that Fermilab may
already have seen the Higgs particle, the 'holy grail of particle
physics' the LHC was build to find."

Threaded writes with news from Ars that [0]Intel has announced major
updates to its C++ and Fortran tools. The new compilers are Intel's first
that are capable of doing thread-level optimization and
auto-vectorization simultaneously in a single pass. "On the data
parallelism side, the Intel C++ Compiler and Fortran Professional
Editions both sport improved auto-vectorization features that can target
Intel's new SSE4 extensions. For thread-level parallelism, the compilers
support the use of Intel's Thread Building Blocks for automatic
thread-level optimization that takes place simultaneously with
auto-vectorization... Intel is encouraging the widespread use of its
Intel Threading Tools as an interface to its multicore processors. As the
company raises the core count with each generation of new products, it
will get harder and harder for programmers to manage the complexity
associated with all of that available parallelism. So the Thread Building
Blocks are Intel's attempt to insert a stable layer of abstraction
between the programmer and the processor so that code scales less
painfully with the number of cores."

[0]Killam0n takes note of a story in CNN Money on [1]progress in
controlling computers via brainwaves. From an aspirin-sized implant a
quadriplegic is now using to play computer games, the article
extrapolates out to a near future in which we will all be wearing
headband computers and IM'ing one another as if telepathically. "Two
years ago, a quadriplegic man started playing video games using his brain
as a controller. That may just sound like fun and games for the
unfortunate, but really, it spells the beginning of a radical change in
how we interact with computers — and business will never be the same.
Someday, keyboards and computer mice will be remembered only as
medieval-style torture devices for the wrists. All work — emails,
spreadsheets, and Google searches — will be performed by mind control."

[0]Anarchysoft writes "In an exciting shift from previous statements,
Apple CEO Steve Jobs revealed at the D Conference that [1]3rd-party
development will be supported on the iPhone. Questions remain as to
whether the opening of the platform, slated for later this year, will be
through Dashboard-like widgets or a separate SDK."

[0]Josh Levin, Slate Magazine writes "I have a magical box that allows me
to [1]watch other people watch TV — their movies, their sports, their
cartoons, and their hour-long procedural dramas. And sometimes, usually
around 11:30 on Friday nights, their soft-core pornography... I solved
the mystery by consulting online message boards. At techie sites like AVS
Forum, other voyeurs described their adventures in freeloading. I was
intercepting video-on-demand channels through the power of my Samsung's
QAM tuner."
