Rather than matching, you might control for season by fitting a periodic 
spline of your 'Stratum' variable. If you do that, then a generalized 
additive logistic regression model could be used.


Something like

fit <- gam( cbind( Cases, Conceptions - Cases ) ~ te( Stratum, bs="cc" ) +
 		te( t, bs="cs" ) + Pollution, your.data.frame,
 		family=binomial )

see ?gam, ?te
