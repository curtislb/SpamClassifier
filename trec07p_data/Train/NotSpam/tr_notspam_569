Hello sm1lies,

Today marks the start of the Microsoft Connected Services Framework Assembly Competition Series.  $7,500 is up for grabs!

Microsoft Corp. and BT Group PLC, in association with TopCoder(R), will run a series of Connected Services Sandbox Mashup Service Design and Assembly competitions.  The competitions encourage participants to create "network mashups" that merge telecommunications features such as voice and text messaging with Web 2.0 applications like mapping and search.

In the Assembly stage of the competition, which opens today, developers create a prototype for a mashup idea which came out of the first design competition. 

Prizes will be awarded to the top three mashup assembly submissions for a total prize purse of $7,500.  Check out all of the contest details at http://csf.topcoder.com/. 

Best of luck to you in the CSF Competition Series!
