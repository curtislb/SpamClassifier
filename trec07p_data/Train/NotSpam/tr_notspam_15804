I don't think that's meaningful; if I sue you in a court in Australia
for not complying with debootstrap's license, and they find that you've
infringed the license, it doesn't really matter if I'm doing that out
of maliciousness or a genuine. And as far as the actual effects go,
I'm not sure you're going to be any better off without that clause in
your license: if you set foot in Australia, with an Australian judgement
against you, there's a good chance of it being enforced; and if you don't,
there seems to be a practical possibility of your extradition anyway,
based on [0].

Simon Phipps' argument, presented at debconf last year, is (aiui) that
the clause only comes into play when both parties are organisations
that cross multiple jurisdictions anyway -- in which case they're both
presumed to have a presence in the given jurisdiction anyway, and could
reasonably be expected to be following its rules, afaics.
