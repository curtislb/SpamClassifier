The find utility has been included for a while and I think we could get the author of that one to help.

The Rtools footprint from the command line utilities isn't a problem. 
The size comes from Perl and MinGW.  This really isn't an issue.

I've just been trying out pp.  I couldn't get it to build with 
ActivePerl (I don't have the MS compilers installed), but I did get it 
built in Strawberry Perl, which uses MinGW.  It converts each of our 
Perl scripts into an .exe of about 2.5 MB (self-contained) or 1.4 MB 
(depending on perl58.dll, which is about 1.1MB).  I believe we have 10 
Perl scripts that would need converting, so this would add about 15 MB 
to the footprint.

That's a size that is feasible, but wasteful, because there's a lot of 
duplication in these .exe's, with copies of all the Perl modules they 
use.  Perhaps some additional work could reduce their size, or we could 
follow Gabor's suggestion and compile them into one big .exe instead.

Which would you think would be easier?
