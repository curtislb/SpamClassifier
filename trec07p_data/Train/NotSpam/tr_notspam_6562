Which is no worse than other general schemes in high dimensions or 
without smoothness assumptions on the integrand.

Your reference for this result, please.  (As stated it is untrue, so I 
presume the stratification scheme depends on N and there are smoothness 
assumptions.)  (BTW, the reference for the results I quote is 'Stochastic 
Simulation' (1987).)

We have not been told 'me' and 'sig', and depending on their values it is 
quite possible that importance sampling would do a great deal better than 
sampling from the specified bivariate normal.

This is a correlated bivariate normal, and product quadrature methods can 
be arbitrarily bad for such integrals (as people find out for mixed linear 
models).

What you can do is transform to a pair of uncorrelated normals, and for a 
set of the form A as given this transforms to a similar form.  And for 
that an iterated integral can be done easily as the inner integral over y 
will just be a call to pnorm.

Specifically, there is another normal z such that x and z are independent 
and y = z + a*x for some a.  Then A = {x > 0 & z < (3-x)*x + 10} can be 
integrated over z conditional on x and then over x.
