It looks like the idea of moving listener-involvement
further back on the music-development timeline is
gaining steam. You're trying it with Strayform, Amie
Street is doing something along those lines, and
Marillion has also been trying it with their recent
releases. All the while, the bands bypass the
middlemen by default, pooling the listeners' money
together to build their own cash advances. The
difference being that a well-established act like
Marillion can go it alone, while newer and smaller
bands would need the support of some sort of
aggregator like Strayform...very clever! It'll be
interesting to see how the various licensing schemes
being employed by each will contribute to their
individual success.
