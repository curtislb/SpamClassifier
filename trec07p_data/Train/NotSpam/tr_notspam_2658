Ok, then I would suggest moving that out of the first sentence and
into a new paragraph. "The above exception only applies for the
situations described in Exhibit Z". Then you can write an Exhibit Z
for your own trademark(s).

Right. My problem with that is that Z can change over time, but
the definition of Z won't change with that.

Suppose Debian becomes a free hardware company too. The license
would still refer to software only, as it was written before
that happened. Then can I use the sign Debian to promote my
proprietary hardware company? The license only said I couldn't
create confusion with the software parts of Debian.

Ehm, you can't do *that* in a trademark license. You can only complain
if people use X to create confusion in relation to *you*.

Saying "don't create confusion with anyone" goes beyond what you
are allowed with your trademark.

Anyway, in summary I think it could work to have some Z in there
but I also think an exhibit is better. That at least avoids the
impression that Z has to fit in (one part of) a single sentence,
which probably is too short for most cases.
