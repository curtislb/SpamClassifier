I am really hoping you might be able to help me because I'm not sure
where else to turn.  I am trying to extract information from an Oracle
database into an Excel Spreadsheet for individuals to view and I think
I'm lost. =20

=20

Project:  When someone logs into an admin area of a site, they would
like to click on a link that says "Get Data" and when clicked on, I
would like for an excel file to be created with the necessary
information.

=20

Below is the Perl file I've written to accomplish this task and well it
doesn't work.  I would prefer not to use a module if possible because I
do not own the server and asking someone to install it would be very
difficult.

=20

In advance, thanks for any help you can offer!  I'm desperate!

=20

CODE:

#!/afs/isis.unc.edu/pkg/perl-582/bin/perl

=20

  use Spreadsheet::WriteExcel::FromDB;

=20

   use Spread

sheet::WriteExcel::FromDB::Query;

=20

  my $dbh =3D
DBI->connect("dbi:Oracle:oracle.xxx.xxx",'username','password',

           { RaiseError =3D> 0, AutoCommit =3D> 0, LongReadLen =3D> =
16384 } )
||

           &do_error("Logging in to database: $DBI::errstr");

=20

  $query =3D q{'SELECT dateadded, totalpeople, miles, totalsaved FROM
OWNER.Conference ORDER BY dateadded'};

  my $ss =3D Spreadsheet::WriteExcel::FromDB->read($dbh, $query);

=20

#  my $ss =3D Spreadsheet::WriteExcel::FromDB->read($dbh,
$Owner.Conference); #  $ss->include_columns(dateadded, totalpeople,
miles, totalsaved);

=20

  print $ss->write_xls('savings.xls');
