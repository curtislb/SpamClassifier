There is no need to send this to the list, so to all of its many
subscribers. Send it to the list owner, see the headers of each list
message about how to reach her.

Yes, other people get these annoying "bounces" too, and I already asked
the list owner at least twice to do something about it (the best way
being to remove anyone related to objectorb.com from all Perl related
mailing lists).

If more people would do that, let's hope that the list owner will act
upon it, at last.
