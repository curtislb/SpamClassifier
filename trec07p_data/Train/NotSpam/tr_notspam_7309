Dear Reader,



This special theme issue <http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/5/en/index.html>  of the Bulletin is timed to coincide with a resolution on tuberculosis (TB) control to be considered the 193 Member States of the World Health Organization at the World Health Assembly from 14 to 23 May.



Léopold Blanc & Lindsay Martinez introduce this theme issue on TB control <http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/5/en/index.html>  with an editorial on the importance of the two key targets <http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/5/07-041996.pdf>  of 70% detection of TB cases and successful treatment of 85% of those cases. In another editorial, Mario C Raviglione calls for successful implementation of the Global Plan to Stop TB and the Stop TB strategy.



In the news section, Jacqui Wise reports on how new technology could hold the key to keeping extensively drug-resistant TB <http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/5/07-010507.pdf>  at bay in southern Africa. Elena Zolotova reports from the Russian region of Orel on progress in fighting TB strains <http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/5/07-010507.pdf>  that are resistant to common drugs. Paul Garwood writes about promising new vaccine, drug and diagnostics candidates <http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/5/07-010507.pdf>  for TB that could soon be within reach. In this month's interview, Jorge Sampaio, the United Nations' first special envoy to Stop TB <http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/5/07-100507.pdf> , talks about his work campaigning for TB control.



Dermot Maher et al. argue that their TB control planning approach to help countries achieve Millennium Development Goal 6 <http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/5/06-037820.pdf>  has relevance for other health areas. Robert Matiru & Timothy Ryan found that provision of free or affordable TB drugs by the Global Drug Facility <http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/5/06-035402.pdf>  was not always an incentive for governments to improve their TB programmes.



Katherine Floyd et al. look at a global financial monitoring system for TB control <http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/5/06-034942.pdf>  that was established in 2002. John C Ridderhof et al. write that investments in new equipment and supplies <http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/5/06-039081.pdf>  for laboratories should be accompanied by efforts to integrate TB laboratory networks into health-care systems. Roland Brosch & Véronique Vincent outline current research efforts <http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/5/06-035386.pdf>  to produce new TB vaccines, drugs and diagnostics.



Kai Blöndal tackles the subject of drug resistance <http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/5/06-035345.pdf>  and the challenges this presents for TB control. KF Laserson & CD Wells debate the impact of HIV on TB control. Donald A Enarson & Nils E Billo take a critical look at the DOTS Expansion Plan <http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/5/06-035378.pdf>  for TB treatment.



Christopher Dye et al. assess whether national TB control programmes <http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/5/06-037580.pdf>  met the 2005 targets. Mudleke J van der Werf & Martien W Borgdorff discuss whether we can be confident about data being used to measure progress towards the Millennium Development Goals <http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/5/06-039941.pdf> . Pieter van Maaren et al. describe how the Stop TB Special Project established in 2000 helped to achieve substantial gains in TB control in WHO's Western Pacific Region <http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/5/06-038521.pdf> .



In this month's Public Health Classic section <http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/5/07-041756.pdf> , Mukund Uplekar & Mario C Raviglione review a ground-breaking 1966 paper by Halfdan Mahler, WHO Director-General from 1973 to 1988, on tuberculosis programmes in developing countries that was published in the Bulletin of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease.



The WHO-recommended TB control strategy includes supervised administration of treatment under proper case management conditions, or directly observed treatment. Critics advocate eliminating supervised administration <http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/5/06-038927.pdf>  from TB treatment guidelines, substituting self-administration or family treatment observation. But Thomas R Frieden & John A Sbarbaro argue that this advocacy is based on misinterpretation of scientific data and failure to rigorously analyse public health practice.



Paul Garner et al. cite the failure of TB patients to complete their treatment <http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/5/06-035568.pdf> , even in places where health services are good, as a major obstacle for TB control. They call for new approaches to overcome the stigma of TB and to tackle gender differentials in TB treatment.
