Thank you Prof. Ripley.

Believe me, I do not have the skills to contribute such a thing as a  
stream compressor and I DO appreciate the work and usefulness of the  
pdf device as it is. I do most of my plots with pdf device, the rest  
with quartz (especially when I'm not sure I'll want to save a plot)  
and (rarely) png when the pdf output is too large or for  
compatibility with microsoft applications.

I find the statement you took from the help page promising: I often  
include these large plots into LaTeX, so I'll investigate what form  
of compression pdftex can do.

Sincerely,

Denis
