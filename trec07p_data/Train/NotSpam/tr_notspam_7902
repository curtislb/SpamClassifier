That is of great relief, thank you. I was wondering how the installer actually 
dealt with setting up encryption. I cannot find any documentation on the 
procedures it takes, as I know that there are different (optimal and not so 
optimal) ways of setting up LUKS.

Did you also use LVM2 by any chance? I would actually like to have both LVM2 
and LUKS if possible.

Thank you very much for that explanation. It is great news to know that the 
Debian developers created such a fine installer.

I really hope my mileage will not vary! I am really worried of the 
installation working and even suspend and hibernation working correctly but 
then one day, whether due to upgrade or whatnot, hibernation fails, corrupts 
swap and upon resume, corrupts my data.
