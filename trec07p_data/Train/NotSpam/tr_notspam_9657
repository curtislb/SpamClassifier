An anonymous reader passed us a link to an Ars Technica article about
[0]a failed lawsuit over a Google search. A federal circuit court of
appeals has upheld the original ruling against David Mullins, who claimed
that Googling his name constituted ex parte communications prior to
firing him. "Through a series of events, Mullins' employer found that he
had misused his government vehicle and government funds for his own
purposes — such as sleeping in his car and falsifying hotel documents to
receive reimbursements, withdrawing unauthorized amounts of cash from the
company card, and traveling to destinations sometimes hundreds of miles
away from where he was supposed to be ... Mullins' supervisor provided a
23-page document listing 102 separate instances of misconduct. Mullins
took issue with a Google search that Capell performed just before
authorizing his firing. During this Google search, Capell found that
Mullins had been fired from his previous job at the Smithsonian
Institution and had been removed from Federal Service by the Air Force."

alternative to Windows, it is not cheap Windows. Linux has its own
strengths, and users should want it because of those strengths and not
because it's a cheap copy of Windows ... Often we see proprietary
software companies just completely fail to understand not only the
motivations of the Linux community, but also the processes. It's very
practical, there's a way to get things done, and it's different. The
VMware guys have really engaged with us completely and worked to the
agenda set by the Linux community, which is not an ideological agenda but
a practical one.' Does that mean Wine won't even be listed in the package
manager?"

| Some Truth to Wii as GameCube 1.5?                                 |

Newsweek's N'Gai tackles the allegation that [0]the Wii is a glorified
GameCube. He specifically looked at recent comments by Microsoft's Robbie
Bach saying that 'the video graphics on it aren't very strong; the box
itself is kind of underpowered; it doesn't play DVDs; there are a lot of
down-line components [that] aren't actually that interesting. ... They
don't have the graphics horsepower that even Xbox 1 had. So it makes sort
of the comparison set a little bit difficult.' LevelUp spoke with a pair
of technical experts at third party publishers and learned that,
essentially, Bach's comments about horsepower are accurate. However, "the
'Gamecube 1.5' moniker, while accurate, doesn't mean that gamers won't
see graphical improvements on the Wii. 'There are three main differences
which will result in graphics improvements. One, the increased memory
clock speed, from 162 megahertz to 243 megahertz, means that it is easier
to do enough pixels for 480p mode versus 480i. Two, the enhanced memory
size of the Wii gives much more room for image-related operations such as
anti-aliasing, motion blur, etc. The performance to these memory systems
from the graphics chip is also improved. So full-screen effects and
increased texture usage seem likely as a result.'"

This causes your brain to engage in a tug of war as it fights to filter
and ignore the noise. The result is slower reading speeds and decreased
comprehension. The company has developed a product that automatically
re-formats text in a way that your brain can more easily comprehend."

that [0]global warming might make life on Earth better, not just for

are often the result of inaccurate simulations made in the 1980s. While
climate change is a reality, as far as the article is concerned, some
planning and forethought may mean that more benefits than drawbacks will
result from higher temperatures. From the article:'The medical benefits
of higher average temperatures have also been ignored. According to
Richard Tol, an environmental economist, "warming temperatures will mean
that in 2050 there will be about 40,000 fewer deaths in Germany
attributable to cold-related illnesses like the flu." Another widespread
fear about global warming -- that it will cause super-storms that could
devastate towns and villages with unprecedented fury -- also appears to
be unfounded. Current long-term simulations, at any rate, do not suggest
that such a trend will in fact materialize.'"

An anonymous reader writes "In 2001, Rusi P. Taleyarkhan shocked the

Dr. Taleyarkhan said last night in an e-mail message that the

simm1701 wrote us with a BBC article link on [0] a sort of artificial
blood substitute being developed by an English university. The substance
is light, can survive at room temperature, and keeps longer than real
blood, allowing it to be used as a stand-in in emergency situations. "The
new blood is made up of plastic molecules that have an iron atom at their
core, like haemoglobin, that can carry oxygen through the body. The
scientists said the artificial blood could be cheap to produce and they
were looking for extra funding to develop a final prototype that would be
suitable for biological testing ... A sample of the artificial blood
prototype will be on display at the Science Museum in London from 22 May
as part of an exhibition about the history of plastics."

An anonymous reader writes "The US house of representatives today passed
a bill [0]outlawing illegal domestic wiretapping by the government. Now
government agencies are only allowed to access your private
communications under terms of [1]FISA. 'As the Senate Report noted, FISA
"was designed . . . to curb the practice by which the Executive Branch
may conduct warrantless electronic surveillance on its own unilateral
determination that national security justifies it." The Bill ends plans
by the Bush Administration that would give the NSA the freedom to pry
into the lives of ordinary Americans. The ACLU noted that, despite many
recent hearings about 'modernization' and 'technology neutrality,' the
administration has not publicly provided Congress with a single example
of how current FISA standards have either prevented the intelligence
community from using new technologies, or proven unworkable for the
agents tasked with following them.'"

[0]Staska writes "A new [1]Apple patent filing shows new directions for
Apple's touch interface design. For smaller devices like iPod Nano,
touchscreen interface may not be feasible — the screen is just too small
for touch operation. According to the patent, Apple can still make full
screen iPods and put a touch panel on the backside of the device with
transparent controls on the front screen. In addition to iPod, patent
filing also describes controls for the phone. ZDNet even thinks that
[2]this patent can hint about future touch interfaces for all Apple

An anonymous reader wrote with a link to the official Planet Quest site.
Planet Quest has the goal of exploring the galaxy via sophisticated
instrumentation for another habitable planet. NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab
is working to plan out missions for the project, and researchers are now
theorizing that [0]the instruments may be able to explore the system of
40 Eridani. Hardcore Trek fans may know 40 Eridani as the star associated
with the planet Vulcan. "The SIM PlanetQuest instrument will be so
accurate, it could measure the thickness of a nickel at a distance from
Earth to the moon. Using a set of mathematical models based on Newton's
Laws, Tanner was able to conclude that SIM would be able to definitively
determine whether there is an Earth-mass planet orbiting in the habitable
zone around 40 Eridani A, and could also determine its orbit. This is
quite an exciting prospect, since NASA's Terrestrial Planet Finder
mission, planned for launch after SIM, would not only be able to take a
rudimentary 'picture' of the planet, but also could search for signatures
of life such as methane and ozone."
