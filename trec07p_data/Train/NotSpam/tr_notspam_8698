If I've already defined the sub, with a name, presumably in a namespace, and 
marked it with :vtable, why do I have to play the games by getting a Class 
PMC and calling methods on it?  I presume in this case I also have to 
*remove* it from the namespace if I don't want it to be there too, right?

That does not seem like an improvement over the current approach where merely 
putting the :vtable attribute on a subroutine does the right thing.
