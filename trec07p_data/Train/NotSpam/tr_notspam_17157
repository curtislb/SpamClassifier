Only part is on my end*.

I have to apologize again. I was right the first time. Something of 
significance with respect to Google Groups and beginners[at]perl.org 
happened on May 25th.

Before May 25, no messages with an "NNTP-Posting-Host" header appeared 
on this list. After May 24, such messages started to appear, and *all* 
of them have a User-Agent of "G2/1.0" (Google Groups).

I've placed a CSV file and an Excel worksheet on my website; they 
demonstrate the timing of the change:

http://home.earthlink.net/~mumia.w.18.spam/msgs3.csv
http://home.earthlink.net/~mumia.w.18.spam/msgs3.xls

I hope that the list managers can stop Google's messages from making it 
to the mailing list.

* I was looking at my archive of debian-user when I concluded that there 
was no problem (Doh!)
