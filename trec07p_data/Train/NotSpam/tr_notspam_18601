Sorry Evan, that came over like I'm an "APE man", lol :)  Lossless codecs
were the recommendation, not specifically APE.  I get great results from
both, when compressing track exports for other collaborators.  FLAC makes
most sense for a web site wanting to cater for all, thanks for helping clear
that up.

I didn't get chance until now to also backup Drew's interesting idea of
sharing a "project" file.  The only trouble with this is that you'd need to
make sure folks all had the same software, and be careful not to use any
hardware specific plugins (DSP audio card processing etc).  As Drew said, a
live (RT kernel) linux distro (with disk writing support) could provide an
interesting platform from which to launch such a project.

This is getting a little OT, but I wonder if anyone else onlist feels it may
make an interesting CC promo project if we (as a group) teamed up with a
distro like UbuntuStudio or Dynebolic (both of which offer a good range of
apps) to start some sort of community open-audio project, "open" from the
"tools up" ??

;)

I like FLAC, but it seems like APE is a proprietary, single-platform
format.

I think open formats are best for open content.
