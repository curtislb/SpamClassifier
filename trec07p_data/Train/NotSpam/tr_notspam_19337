Orca and Gnome are both great products and I would encourage their use but, 
if your budget allows, you should probably purchase a DoubleTalk LT which is 
an external hardware synthesizer.  The desktop environment still has its 
quirks and if it unexpectedly dies you will be dumped into a shell, so best 
to have hardware speech if at all possible.  Insure that you have a serial 
port, though.
