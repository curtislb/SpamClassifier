I forgot to remove this eval. I just added this becaus on commandline a
new fresh perl -wle 'getpwnam("...") ' works fine.

well i just added that eval, because I really wanted perl to 
interprete string new, like the perl -wle ... on the
commandline.

I'll try your code on monday at work. I hope that will help. But I am
afraid it won't because as you said, without eval it shoud have worked.
