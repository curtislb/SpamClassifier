Thanks Tom and Chas...

du -sh user.rewrites.*
37M     file.pag

ls -l file.pag 
-rw-r--r--  1 root root 499661824 2007-06-08 10:40 file.pag


I can't believe it.. Sometimes the answer is in front of your nose and you don't see it. I'm trying to copy a 500M file into a 248MB Ram disk and I didn't see it because when I used 'cp' it worked.

If nobody does it before then, I'll fill in a bug report this weekend!

Thanks again, especially for the pragmatic reply from Chas Owens!!!!!

Great weekend everyone!
