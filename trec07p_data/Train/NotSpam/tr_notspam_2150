Lou Dobbs Tonight
Monday, April 16, 2007

Tonight, the worst school shooting in U.S. history. At least 30
people dead after a gunman opened fire on dorms and classrooms
on the campus of Virginia Tech University. Join Lou for a full
examination of school safety in the aftermath of today’s mass
murder.

Investors are probing whether our nation’s higher education is
rife with kickbacks and conflicts of interest. College student
loan administrators routinely sit on boards of public companies
that sell student loans. And, there’s new evidence of a
revolving door between the industry and the U.S. Department of
Education. We’ll have a full report.

There’s a major election battle going on in Carpentersville,
Illinois. And, the number one dividing issue is illegal
immigration. Six candidates are running for just three vacant
seats. Of those candidates, half support a law similar to
Hazleton, Pennsylvania’s ordinances which would make it a crime
to hire, do business with or rent housing to illegal aliens. A
sweep by either side could determine the ordinance’s fate.
We’ll have a special report.

The Bush administration is falling behind in its goal to hire
Border Patrol agents to replace National Guard troops on the
U.S. – Mexico border. A new report from the North County Times
found the government has hired only 593 of the 6,000 Border
Patrol agents it wants to place on the border by the end of
next year. That’s only 9 percent of their goal. Meanwhile,
National Guard units are planning to reduce the number of
National Guard troops on the border. We’ll have a full report,
tonight.

Did shock jock Don Imus’ punishment fit his crime? Best-selling
author, syndicated columnist and radio talk show host Larry
Elder joins us.
