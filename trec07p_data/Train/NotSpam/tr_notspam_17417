Hello there,

I'm a grad student at this school and I am writing my thesis.
I'm a big fan of open-[access,source,wiki] concepts, and contribute
from  time to time.

The thesis document process at my school is generally archived at UMI.
They have 2 options either a restrictive copyright agreement, or something
like the GFDL. I wouldn't want either. I want to use a copyright agreement
that would allow non-commercial use, with attribution and free distribution
of the document.

The problem is, I want this copy of the document to be archived in the UMI
repository, and I will be paying them to do it. Moreover, they get
subscription money
from libraries to access the archive. So that is how it works, now. I pay
them money
for them to make more money, and not helping me with a proper copyright
agreement
of my own choice (from Creative Commons ofcourse).

I had written to the UMI but Im being  jerked around from one place to
another. My
school doesnt really care; I want the UMI to host the document in
open-access, but
under a copyright agreement of my choice.

Any and all help is appreciated.
Thanks,
Muthu
