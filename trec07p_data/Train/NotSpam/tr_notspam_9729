I have no tried against longhorn yet, but honestly, the transcript I
read in this blog is not the good.
There is simply just one net ads join try after a good number of error
in configuring/using kerberos. I would like to see a test and see some
logs before saying it does not work.

In any case, I agree it is time to start testing longhorn.

Simo.
