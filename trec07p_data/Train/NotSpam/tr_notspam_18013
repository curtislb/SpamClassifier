Changes and additions:

   SR-30 (06/09/07): Crew awake; updated FD-2 timeline; rendezvous timeline=
; TPS inspection on tap
   SR-31 (06/09/07): MMT reviews initial inspection results
   SR-32 (06/10/07): Shuttle Atlantis closes in on space station
   SR-33 (06/10/07): Shuttle begins final rendezvous phase

1:14 PM, 6/10/07, Update: Shuttle begins final approach phase=20

Trailing the international space station by about 9 miles, shuttle commande=
r Rick Sturckow fired Atlantis' left-side maneuvering rocket today at 1:01 =
p.m. to begin the final phase of a two-day orbital chase that began with bl=
astoff Friday. If all goes well, Sturckow, flying Atlantis from the aft fli=
ght deck, will guide the shuttle to a docking at pressurized mating adaptor=
 No. 2 on the forward end of the Destiny laboratory module around 3:39 p.m.

But first, space station skipper Fyodor Yurchikhin and flight engineer Oleg=
 Kotov plan to photograph the shuttle's heat shield with powerful digital c=
ameras to help engineers in Houston assess the health of the tiles and blan=
kets that protect the orbiter during re-entry.

Positioned 600 feet directly below the space station, Sturckow plans to pit=
ch the shuttle's nose up through a 360-degree flip known as a rotational (o=
r rendezvous) pitch maneuver that will expose the belly of the orbiter to t=
he station's cameras.

The RPM, scheduled to begin around 2:38 p.m., has turned out to be one of t=
he most effective techniques yet developed to characterize the condition of=
 critical tiles on the underside of the shuttle that are exposed to ice and=
 foam debris during launch.

Once the pitch maneuver is complete, Sturckow will fly Atlantis up to a poi=
nt about 310 feet directly in front of the station with the shuttle's tail =
pointed toward Earth and its open payload bay facing PMA-2. From that point=
, it will take about 40 minutes or so to move in for docking.

The linkup is the first of three major items in today's flight plan. The as=
tronauts also plan to use Atlantis' robot arm to pull a 36,000-pound set of=
 solar arrays out of the shuttle's cargo bay so it can be handed off to the=
 station's arm for installation Monday.

While that work is going on, Atlantis astronaut Clay Anderson will join Yur=
chikhin and Kotov as a member of the Expedition 15 crew while Sunita Willia=
ms, who was launched to the station last December aboard shuttle Atlantis, =
will take his place on the shuttle crew.
