Vix666 writes with a link to a ZDNet article on the final chapter of a
story we've discussed before: [0]the first user convicted of piracy for
using BitTorrent to download a movie has really, finally, lost his case.
Chan Nai-ming was sentenced in November of 2005, [1]lost an appeal in
December of last year, and appears to have once again failed to convince
a judge to let him out. "The Hong Kong government welcomed the judgment,
saying it clarified the law regarding Internet piracy. 'This judgment has
confirmed that it commits a crime and violates copyright laws for the act
of using (BitTorrent) software to upload and distribute,' said customs
official Tam Yiu-keung in a written statement. He added the judgment
would have a deterrent effect, a view endorsed by industry watchdogs such
as the Hong Kong branch of the International Federation of the
Phonographic Industry."

Hewlett's famous garage [0]is now on the National Park Service's National
Register of Historic Places. It's not clear what exactly this will do for
the structure, since it's already owned by HP and it already very well
restored to its original glory. Anyway, for history fans and HP fans
alike, this is exciting news, akin to saving the original Edison or
Marconi labs. 'At my user group's museum, where David Packard actually
worked for a while when it was a military base, our collection features
an HP-300A Harmonic Wave Analyzer. That's a generation or two removed
from HP's garage years, but it's still fun to appreciate the connections
between their first products and the computer revolution.'"

We'll be returning once again to the world of StarCraft, it appears, and
not in the form of a Massively Multiplayer game. [0]Blizzard has
announced StarCraft 2 at their packed event in Seoul, South Korea. IGN is
liveblogging the event, describing gameplay footage being played as well
as full cinematics. From the description of ongoing events there are
massive changes to the way the game plays, new units, a physics system
within the game engine, and the capability to show over 100 units
onscreen at a time. "Showing gameplay footage - Looks like protoss ships
- floating over asteroid/ base structure - entering protoss ase - similar
looking buildings - vespene gas still in the game - character pane shows
up on right side - some protoss guy - shifts to terran bases floating on
rockets over same type of territory - sill collecting crystals as
resources - marines load out. Dustin is actually playing the game -
nothing in the game is final." Additional [1]coverage from Milky at 1up.

[0]recovered an estimated $500 Million in colonial coins from a 400 year
old shipwreck in the Atlantic. The exact location of the wreck is still
undisclosed. Odyssey is a for-profit, publicly traded company. 'In
seeking exclusive rights to that site, an Odyssey attorney told a federal
judge last fall that the company likely had found the remains of a
17th-century merchant vessel that sank with valuable cargo aboard, about
40 miles off the southwestern tip of England. A judge granted those
rights Wednesday. In keeping with the secretive nature of the project
dubbed ''Black Swan,'' Odyssey also is not discussing details of the
coins, such as their type, denomination or country of origin. Bruyer said
he observed a wide variety of coins that probably were never circulated.
He said the currency was in much better condition than artifacts yielded
by most shipwrecks of a similar age. The coins -- mostly silver pieces --
could fetch several hundred to several thousand dollars each, with some
possibly commanding much more, he said.'"

in the details behind the [0]massive internet outage Japanese web users
experienced earlier this week. According to the site [1]faulty Cisco
routers were to blame for the lapse, which left millions of customers
without service from late evening Tuesday until early in the morning on
Wednesday. "NTT East and NTT West, both group companies of Japanese
telecom giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT), are in the process of
finalizing their decisions on a core router upgrade, according to the
report. The routing table rewrite overflowed the routing tables and
caused the routers' forwarding process to fail, the CIBC report states."

where it turns out that the rocket ship has a self-destruct button, it

explode. ... By the same token, I often wonder whether trusted computing
architectures that allow remote parties to enforce policy on your

[0]theodp writes "How do you replace your Chief Pretexting Officer? HP
CEO Mark Hurd announced that [1]Joel Hyatt, an individual of 'exceptional
judgment and outstanding character,' has [2]joined HP's Board of
Directors, filling one of the seats vacated during [3]last year's
boardroom scandal. Hyatt, who [4]drew the ire of a judge over the
illegal, Philadelphia-like treatment of an attorney at Hyatt's namesake
law firm who was diagnosed with AIDS, was also appointed to HP's HR and
Compensation Committee. Presumably, the HP womenfolk won't hold it
against Hyatt that he reportedly once [5]advocated keeping alma mater
Dartmouth female-free. Hyatt [6]acknowledged making mistakes that he's
learned from, but said he was not eager to share them."

[0]rs232 writes to let us know that the US House of Representatives
Committee on Homeland Security called this week for the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission to further investigate the cause of [1]excessive
network traffic that shut down an Alabama nuclear plant. Investigators
want to know whether the data storm could have been initiated from
outside the plant.

[0]Jared writes "The Pirate Bay has confirmed that is working on a
[1]streaming video site with user-generated content. A spokesman said the
site will be modeled after YouTube but there will be 'no censorship': The
Pirate Bay 'will not be the moral police' and determine what content
stays or goes as is oftentimes the case with YouTube. He added that 'the
community will have to do that.'" The site will be at thevideobay.org,
but nothing is up there for the public yet.
