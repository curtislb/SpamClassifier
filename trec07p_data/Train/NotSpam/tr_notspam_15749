Hi, just wondering where to obtain not only speechd-up and dispatcher latest 
CVS snapshot (assuming both of the snapshots are all the way up-to-the very 
present moment of all development work on both programs.) And where do I 
obtain the latest and greatest LibspeechD library component that is needed 
to see if Speech-Dispatcher continues crashing?
Also, Hynek  or something else who is developing this, could someone please 
tell me if these crashes wich you have been receiveing information on are 
occuring on SMP or non SMP kernels? BC Speech-Dispathcer segfaults and 
toally shuts down (therefore closing all connections and requireing a manaul 
restart) no matter whenever I use an SMP capable kernel. It will not do so, 
if I force the kernel to ignore the second processor, but this really 
severely degrades my performance, and I can no longer bair to shut off SMP.
I am leaving it alone and always on forever. I'm going to test with it in 
VMWare still, that is my plan. Thanks a lot.
Regards, --Keith.
