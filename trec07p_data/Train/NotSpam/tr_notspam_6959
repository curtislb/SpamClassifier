Russell, you are right, but your wrong.

In particular, you think that what happened at Digg will only be of 
value if it translates into some political action, without realizing 
that what happened at Digg WAS A POLITICAL ACTION. It was the most basic 
grass roots political action on earth. People were taking direct action 
to influence policy that they felt strongly about.

It is direct democracy. And while in this case it is directed at the 
policies of an organization of which they are members, it is also 
applied to our country as well. Why do you think so many people flout 
the law and download movies and music so openly?

I think events like this one if seen by the country's politicians will 
make them stand up and take note of just how much we will allow our 
freedoms to be limited.

Do not under estimate the power of civil disobedience. We need more of 
these events. They are no less powerful then the Parliamentary petitions.

cheers,
darryl
