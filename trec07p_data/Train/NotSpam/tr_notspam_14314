Reminder: Tomorrow, KEI hosts the brown bag "The New US Trade Agenda
and Access to Medicines"

Date:  Wednesday, May 30th, 2007
Time:  12:30-2:00pm
Venue:  1621 Connecticut Avenue Suite 500, Washington, DC 20009

*this event is open to the public*

Knowledge Ecology International will host a brown bag lunch and panel
discussion on the generic drug/intellectual property provisions in
the guidelines for a new US trade policy recently released by the
Congressional Ways and Means Committee and the Bush Administration.

The new trade policy will impact US free trade agreements with Peru
and Panama and could shape both the content and the process for
approving future US FTAs.  The document includes changes to the US's
stance on data exclusivity, patent extensions, linkage, and use of
side letters.  The brown bag will feature an expert panel to include:

Fabiana Jorge, MFJ International
James Love, Knowledge Ecology International
Robert Weissman, Essential Action
Stephanie Burgos, Oxfam

Each will discuss their organization's reaction to the new trade
agenda and engage in a Q&A with attendees.

If you plan to attend, please RSVP to ben.krohmal@keionline.org or
call 202 332 2670.
