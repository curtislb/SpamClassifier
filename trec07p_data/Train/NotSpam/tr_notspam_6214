Greetings.

I've been using perl for years under Unix and yesterday I picked up a  
MacBook.

It doesn't come with DBI, so I tried to instal it from CPAN...
And installing from CPAN I always started with Bundle::CPAN to get a  
"clean slate"
I haven't had any success with it and I'm really unfamiliar with the  
details of how Mac OS X is set up as an operating system.

I'm not sure what I can do at this point, other than cry a little and  
go to bed early....

but I ended up with the following:

perl -MCPAN -e shell
install Bundle::CPAN

ends with:
File-HomeDir-0.64/LICENSE
File-HomeDir-0.64/Makefile.PL
Removing previously used /Users/tom/.cpan/build/File-HomeDir-0.64

   CPAN.pm: Going to build A/AD/ADAMK/File-HomeDir-0.64.tar.gz

Checking if your kit is complete...
Looks good
Warning: prerequisite Mac::Carbon 0.77 not found. We have 0.71.
Writing Makefile for File::HomeDir
     -- NOT OK
Running make test
   Can't test without successful make
Running make install
   make had returned bad status, install seems impossible
