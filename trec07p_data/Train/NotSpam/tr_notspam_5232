Your path to perl may have changed.  `which perl`

If you are running it straight up ./my.pl and check the first line.
Normally should be #!/usr/bin/perl.  If this is the case then talk to
your administrator about upgrading the version of perl on the machine to
a current version.  (It is a royal pain when you have different version
on different boxes)

Thanks
Ken
