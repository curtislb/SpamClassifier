This is not possible. You can not tell certain threads to run on certain 
cores without modifying the code itself. Also the problems with 
speechdup/speech dispatcher on multi-core systems relate to the fact that 
multiple threads run concurrently rather than running in a pre-emptive 
manner.
That is to say on a single core only one process runs at a time; with each 
process scheduled into running one after the other.

The code in speechdup/speech dispatcher needs to be rewritten to take into 
account the possibility of multiple threads running at once, and your only 
solution to running this stabily on your system is to disable your second 
core or run and test cvs code.
Without testers it will take far longer to debug these problems; and unless 
you are willing to run a single core you sacrifice stability regardless of 
whether the code is cvs or not.
cvs is not difficult to use; and you simply check out a source tree which 
you then build.

If you are not used to building from source; perhaps it is necessary to wait 
for the next stable release of these tools that will be stable and aware of 
smp systems.

Regards, Kerry.
