I have numerous replicated goodness-of-fit experiments (observed compared t=
o expected counts in categories) and these
replicates are nested within a factor.=20
The expected counts in each cell are external (from a
scientific model being tested).  The
calculations I need within each level of the nesting factor are a heterogen=
eity
G test, with the total G and the pooled G across replicates.  Then I would =
like to form an F ratio equal to
the ratio of pooled G divided by its degrees of freedom to heterogeneity G =
divided
by its degrees of freedom.  The F ratio
would (I think) test the hypothesis that the badness-of-fit in the pooled d=
ata
is greater than would be expected by chance from the heterogeneity among re=
plicates.=20=20

It seems that the function loglm is the closest within R to what I want.  B=
ut I can=A2t see
how it can be used when the expected
proportions are externally provided.


=20


I=A2ve appended here a function I wrote that more or less does
what I want (with the nesting factor ignored) but I would prefer to use som=
ething
like loglm because of the additional information it offers and its
flexibility with hierarchical models.
