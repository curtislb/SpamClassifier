I believe someone used the generated power from a flowing stream
to get enough electricity to run a small motor to pump water out
of the very same stream, up to a tank in their loft space.

It wasn't the fastest pump, and took "forever" to fill a large
tank, but it worked 24x7. They used the (now pressurized) water
out of the tank about a few gallons per day.
Easily replenished by the next day.
