<B>Coming up this Sunday on Reliable Sources: </B>

<B>Open Season on Giuliani</B>

He may be leading the Republican polls, but Giuliani is taking a thrashing in the press.  From his stance on abortion to his dressing as a woman for a handful of comedy shows the attacks are coming fast and furious, and often from the media on the right.  Is the former mayor of New York getting a fair shake?

<B>Romney Vs. Sharpton</B>

Al Sharpton has been in the news a lot recently since he lead the charge against radio show host Don Imus.  Is the press now giving him a pass after making insensitive comments about republican candidate Mitt Romney's religion?

<B>Video Voyeurism</B>

Has the public's obsession with watching celebrity's gotten out of control?  Paparazzi photos are one thing, but the recent spate of personal tapes and videos of celebrities at their worst personal moments have caused celebrity watching to take an ugly turn.  Are the media crossing the line?  And the worse things get for Paris Hilton, the more coverage she gets, what's that all about?

<B>Plus, </B> Journalists rub elbows with the queen, local newspapers outsourcing to India, and why the U.S. press is so much kinder to George W. Bush than the British press is to Tony Blair.

<B>Join us this Sunday and every Sunday at 10am ET / 7am PT for our critical look at the media! </B>
