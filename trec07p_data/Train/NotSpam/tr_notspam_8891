IANAL, but ISTM that it must be. Clipart collections have been published
that include such caricatures (e.g. in the last Corel Draw release that
I looked at -- that was some years ago, but I assume the law hasn't
changed that much since then).

Normally, there would still be some issues for the end user with using
"likenesses" of these people, however since these are "celebrities"
there are also a number of exemptions. It's possible to get into a
defamation lawsuit when using something that is clearly meant to depict
an individual, when it is used to make libelous representions about
someone. However, if you are in certain classes of public life, you
can't make this kind of lawsuit (e.g. you can say that George Bush eats
babies, and that's pretty much protected speech -- you're allowed to get
pretty nasty in political commentary).

Generally, you are on safer ground spoofing people with strongly
developed public personas. I don't know the actual reasoning or exactly
how the line is drawn between "public figures" and "ordinary people",
but I think the argument is basically that these are people who've
entered "public life" so they are subject to public criticism (or
praise). You'll see lots of examples of political cartoons involving
political leaders and/or entertainers. This is pretty much all
"protected speech" AFAIK.

OTOH, you'd probably be baiting a lawsuit if you used a caricature of
Paris Hilton in an advertisement to suggest that she uses your product.
But I think that's pretty obvious to most people. This type of thing is
probably stronger for "public figures" since they derive their income
from the use of their image (no one cares if *I* use your product, so
saying that I do when I don't does me less material damage -- though
it'd still be "false advertising").

So, I believe that 1) public domain is absolutely okay (as would be any
license you choose -- you own the art), 2) there are very few legal
risks for the end user with using such caricatures, but there are of
course a few. None of which would be your responsibility, AFAIK.

BTW, sounds fun! Where I can I download them?! :-D

Cheers,
Terry
