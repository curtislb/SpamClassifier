AIUI, the FSF seems to have taken the position that it does. You're free
to disagree and take some one to court but you're going to have argue
against the GFDL authors about what they meant (despite the fact that
its been clarified in public).

Apologies I'm confusing this with something else. I don't recall the
details.
