It's not necessarily fine.  It depends on which is the intended meaning
of "contact information".

If I can replace the previous contact information with something like:

|  Modified by anonymous.
|
|  No contact information is provided.

and that counts as the "contact information" of the "alterer", then it's
fine.

If I am instead compelled to disclose my indentity in order to
distribute altered copies, then it's not fine, IMO.
Being forced to disclose one's own identity can be a fee and thus fail
DFSG#1.

Compare with GNU GPL v2, section 2., subclause a, which states:

]   a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
]   stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

and thus does not insist that your identity be disclosed.
You can just say that you changed the files and declare the date of any
change: this will suffice, without necessarily disclosing your real
identity (you can use a nick, a pseudonym, or simply the "anonymous"
term).


IMO, this license does not clearly meet the DFSG.
It could, but that depends on the interpretation of this specific
clause, which seems to be ambiguous.
