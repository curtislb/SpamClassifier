Not entirely

Perl 5 is really Perl 5/Perl 5, Java is Java/Java, in the sense of C#/.NET
The distribution provides both a language and a virtual machine, although
that virtual machine is not really accessible apart from via the language of
the same name. Java toolchains are written in Java, although I admit that I
don't know how early Java is used during the building of a Java VM from
source. But I don't see a fundamental reason not to write more of the Parrot
build system toolchain in a language that runs atop the Parrot VM, rather
than the Perl 5 VM, over the long term.

(In the shorter term, the Perl 5 code works, and change for the sake of
change itself is make-work, and a distraction from progressing other areas,
such as implementing PDDs, and exterminating bugs)
