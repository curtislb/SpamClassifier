That's odd, I have done quite a few slackware installs over the years 
and never had issues with the menus.  The only issue I've ran into is 
installing on machines with only SCSI disks, who's controlers aren't 
supported by the speakup.s kernel.

Eh, that's it, I guess.  No 300 million dollar unveiling event for this
kernel, I'm afraid, but you're still supposed to think of this as the
"happening of the century" (at least until the next kernel comes along).
Oh, and this is another kernel in that great and venerable "BugFree(tm)"
series of kernels. So be not afraid of bugs, but go out in the streets
and deliver this message of joy to the masses.
