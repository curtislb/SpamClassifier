New Cluster B text (Draft Agreed Proposals) out on Norm-setting,
Flexibilities, Public Policy and Public Domain
June 14th, 2007 by Thiru Balasubramaniam

The following Cluster B text came out of the informal green room
negotiations which broke out around 7 PM Geneva time last evening. The
only word that seems to have brackets is the word “competition”.

    1. In its activities, including norm-setting, WIPO should take into
account the flexibilities in international IP agreements, especially
those which are of interest to developing countries and LDCs.

    2. To urge the IGC to accelerate the process on the protection of
genetic resources, traditional knowledge and folklore, without
prejudice to any outcome, including the possible development of an
international instrument or instruments.

    3. To initiate discussions on how, within WIPO’s mandate, to further
facilitate access to knowledge and technology for developing countries
and LDCs to foster creativity and innovation and to strengthen such
existing activities within WIPO.

    4. To promote norm-setting activities related to IP that support a
robust public domain in WIPO’s Member States, including the
possibility of preparing guidelines which could assist interested
Member States in identifying subject matters that have fallen into the
public domain within their respective jurisdictions.

    5. WIPO shall conduct informal, open and balanced consultations, as
appropriate, prior to any new norm-setting activities, through a
member-driven process, promoting the participation of experts from
Member States, particularly developing countries and LDCs.

    6. WIPO’s norm-setting activities should be supportive of the
development goals agreed within the UN system, including those
contained in the Millennium Declaration.

    The WIPO Secretariat, without prejudice to the outcome of Member
States considerations, should address in its working documents for
norm-setting activities, as appropriate and as directed by Member
States, issues such as: a) safeguarding national implementation of
intellectual property rules b) [competition] c) IP-related transfer of
technology d) potential flexibilities, exceptions and limitations for
Member States and e) the possibility of additional special provisions
for developing countries and LDCs.

    7. To consider how to better promote pro-competitive IP licensing
practices, particularly with a view to fostering creativity,
innovation and the transfer and dissemination of technology to
interested countries, in particular developing countries and LDCs.
