DOS can only access 2GB partitions, and 2GB is small for winxp,
I'd suggest at least 5GB for that. Also most versions of DOS do
not support FAT32, but here's a list of which do:

> I would suggest installing XP on a FAT32 partition, as then you can have a
> DOS floppy to access the drive, if you need to.
