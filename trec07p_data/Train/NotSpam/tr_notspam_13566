You can also try validating your regression model via the bootstrap (the
validate() function in the Design library is very helpful).  To my mind
that would be much more reassuring than normality tests performed on twenty
residuals.

By the way, be careful with the correlation test - it's only good at
detecting linear relationships between two variables (i.e. not helpful for
detecting non-linear relationships).

Thank you all for your replies.... they have been more useful... well
in my case I have chosen to do some parametric tests (more precisely
correlation and linear regressions among some variables)... so it
would be nice if I had an extra bit of support on my decisions... If I
understood well from all your replies... I shouldn't pay soooo much
attntion on the normality tests, so it wouldn't matter which one/ones
I use to report... but rather focus on issues such as the power of the
test...

Thanks again.
