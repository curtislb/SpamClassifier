I think Damian would take exception to that statement. He worked quite 
hard to make sure that POD describes _meaning_ rather than _appearance_.
He even renamed B<> from "bold" to "basis", I<> from "italic" to 
"important", and U<> from "underline" to "unusual". All of those are 
fairly odd choices, with the possible exception of "important", but they 
were clearly made with an eye to backwards compatibility of POD while 
changing people's focus from how it looks to what it is.

Well, I'd argue that head3 has plenty of semantics. It's a level-3 
header. How that's rendered is decided elsewhere.

I think the issue is not that head3 is insufficiently semantic, it's 
just that you want something that's even more specific. And POD 6 was 
designed with exactly that kind of thing in mind. You can, according to 
the existing S26, say things like:

     =Method the method synopsis goes here....
     =begin Parameters
     =item foo is the fooiest parameter
     =item bar is the barstest parameter
     =end Parameters

Furthermore, the Perl parser actually *keeps* the POD chunks, so you can 
access all that information in the context of the Perl parse. Damian and 
Larry were clearly laying the groundwork for exactly the sort of 
javadoc-ish features you are asking for.
