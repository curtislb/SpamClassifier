I can't parse this sentence.  If you meant "I do not know what is the
function", then you want the File::Find module.  See `perldoc
File::Find`.

If you meant "I do not want to read the subdirectories", then use the
filetest operators (`perldoc -f -X`) to determine whether each entry
is a file or a directory, and skip over the directories.

This does not do what you think it does.  opendir() only opens a
directory for reading via readdir().  It does not change the current
working directory of your script.  You have two options:
1) Change working directory, and then ask the shell for all files in
the current working directory
2) Open a directory, and read the files in that directory.
You, however, are opening a directory, and then asking the shell for
all the files in the current working directory.

Change these two lines to either:
opendir my $dh, $filedir or die $!
my @f = grep /^mlc/, readdir($dh);
or
chdir $filedir or die $!
my @f = <mlc*>;

(You were also calling opendir() without a directory handle argument -
I'm suprised that didn't give you a syntax error).

See also:
perldoc -f opendir
perldoc -f chdir
perldoc -f readdir
perldoc -f glob

Hope that helps,
Paul Lalli
