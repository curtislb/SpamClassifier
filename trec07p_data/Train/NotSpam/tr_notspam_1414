CC have limited SA's copyleft to derivative works. This is a  
reasonable position but doesn't always meets people's expectations or  
model the existing "social contract" for use of different kinds of work.

> This is one reason a number of photographs who upload to Wikimedia

The GFDL seems to define both texts and images as "documents" and  
replace the concept of derivation with the concepts of modification  
and combination. The reason that photographs would work as expected  
under the GFDL would be because it defines a modified version as:

"... any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either  
copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another  
language."

But this crucially assumes that an article illustrated by a photo  
constitutes a "work". From the discussion of using photography for  
illustration I'm not sure that it does. If it doesn't, it might be the  
case that you can just use the photograph under the GFDL's unmodified  
copying permission, which is how you can use a photo as an  
illustration under BY_SA.

IANAL, TINLA.

Yes. I'm very glad that Lessig is talking about this and urging a  
broader discussion though.
