Hi!

I'm wondering if you could point me to some easy step-by-step tutorial for
the following problem (i got tons of tuts on google, none of them really
helped me)

Backgroung: I've written a pseudo-filesystem in C for my game
(BlinkenSisters). As the planned level editor is going to be Perl/TK, i want
to include that functionallity.

I got some .c/.h files likr this:
bsfs.c bsfs.h bsfs_rawio.c bsfs_rawio.h ...
wgere bsfs.h is the only "external" interface file (other .h files used only
internal)

Now i want to build a all-in-one package for upload to CPAN.

What the package should do:
1) compile all .c files to a library
2) automatically generate a BSFS_Interface.pm from bsfs.h
3) so i can use it in BSFS.pm in an OO manner
4) Install everything in its place

I certainly know how to do 3) and 1), but i haven't got the slightest idea
how to get it actually into a package.

As the C-code wiggles around some data structures, i guesses that i'm gonna
have to use SWIG instead of XS. But how to integrate that ìnto a package?
Could i do 2) with XS, when the functions return data structures? How?

Thanks in advance for your help.

LLAP & LG
Rene
