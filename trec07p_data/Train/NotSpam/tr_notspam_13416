This is almost a word-for-word copy of the MIT license.  The
differences look to me like improvements and clarifications, with no
impact on DFSG conformance.

Various boost libraries are already in Debian under this license[1].
Why ask -legal to verify its DFSG freeness?

[1]- http://packages.debian.org/changelogs/pool/main/b/boost/boost_1.33.1-10/libboost-date-time1.33.1.copyright
which mentions many libraries beyond Boost's date_time library
