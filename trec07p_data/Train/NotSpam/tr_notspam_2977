 Charity Fund for Victims of Virginia Tech Shootings - Please Give? 

 Monday, April 16th, saw the horrific shootings at Virginia Tech.  Tuesday we posted the full text of the emails sent by VA Tech to warn the students of the shootings as they were going on.  Today, while the friends and families of the shooting victims - as well as all of the students and faculty at Virginia Tech who lived through the terror - struggle to make sense of it and to overcome their ordeal - we ask you to please, please take a minute to make a donation -any donation of any amount - to the fund that has been set up at Virginia Tech to help with grief counselling and expenses.
