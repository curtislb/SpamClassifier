That's a useful example.

Would it then be fair to say that this block is a Parrot developer's  
tool rather than something inherent to the Parrot installation  
process (where that process is thought of as a configure-build-test- 
install sequence)?

And if it is a developer's tool, would it be better off in a separate  
script from Configure.pl?

I raise these questions because, as I write tests for Configure.pl  
and the modules underlying it, I need to know whether the test is  
meant to be run when the filesystem is in a 'pre-Configure.pl' state  
or in the 'post-Configure.pl/pre-make' state.

Thanks for your rapid response!
