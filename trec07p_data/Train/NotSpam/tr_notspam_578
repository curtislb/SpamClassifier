QUOTE OF THE DAY

any reward."=20
- John Maynard Keynes=20

TONIGHT ON THE CBS EVENING NEWS
<http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/eveningnews/main3420.shtml>=20

Here's an early look at what we are working on from Anchor and Managing
Editor, Katie Couric...=20

Hi everyone,=20

This morning, the Rutgers women's basketball team spoke up about
controversial comments made about them by radio host Don Imus. Their
coach slammed what she called "racist and sexist remarks that are
deplorable, despicable and unconscionable." The team captain said Imus
had stolen "a moment of pure grace" from the athletes. Nancy Cordes will
have the story and Richard Schlesinger will put the Imus controversy in
perspective with a report on racism in America.=20

On Capitol Hill, momentum is building up to a likely clash over
stem-cell research. As dual bills that would provide public funding for
research using human embryos move through Congress, the White House says
that President Bush's veto pen is ready for whatever form of the
legislation hits his desk. Sharyl Attkisson will have that story.=20

And Dr. Jon LaPook will look at one of the potential uses for
stem-cells: to help cure type 1 diabetes. The Journal of the American
Medical Association reported that stem cells taken from the blood of a
small sample of diabetes patients have helped the patients' immune
systems go months, and even years, without insulin. Fourteen out of the
15 patients studied saw marked improvement in their diabetes, showing a
glimmer of hope for a cure.=20

In other health news, researchers reported last night that the
fastest-growing group of obese people in the United States are those 100
pounds or more overweight. These people are known as "severely obese."
The proportion of Americans fitting that description grew by an
astonishing 50 percent between 2000 and 2005.  Kelly Cobiella will bring
us this report.=20

For two years Army Specialist Mario Lozano has agonized about taking the
life of an Italian secret agent while manning a roadblock on Iraq's most
dangerous highway. Now, as he awaits trial in Italy for the death of
Nicola Calipari, Lozano shares details of the shooting with our chief
foreign correspondent Lara Logan.=20

I hope you'll join us. Katie=20

And here's an early look at one of the stories we are working on for
Wednesday's broadcast of the CBS Evening News:=20

Fighting in Afghanistan between NATO forces and the Taliban is
intensifying with the arrival of spring, and our Lara Logan is in the
thick of it. So that story and much more, Wednesday night, on the CBS
Evening News.=20

TONIGHT ON DAVID LETTERMAN <http://www.cbs.com/latenight/lateshow/>=20

Actor David Duchovny AND Philadelphia Phillies star Ryan Howard will
join Dave tonight. Plus, musical guest Andrew Bird!

________________________________


WEDNESDAY MORNING ON THE EARLY SHOW
<http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/earlyshow/main500202.shtml>=20

Harry Smith, Hannah Storm, Julie Chen and Russ Mitchell anchor THE EARLY
SHOW from New York. Dave Price will bring us the weather.=20

Along with the top news of the day, we will also have the following
stories:=20

ANNA NICOLE'S SISTER: NEW BOOK, PT. 2: In the second part of our
exclusive two-part interview with Donna Hogan, the sister of Anna Nicole
Smith, we'll ask Hogan what is was like for the former Playboy Playmate
and reality show star to live in the spotlight. What does Hogan make of
the paternity battle over Anna Nicole's daughter Dannielynn? We'll ask
her Wednesday morning.=20

MOUNTAIN LION ATTACK UPDATE: In January, seventy-year-old Jim Hamm and
his wife Nell went hiking in the Redwood Forest near Eureka, California.
Suddenly, Jim was attacked by a vicious mountain lion. The ambush left
Jim fighting a long road to recovery. The lion had gripped Jim's head in
its jaws, with a clench so tight that his wife of nearly fifty years
thought nothing could deter the beast. But before she even had time to
think, Nell picked up a stick to beat the lion. Eventually, the lion let
go. Miraculously, Jim lived to tell the tale: about the attack, his
wife's courage, and how he is doing today. He and his wife will join us
Wednesday morning with their harrowing tale.=20

MY GENERATION: BRIDES WITH BELLIES: It used to be that women got married
and then had a baby. But increasingly, that is not the case. Celebrities
have made it fashionable to wed while with child, but they are certainly
not the first women to do so. Today, because more and more women are
marrying when they are older, many are pregnant when they do walk down
the aisle. Some women, on the other hand, are waiting to get married
until after their baby is born. What used to be a stigma is now
something brides are flaunting with maternal pride. So what is behind
the trend? Relationship writer Amy Kean will join us with the latest on
baby-on-board nuptials, and why saying "I do" may be a reaction to the
pitter-patter of little feet.=20

PET ALLERGIES: Dogs, just like people, can suffer from allergies and
some of the symptoms: chewing on paws, scratching, licking or recurrent
ear infections. So how can you protect your pooch from the effects of
seasonal allergies? While your pet's vet may have tips, our resident
veterinarian Debbye Turner will join us with her advice on keeping man's
best friend comfortable during allergy season.=20

ACCESSORIZING WITH SPRING BAGS: With the rise of spring, fashion's
hottest accessory very well may be the handbag. But what are the best
picks for every occasion? Whether you are looking for a carry-all to
tote all of your belongings, or a slim clutch for a night out on the
town, choosing a bag that suits you does not have to be a difficult
affair. Kim France, Editor of Lucky magazine, will join us Wednesday
morning with her top picks for spring.=20

GENE SIMMONS PLAYS XBOX: Known for his over-the-top antics and
outrageous displays, Gene Simmons is as bad as he ever was. The KISS
star and family man has a hit reality show and is showing no signs of
slowing down. Wednesday morning, two of the best Guitar Hero video
gamers will join us, along with Gene Simmons, to play Guitar Hero on
XBOX! Simmons will play the bass while the gamers play the game. You
won't want to miss it!=20
