A google search on 13b1:0020 turned up
http://rt2x00.serialmonkey.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=21775&sid=9976e89f9bb1506206ec723988bec8b7

It looks like this could be an rt73 card.

Check out the rt2x00 project:
http://rt2x00.serialmonkey.com/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page

Debian has several source packages for RaLink drivers, which you can 
easily install using module-assistant:

- This is newer, being developed to cover a lot of rt2x00 chips, 
http://packages.debian.org/unstable/net/rt2x00-source

- There are also some packages which might be more directly 
  related to your device, (though this might not be under development
  anymore, since people are focused on the rt2x00 driver):
http://packages.debian.org/experimental/net/rt73-common
http://packages.debian.org/experimental/net/rt73-source

If you can't get the Debian packages to work, getting the latest CVS (or 
git) from the rt2x00 project can help.

BTW, it sounds like you might need to also get the firmware for this 
device for the drivers to work.
