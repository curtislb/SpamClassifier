TONIGHT ON THE CBS  <http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/eveningnews/main3420.s=
html> EVENING NEWS

Here is an early preview of what we are planning for tonight's CBS EVENING =
NEWS from Anchor and Managing Editor, Katie Couric...=20

Hi everyone,=20

Tonight, we'll be broadcasting from Philadelphia, home of the Independence =
Hall, the Liberty Bell and a vibrant population that is the sixth-largest i=
n the United States. Philly is also known as the city where American democr=
acy was born - and tonight we'll have a cultural and historical view of a c=
ity that has contributed so much to our country's history.=20

This city, which was home to the country's first hospital - founded by Benj=
amin Franklin in 1751 - now is having a health-care crunch that's particula=
rly acute for pregnant women and the care they're getting when it counts. I=
'll take a closer look at this story for you.=20

Before that, the news of the day. To start out our broadcast, David Martin =
will have an exclusive report on Pentagon planning and the war in Iraq. Mea=
nwhile, are Democrats blinking first on the prospect of a withdrawal deadli=
ne? Sharyl Attkisson will fill you in.=20

A different kind of debate is heating up on the streets - and on the Web. A=
n anti-informant "stop snitching" campaign now has a high-tech edge. And th=
is is infuriating federal prosecutors, Bob Orr will explain.=20

As hurricane season approaches, National Weather Service forecasters warn t=
hat they expect between 13 and 17 tropical storms this year, with at least =
seven of them becoming hurricanes. Is the Gulf Coast ready? Hari Sreenivasa=
n will examine New Orleans' levee system and whether it is equipped to surv=
ive a major storm.=20

We've been following the story of the two whales stranded 60 miles up the S=
acramento River in California. Sandra Hughes will tell you about the obstac=
les still in their way en route to their ocean home - and the hope spectato=
rs have for their safe return.=20

Finally, we'll come back to Philadelphia, where we will settle down with a =
cheese steak and channel some memories from decades past in the City of Bro=
therly Love.=20

I hope you'll join us.=20

oadcast:=20

Along with the top news of the day, we will also have the following stories=
:=20

CELLULITE SOLUTIONS: Why do women get cellulite and men don't? Well, you ca=
n blame estrogen. But there is hope! If you have cellulite, you know all ab=

t go away. EARLY SHOW Consumer Correspondent Susan Koeppen will join us wit=
h the news every woman wants to hear -- "How to get rid of that cellulite."=
=20

HAPPILY EVER AFTER, PART 3: Our special series, Happily Ever After, continu=
es Wednesday morning with an incredible story of love and parenting. The Lu=
chsingers met in college, married after graduation and are now dealing with=
 the challenge of three children, one of whom is autistic. For Kadi and Tod=
d, like all parents, they have to balance taking care of their kids with al=
l of life's other demands. Nearly 85% of parents with special needs childre=
n end up divorcing... but Kadi and Todd are battling the odds and making it=
 work.=20

MONEY MATTERS: STUDENT LOANS: Getting a loan to help pay for college is not=
hing new. But there are certain things you should look out for before you, =
or your child, signs on that dotted line. How can you choose an offer that =
will leave you worry free? Our financial advisor Ray Martin will join us wi=
th tips on what to look for in a student loan.=20

BEST YOU CAN BE: SUMMER BATHING SUITS: Summer is just a few weeks away and =
for many of us, that means time spent poolside and at the beach! But dreade=
d bathing suit season comes with its pitfalls. How can you find a suit that=
 both fits and flatters? Style expert Rachael Zalis will help you find the =
best suit for your body as swimsuit season gets underway.=20

SUSAN CRANDELL: THINKING ABOUT TOMORROW: You have probably heard the term m=
idlife crisis. It typically refers to the time when a person in their forti=
es and fifties realize that they are no longer young and start to feel that=
 perhaps they haven't really lived. In her new book, Thinking About Tomorro=
w: Reinventing Your Midlife, author Susan Crandell tells us how you can ful=
fill dreams that you may have been holding on to or how you can create new =
ones in your middle years. Wednesday morning, Crandell will join us with he=
r advice.=20
