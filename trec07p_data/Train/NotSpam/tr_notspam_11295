The new version of S+ (version 8.0) is supposed to be able to read R
code unmodified.  Insightful is supposedly spending a ton of time making
S+ able to use all R code without modification.  It must be taking them
longer than expected because I though it was supposed to be released by
the second quarter.  I have a S+ license and I haven't heard any
announcement from Insightful.  Anyone have more of an update?

Subject: [R] Is it possible to control R with S+?


I am currently using S+, which is my company standard econometric
package, but unfortunately in some areas R has a lot more to offer in
nice functions/libraries. Libraries I would like to use in S+. So I
would like to use the R functions by calling on R from S+. For example
export the data to be used in the R calculation in a temporary txt-file,
and then S+ calls on R to start and read the txt file. R then executes
the function specified and then exports the results in another txt file
which then S+ uploads. Is this possible? Or does anyone have another
solution?

Thanks Tom
