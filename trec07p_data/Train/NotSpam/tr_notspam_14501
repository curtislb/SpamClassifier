If you are going to rename Object, I put my vote in for Universal.

For one thing, that is the/a term used in set theory to refer to set 
of everything (under consideration).  And "universe" in general means 
the one that contains all.  We also have the advantage of continuity 
with Perl 5, which calls its maximal data type UNIVERSAL.

Object is inferior to this as, at least among computer people, Object 
smacks as describing the implementation of a type rather than of its 
meaning, and generally speaking types should be named after what they 
mean.  (Mind you, Hash very much smacks of describing implementation 
too, but there is less of a case to change that since Perl 5 people 
may revolt.)

Universal also gets the huffmanizing stuff about right ... not too 
short and not too long.

Actually, I hereby actively propose that Object be renamed to 
Universal, assuming that Object is actually the maximal data type.

Now that I've heard the explanation of what Any means, I also have no 
objection to continuing to use that, such that Any is the complement 
of Junction under Universal/Object.
