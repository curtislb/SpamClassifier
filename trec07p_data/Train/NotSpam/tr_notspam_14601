The kernel you installed from grml probably already supports software 
speech. After all, grml supports software speech. That means the next step 
is probably to install the rest of the software speech components. There are 
excellent instructions on getting software speech working on the  speechd-up 
web site.  See the following page:

http://www.freebsoft.org/doc/speechd-up/speechd-up_1.html

I like that page because it explains how to make sure that each step is 
working before moving on the the next. A lot of authors could learn from 
that.  I believe the guy who wrote that page is on this list. Herman?
