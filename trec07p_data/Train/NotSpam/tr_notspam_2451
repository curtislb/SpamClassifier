TONIGHT ON SHOWBIZ TONIGHT- CNN HEADLINE PRIME 11pm ET/ 11pm PT

VIRGINIA TECH MASSACRE - REACTION FROM THE STARS
Hollywood's biggest stars tell Showbiz Tonight their reaction to the horrifying news of the Virginia Tech shootings. Jessica Biel, Julianne Moore, and Nicolas Cage give their passionate views, on TV's most provocative entertainment news show.

HOLLYWOOD AND VIOLENCE
In the wake of the Virginia Tech massacre, Showbiz Tonight asks: does the violence we see on TV and in the movies desensitize us to real-life violence? Is it time to take a closer look at how much violence we're exposed to? The provocative debate, on Showbiz Tonight.

THE DON IMUS CONTROVERSY: THE ROLE OF HIP HOP
After Don Imus' firing because of racist and sexist comments, we're asking: is hip hop next? Is it different when rappers use the kinds of words that got Imus fired? Hip hop mogul Russell Simmons answers the tough questions, in the interview you'll see only on Showbiz Tonight.

SHOWBIZ TONIGHT QUESTION OF THE DAY:
Violence and Hollywood: Is it time to tone it down?
