Dear Security Network,

    I find your postings to be extremely helpful in identifying potential
security lapses in our museum, and for alerting staff to what sorts of items
have gone missing in the world.  However, I would suggest that often one of
the biggest mysteries in the postings arises from trying to identify exactly
where the untoward behavior discussed in the postings actually took place.
It would be very helpful (even though it will reduce the amount of game time
spent solving the mysteries of where listed actions took place) if people
posting alerts took the time to identify the location discussed.  Simply
listing the place as "West Robberyville" doesn't provide the same level of
understanding as would "West Robberyville, New York, USA".  This problem
seems to be at its worst when postings are simple transfers of newspaper
articles which sometimes have as an identifier only the name of the
newspaper from which the posting was derived.

Cheers,

Thomas Loftfield

Dutch master stolen
Richard Jinman and Clare Morgan
June 14, 2007


The oil on oak panel painting ... A Cavalier (Self-Portrait).
http://www.smh.com.au/news/arts/dutch-master-stolen/2007/06/13/1181414383922
.html#

A VALUABLE self-portrait by the Dutch master Frans van Mieris has been
stolen from the Art Gallery of NSW.

It is unclear when the small painting, 20 centimetres by 16 centimetres, was
plucked from the gallery's walls or how it was taken from the building
without alerting security officers.

The gallery's director, Edmund Capon, declined last night to put a value on
it, but described it as "a valuable picture, a known picture", and said it
would be "completely unmarketable".

Mr Capon, who was preparing to fly home from London, said he was "extremely
shocked" by the theft. He believes it is the first time an artwork has been
stolen from the gallery in about 15 years.

"It's not something that we're accustomed to," he said. "It's not an easy
thing to remove the security screws and take it out of the building.

"It makes you very aware of two things: the extraordinary extent we depend
on the goodwill of our patrons and how diligent you have to be."

It is understood that The Rocks police were notified on Monday. Police
sources said they suspected it was an inside job. Police have spent three
days interviewing gallery staff and examining security footage.

The stolen painting, an oil on oak panel, was painted between 1657 and 1659.
It was donated by the art patron and philanthropist James Fairfax in 1993.

The space the painting occupied has already been filled by another work from
the collection, a gallery source said.

The robbery comes at an embarrassing time for the gallery, which recently
revealed details of the biggest security operation in its history for an
Islamic arts exhibition opening in eight days. The exhibition is believed to
be tighter than at previous shows featuring key works by Renoir, Picasso,
Pissarro and Van Gogh, according to gallery sources.

While Aboriginal art is a popular target for thieves, the theft of European
works from public art institutions in Australia is rare. The nation's most
famous art theft was more protest than profit-driven.

In 1986, a group calling itself the Australian Cultural Terrorists unscrewed
Pablo Picasso's Weeping Woman from the wall of the National Gallery of
Victoria.

The thieves brazenly put an official-looking, typewritten card in the
painting's place which, in an embarrassing security lapse, nobody noticed
for almost two days. The gallery's embarrassment was compounded by the fact
Weeping Woman was its most expensive painting, with a value of $1.6 million.

Apparently fed up with the poor treatment of arts by the state government of
the day, the group's ransom was a demand that an art prize for young artists
be established.

Police recovered the work, which shows Picasso's lover Dora Maar mourning
the bombing of Guernica during the Spanish Civil War, in a locker at the
Spencer Street station a few days later. The thieves were never caught.

Picasso also proved a magnet for thieves in the most recent high-profile art
theft. In February, burglars slipped into the Paris apartment of the
artist's granddaughter and stole two paintings - one of his daughter Maya
and another of his second wife Jacqueline - with a combined value of $85
million.

Perhaps the most high-profile theft was in August 2004 when gun-toting
thieves staged a daring daylight raid at Oslo's Munch Museum, ripping Edvard
Munch's The Scream and another of his works, Madonna. Three men were found
guilty last year of charges relating to the theft, and the paintings were
recovered.

Porcelain trail leads police to sunken ship  
 
 
 
www.chinaview.cn  2007-06-13 15:20:50  

    BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- China has found an ancient sunken ship in
the South China Sea off the Guangdong coast, according to the Guangdong
Archaeology Institute (GAI) here Wednesday. 

    According to GAI, the ship -- which was carrying a considerable amount
of Ming Dynasty porcelain -- was probably built during the Ming Dynasty. 

    Guangdong archaeologists used GPS to locate the sunken ship early June.
The vessel, dubbed South China Sea-II, is about 17 to 18 meters long and
lying at a depth of 20 meters. 

    GAI archaeologist Dr Wei Jun said "a preliminary study of the sunken
ship shows it may have sunk 400 years ago after striking a reef." 

    "The vessel was preserved well," Cui Yong, an archaeologist engaged in
the salvage work, said, revealing the deck of the ship is about 10
centimeters in thickness. 

    "Undersea exploration found a large part of the vessel was buried in
sands and porcelains piled in the vessel could be seen through part of the
cabin exposed in the seawater," Cui added. 

    The ship's existence came to light when local police got wind of illegal
salvage operations being carried out in the sea off Nanao County in South
China's Guangdong Province, Nangfang Daily reported. 

    On May 25, Nanao County police learned that some fishermen had been
recovering ancient porcelain objects from the sea. 

    The police confiscated 21 pieces of ancient porcelains from a fishing
boat whose owner claimed that divers he had hired for deep sea fishing had
recovered the porcelain by accident. 

    On May 26, another 117 pieces of porcelain were confiscated from two
fishing boats who were carrying out illegal salvage work. 

    Police stepped up monitoring of the area and warned local people not to
loot the cultural relics. On June 1, two local residents handed over 124
porcelain items to police. 

    The sunken ship was found just a few days after China started salvage
operations on the South China Sea-I, which dates back to the Song Dynasty,
the paper reported. 

    South China Sea I, discovered in 1987, was the first ancient vessel
discovered on the "Marine Silk Road" in the South China Sea. "The discovery
of South China Sea II will provide more evidence about the 'Marine Silk
Road', and help with the study of Chinese sea-faring, ship-building and
ceramics making," Wei said.

Ancient Greek artifacts recovered



By ARIEL DAVID
The Associated Press
ROME -- Italian police have recovered artifacts from an ancient Greek temple
dug up in southern Italy by a construction crew who had dumped or looted the
prized pieces and begun to pour concrete over the ruins, authorities said
Tuesday.
After receiving information about the discovery during construction work on
a tourist resort on the coast of southern Calabria, police used helicopters
to locate the site, near the town of Crotone, last week, said art squad
officials from the Carabinieri paramilitary police.

More than 50 artifacts, including columns and mosaics, had been excavated
from the site and used to decorate a hotel complex nearby, while other
pieces had been placed in a dump to be reused as construction material.

When police located the site, workers were preparing to lay the foundations
of the resort hotel on the remaining ruins, said Gen. Giovanni Nistri, the
head of the art squad.

"It would have been the final tombstone for this temple," Nistri said at a
news conference in Rome.

Police identified two suspects for possible prosecution on charges of
failing to alert authorities about the find, damaging the site and illegal
possession of archaeological artifacts, Nistri said. The two were not
arrested.

Italy is full of archaeological treasures -- many undiscovered -- and
developers must report finds. Countless public and private projects have
been scrapped or delayed over the years as state archaeologists descended on
building sites, and it is not uncommon for developers to fail to report a
discovery and plow through ancient treasures.

The discovery of the Greek temple is of "extraordinary historic and artistic
value," and experts believe that it may be part of a larger ancient
settlement, the Carabinieri said in a statement.

The ruins are "one big puzzle" for scholars, as the area was previously
thought to be devoid of such important public buildings, said archaeological
superintendent Giovanni Guzzo.

The temple mixes two styles of Greek architecture -- the austere Doric and
the more graceful decorations of Ionic. It was probably built between the
fourth and third centuries B.C. by the Bruzii, who lived under Hellenistic
influence, which at the time extended across southern Italy, Guzzo said.

Stern estate wins court order in looted art case 


By JANICE ARNOLD 
Staff Reporter 

MONTREAL - The estate of the late Montreal art dealer Max Stern has won a
round in its legal case against an elderly Rhode Island woman in possession
of a painting that the estate's lawyers say Stern was forced to sell under
duress from the Nazis 70 years ago. 

In Providence, R.I., U.S. District Judge Mary Lisi granted a request earlier
this month by the estate that ordered German-born Maria-Luise Bissonnette to
stop moving the painting, the 19th-century Girl From the Sabiner Mountains
by Franz Xaver Winterhalter. 

It came to light last September that Bissonnette had sent the artwork to
Germany in April 2006, shortly before the Stern estate launched a suit in a
Rhode Island federal court for the painting's restitution. 

The two sides negotiated for months to try to reach a settlement before the
estate took the case to court. 

Lisi also ordered Bissonnette to permit representatives of the estate to see
the painting at its current location to determine its condition and to
ensure that it is being stored properly. Bissonnette can only move the
painting again with the court's permission. 

The two sides had tried unsuccessfully to work out a deal that would have
allowed the estate to inspect the painting without seeking a court order.
Bissonnette had originally agreed only to allow the estate representatives
to view the painting at her German lawyers' offices. 

Stern, a Dusseldorf gallery owner, was ordered by the Gestapo to sell the
Winterhalter, along with about 200 other artworks, at an auction conducted
by Lempertz in Cologne in 1937. The estate claims he received only a small
fraction of their value, which was largely taxed away. 

He fled to England after this final liquidation of his inventory. 

Stern, who owned the Dominion Gallery in Montreal for more than 40 years,
died in 1987 and left his estate to Concordia and McGill universities and
the Hebrew Univesity of Jerusalem, which have created a foundation in his
name. 

More than two years ago, Concordia launched a worldwide search, headed by
Clarence Epstein, to find the confiscated Stern collection, which includes
possibly another 200 works that the dealer was forced to sell after 1935. 

The Stern estate's legal team, headed by Washington, D.C.-based Thomas
Kline, claim that the Winterhalter rightfully belongs to the estate, because
it was effectively stolen under the Nazi government's laws excluding Jews
from trade in art. 

The estate told the Rhode Island court that a German court recognized in
1964 that the Lempertz auction was coerced. Girl From the Sabiner Mountains
is also listed as confiscated by the Art Loss Register in London. 

Bissonnette, 83, who has lived in Providence for many years, says she
inherited the work from her stepfather, physician Karl Wilharm. She says he
paid for it and she has the receipt to prove it. 

The estate's own research found that Lempertz recorded that it sold the
Winterhalter to Wilharm for the equivalent of $3,600, but Stern probably
receive only two to five per cent of that, Epstein said. 

The estate alleges that Wilharm was a "high-ranking member" of the storm
troopers and a Nazi party member. 

The painting's whereabouts came to Epstein's attention when it was put up
for sale on the eBay website in January 2005 by a Rhode Island auction
house, to which Bissonnette had consigned it. 

Although she holds the hereditary title of baroness, the widowed Bissonnette
said she tried to sell the painting to pay for cancer treatment. 

The estate's lawyers charge that she spirited the painting out of the United
States to an unknown location in Germany to pre-empt litigation here. They
surmise that she hoped to get a German court to act, and possibly receive a
more sympathetic hearing. 

The estates say there had been an understanding that the painting would be
left at the Rhode Island auction house until the dispute was resolved. 

Among the evidence filed in court was a postal receipt showing that
Bissonnette put the painting's value at $50 (US), which the estate's lawyers
say may have violated U.S. customs laws. 

The Rhode Island auctioneer has said it was worth between $50,000 and
$75,000 (US). Bissonnette had earlier said through her lawyer that she would
only sell the painting to the Stern estate for $150,000. 

Bissonnette told the Boston Globe that she didn't know the painting's value
and underestimated it to discourage theft during shipment. 

Montreal lawyer Robert Vineberg, executor of the estate, said the foundation
had offered Bissonnette "a relatively small sum" as a goodwill gesture,
considering her modest means and health, although legally, he maintains, she
is owed nothing. 

In the Globe interview published before the court upheld the estate's
request, Bissonnette insisted she and her parents had done nothing wrong. 

She said her stepfather was a country doctor during World War II and did not
support the Nazi regime. She said the Nazi police demanded use of a former
bookbinding factory he owned outside Munich. 

After the U.S. District Court decision, Bissonnette's lawyer, John Weltman
of Boston, reportedly withdrew from the case over differences with his
client. He claimed he had never counselled her to send the painting to
Germany and only knew about its movement after the fact.

Senate committee wants museum to change display casting Canadian vets as
'war criminals'
  
James Zombie 
CanWest News Service 


Wednesday, June 13, 2007


OTTAWA -A special Senate subcommittee is asking the Canadian War Museum to
change part of a controversial display some veterans have claimed makes them
look like "war criminals."

At issue is a Second World War exhibit that contains a single panel
describing an "Enduring Controversy" and raises moral issues over the role
of Canadian bombing squadrons that attacked German cities in an attempt to
wipe out the Nazi war machine.

Liberal Senator Joseph Day, chair of the subcommittee on veterans affairs,
suggested the museum has a responsibility to recognize it has offended some
people, and should change the display. There were no suggestions as to how
the museum should go about doing that, even as the politicians raised no
qualms about the accuracy of the facts and information presented.

"Don't try to change history. We're not into rewriting history," Day said.
Tell the story and tell the facts, but tell it in a way that you're not
offending, unintentionally, a large segment of the Canadian public."

The facility's president, Victor Rabinovitch, wasn't available Tuesday and
wasn't expected to offer any comment until there was time to further review
the senators' recommendation.

The display panel, accompanied by photos, including one of dead civilians on
the street following an allied bombing, notes the mass raids against Germany
resulted in vast destruction and heavy loss of life.

"The value and morality of the strategic bomber offensive against Germany
remains bitterly contested. Bomber Command's aim was to crush civilian
morale and force Germany to surrender by destroying its cities and
industrial installations," it says. "Although Bomber Command and American
attacks left 600,000 Germans dead, and more than five million homeless, the
raids resulted in only small reductions of German war production until late
in the war."

Day said the subcommittee was troubled by the fact much of the exhibit was
dedicated to the heroic activities of individual airmen and crews, "and then
you get in an academic debate on the last panel, which calls into question
all of these exploits of the individuals that were highlighted in the rest
of the display."

Asked whether he believed a museum was a place for academic debate, Day
agreed it was.

"I think that's all part of the museum's responsibility," he said. "It was
just that the juxtaposition of various facts and pictures seemed to confuse
the two. I don't think it was intended, but that seems to be the case."

Complaints from veterans about the tone of the panel first surfaced in 2005,
soon after the museum opened. Following threats of boycott from a coalition
of veterans' groups, the facility undertook what it called the "exceptional
step" of seeking input from external, expert historians.

Four of them filed reports the museum said agreed with the contention that
the display, in its entirety, presented an accurate view of the air war in
Europe. Two raised concerns about the "tone" and "balance" of the one panel.
The museum said in March that it would not change the panel, adding its
decision was final.

Veterans' groups renewed their call for a boycott and asked the Senate to
intervene, resulting in Tuesday's report.
