Dear Joana,

*Don't forget to:*

*Call 1-800-828-0498 Today*

Ask your Senators to vote *YES* on the
*Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act*.

This week, the Senate will vote to decide if our government should have
the option to "negotiate lower drug prices for seniors"

Drug companies are paying millions to lobbyists on K Street in
Washington, D.C. to defeat this bill.

After you have called, please click this link
<http://ga3.org/familiesusa/join-forward.html?domain=familiesusa&r=VpMgaSS1GF5P&>

to pass the message on to your friends and family so they can call.

*What should you say?*

* Vote YES on the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation bill.

* Many seniors in our state cannot afford the high price of
prescription drugs.

* 86% of Americans agree: Medicare should use the bargaining power
of millions of seniors to negotiate lower drug prices.

*Why now?*

Currently, the government is prohibited from using the bargaining power
of 43 million Americans in Medicare to negotiate with pharmaceutical
companies for lower drug prices. Earlier this year, the House of
Representatives passed a bill to give the government the option to do
just that. Now, it’s the Senate’s turn to just say *NO* to the drug
companies.

*Call 1-800-828-0498 Today*

Ask your Senators to vote *YES* on the
*Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act*.

*THANK YOU!*
