Changes and additions:

   SR-21 (06/06/07): MMT clears Atlantis for launch; engineers brace for ev=
ening storms, possible hail
   SR-22 (06/06/07): Shuttle dodges severe storms
   SR-23 (06/07/07): Weather improves to 80 percent 'go'

11:05 AM, 6/7/07, Update: Weather improves to 80 percent 'go'=20

Making up lost time after a stormy night at the launch pad, shuttle workers=
 at the Kennedy Space Center expect to have Atlantis ready for blastoff Fri=
day night on a long-delayed space station assembly mission. There are no te=
chnical problems at pad 39A and forecasters now predict an 80 percent chanc=
e of good weather at launch time.

"After many months of hard work, Atlantis is finally ready to fly," NASA Te=
st Director Steve Payne told reporters today.

If all goes well, a protective gantry will be rolled away from Atlantis at =
10:30 p.m. and engineers will begin pumping a half-million gallons of rocke=
t fuel into the shuttle's external tank starting shortly after 9 a.m. Frida=
y.

Commander Rick Sturckow and his crewmates - pilot Lee Archambault, flight e=
ngineer Steve Swanson, Patrick Forrester, Danny Olivas, Jim Reilly and Clay=
 Anderson - plan to begin strapping in around 4:15 p.m. Liftoff is targeted=
 for 7:38 p.m., roughly the moment Earth's rotation carries the launch pad =
into the plane of the space station's orbit.

Thunderstorms Wednesday evening delayed work to load the shuttle's internal=
 tanks with liquid hydrogen and oxygen to power the ship's electricity prod=
ucing fuel cells. But Payne said the launch team was able to make up lost t=
ime using built-in holds in the countdown and no major problems were expect=
ed.

"We did have some significant weather in the area last night," said shuttle=
 weather officer Kathy Winters. "It did delay the ops a little bit, but gen=
erally, all the weather came together over the western portion of Melbourne=
 and back toward the west. There was three-quarter-inch hail down in West M=
elbourne, but no hail here at Kennedy Space Center."

Atlantis originally was scheduled for launch March 15, but the flight was d=
elayed three months after a freak hail storm caused extensive damage to the=
 top of the shuttle's external fuel tank. That damage has now been repaired=
 and engineers say they are confident the tank's foam insulation will stand=
 up to the thermal and aerodynamic rigors of launch without shedding any po=
tentially dangerous debris.

Today, Winters improved the launch forecast for Friday from 70 percent "go"=
 to an 80 percent chance of favorable weather.

"We think it looks a little bit better," she said. "Yesterday, we thought s=
ome inland thunderstorms might still be close enough to affect us, but toda=
y we're more confident they'll be more inland. So just a 20 percent chance =
of KSC weather prohibiting launch."

Emergency runways in California, New Mexico, Spain and France also are expe=
cted to be available for use if needed. Should launch be delayed, the proba=
bility drops to 70 percent go on Saturday and 60 percent on Sunday.

As of this writing, flight controllers are using 7:38:02 p.m. as the estima=
ted launch time. That may change by a few seconds based on final checks of =
the station's orbit and a final hold at the T-minus nine-minute mark will b=
e adjusted as required. That said, here are countdown highlights (in EDT; f=
ueling could begin up to a half hour earlier than the listed time):
