So in practice, authors add additional permissions and conditions as a
GPL commentary.  The actual license is a GPL derivative in a
functional sense, but probably not in the copyright sense.

I think it should be made more clear that "derivative license texts"
means actually that, and does not include derivatives that are created
by patching of some other license.

(Nothing in this message should be interpreted as support for any GR
