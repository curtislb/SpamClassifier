12:02 AM, 6/9/07, Update: Robot arm checked out; protruding blanket seen on=
 OMS pod=20

The Atlantis astronauts activated and checked out the shuttle's robot arm l=
ate Friday and used one of its TV cameras to zoom in on an insulation blank=
et that appeared to have partially pulled away from the ship's left-side af=
t rocket pod.

In the video, one corner of the white blanket appeared to have pulled away =
from an adjacent row of white tiles on the upper surface of the port orbita=
l maneuvering system rocket pod. It wasn't immediately obvious what might h=
ave caused the blanket to separate. It did not look serious, but flight con=
trollers asked the crew to pan across the blanet with the robot arm's camer=
a to help them build a three-dimensional image of the area for more detaile=
d analysis.

The astronauts then pressed ahead with a normal payload bay survey before p=
owering the arm down for the night.
