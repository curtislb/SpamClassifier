3:46 PM, 6/15/07, Update: Spacewalk underway; blanket repair work goes smoo=
thly=20

Astronaut Danny Olivas, anchored to the end of the shuttle Atlantis' robot =
arm, carried out orbital surgery on the ship's heat shield today, using a m=
edical stapler and stainless steel pins in a bid to secure a peeled-back in=
sulation blanket on one of the orbiter's aft rocket pods.

Fellow spacewalker Jim Reilly, meanwhile, worked at the Destiny laboratory =
module to replace a water valve with a hydrogen vent valve that will be nee=
ded later when a U.S. oxygen generation system begins operation.

Two hours into the spacewalk, flight controllers told Reilly they had decid=
ed to have him disconnect an electrical cable he hooked up Monday during a =
spacewalk to activate a new solar array on the right side of the station's =
main power truss. The astronauts also were warned that Russian flight contr=
ollers planned to make yet another attempt to restart the stalled computers=
. Earlier in the day, NASA officials said no more restart attempts would be=
 made today, but the Russians apparently decided otherwise.

Russian navigation system and command and control computers, which are tied=
 into the solar array electrical circuits, began malfunctioning shortly aft=
er the cable in question was connected. The cable is not currently in use a=
nd is intended to route power from a yet-to-be-launched set of arrays, know=
n as S6, through the newly installed S3/S4 truss segments and on to electri=
cal distribution boxes in the center of the power truss.

Even though the cable is not carrying any sort of electrical load, engineer=
s decided to have Reilly disconnect it just to make sure it wasn't part of =
any so-called "sneak circuits" or causing any grounding issues that might h=
ave played a role in the computer trouble.

"We have something for J.R. related to the troubleshooting that's ongoing f=
or the SM computers," astronaut Megan McArthur radioed from Houston. "We'd =
like to have him disconnect the P-12 connector that was connected during EV=
A-1. This will not be an impact until S6, so we're going to think about whe=
n to reconnect it. But for now, we'd like him to disconnect it. ... You guy=
s can work it in as you see fit."

"OK, Megan, that sounds good," Pat Forrester replied from Atlantis.

Earlier today, U.S. and Russian engineers disconnected U.S. electrical powe=
r from the Russian computer system on the theory that some sort of noise or=
 change in the circuit after the new arrays were attached might have trigge=
red the computer problems. But isolating the computers from U.S. power did =
not resolve the problem.

Russian engineers are expected to send additional commands to the computers=
 overnight that may indicate whether the P-12 cable could have played any r=
ole in the earlier computer glitches.

Today's spacewalk began at 1:24 p.m. when the astronauts switched their spa=
cesuits to internal battery power. This is the 86th EVA devoted to station =
assembly and maintenance since construction began in 1998, the ninth so far=
 this year, the third overall for the Atlantis crew and the second this mis=
sion for Reilly and Olivas.=20

Olivas began the blanket repair work by using his helmet camera to beam dow=
n close-up views of the torn insulation and surrounding blankets to help fl=
ight controllers assess the health of the system. The damage site showed up=
 in sharp detail, with a 4-inch by 6-inch corner peeled back from an adjace=
nt row of heat-shield tiles.

The damage was spotted during a routine payload bay survey shortly after la=
unch last Friday. NASA's Mission Management Team decided earlier this week =
to extend the shuttle mission by two days and to add a fourth spacewalk, in=
 part to accommodate a repair job. The team ultimately decided to add the b=
lanket work to the third spacewalk today.

Olivas had no problems gently tapping the peeled-back blanket down flat. An=
d he had no problems using the stapler and later, inserting steel pins thro=
ugh the blanket and into nearby heat-shield tiles.

Temperatures climb to between 700 and 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit on the upper=
 surfaces of the rocket pods during re-entry and while the torn blanket did=
 not appear to pose a threat to the crew, heat damage was possible to the g=
raphite epoxy structure of the rocket pod. NASA managers decided to play it=
 safe and order a repair.

After the blanket and valve replacement work is complete, Reilly and Olivas=
 will turn their attention to assisting the retraction of the P6 solar arra=
y extending to the right side of the station.

The P6 array was attached to the station in 2000 to provide power during th=
e early stages of assembly. Now, NASA needs to move it to the left end of t=
he station's main power truss to prepare the complex for the delivery of Eu=
ropean and Japanese research modules later this year and early next.

During retraction of the P6-4B array last December, the astronauts ran into=
 major problems and ultimately had to stage an unplanned spacewalk to fold =
the blankets back in their storage boxes. This time around, the Atlantis as=
tronauts have taken a more deliberate, step-by-step approach, retracting th=
e array about 28 feet before a spacewalk Wednesday in which Pat Forrester a=
nd Steve Swanson manually cleared hangups and ultimately got the 115-foot-l=
ong array in about half way.

Today, Reilly and Olivas plan to finish the job, although time is available=
 in a fourth spacewalk Sunday if they run into any major problems.
