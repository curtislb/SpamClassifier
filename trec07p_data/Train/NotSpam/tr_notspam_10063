SatCon Technology Reports Financial Results for the First Quarter Ended
March 31, 2007

Quarter end Backlog at Record $39 Million, up 56% from 2006 Solar
Inverters Grow 220% to $3.2M in the First Quarter 


BOSTON, May 14, 2007 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- SatCon Technology Corporation(C)
(NASDAQ CM: SATC), a developer and supplier of power management and
system architecture solutions for the alternative energy and distributed
power markets, today announced its operating results for the quarter
ended March 31, 2007. Revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 were
$8.3 million compared with $7.6 million in the first quarter of 2006, an
increase of 9%. More importantly, revenues in stationary power systems
increased by 57% to $3.6 million for the quarter compared to $2.3
million in the first quarter of 2006. Driving that growth were increases
in solar inverter revenues of over 220% to $3.2 million compared to $1.0
million in 2006. In addition, technology development revenue recorded
growth of over 98% to $1.8 million from $0.9 million. This revenue
growth in solar inverters and power technology development reflects the
results of the company's effort to focus on products targeted at the
alternative energy and distributed power markets. 

This trend can be seen in the quarter-end order backlog as well. Defined
as firm purchase orders from customers for future delivery, the order
backlog has not only increased over 56% to over $39 million at the end
of the first quarter, up from $25 million at the end of the first
quarter in 2006, but it has increased across all product lines.
Stationary power systems increased over 100% to $17.8 million,
technology and product development orders increased over 67% to $8.5
million, and the electronics business experienced a 12% increase to over
$7 million. As of the end of April 2007, the sales order backlog topped
$44 million, its highest level in the company's history, with continued
strong growth in all areas but driven primarily by the solar inverter
product line. Sales order bookings for April alone were over $8 million,
including over $4 million for Photovoltaic Inverters. 

"This is definitely a positive trend," said David Eisenhaure, President
and Chief Executive Officer. "With our current sales order backlog at
over $44 million at the end of April, we believe that we have the
ability to achieve revenues on the order of $50 million for the year
2007, up from our actual revenue in 2006 of approximately $34 million.
The majority of the increase in our revenue is expected to come from our
photovoltaic inverter product line. As we achieve this increased revenue
for 2007, we expect our losses from operations to decline accordingly.
We will need additional working capital to fund that growth, and we
expect to request a release of a negative covenant with our note holders
to allow us to secure this additional working capital financing." 

Commenting on the financial results, David O'Neil, Vice President of
Finance continued, "Our operating losses for the 1st Quarter of 2007
were $3.0 million as compared to $3.2 million in the same period of
2006. This decrease in losses is primarily attributed to lower cost of
product in our Applied Technology division partially offset by the costs
associated with the wind down of the products produced in our now closed
Worcester facility. We continue to increase our direct investment
spending in R&D with a modest increase of $0.1 million to $0.7 million
in Q1 2007, primarily to support the development of new products in our
solar inverter line and to develop new products in our Electronics
division. Our SG&A costs are down by $0.5 million or 19% primarily in
our corporate costs of legal and other fees, and reduced payroll and
overhead costs." 

"We continue to take steps to reduce our overhead spending while
increasing our revenues and order backlog," concluded Eisenhaure. "We
have set some high expectations for ourselves but, given where we are
today, we are confident that we can achieve those objectives with the
proper financing. We expect that we will achieve those objectives
primarily driven by the growth in alternative energy markets,
particularly photovoltaic inverters."

Our SG&A costs are down by $0.5 million or 19% primarily in our corporate costs of legal and other fees, and reduced payroll and overhead costs." </p><p>"We continue to take steps to reduce our overhead spending while increasing our revenues and order backlog," concluded Eisenhaure. "We have set some high expectations for ourselves but, given where we are today, we are confident that we can achieve those objectives with the proper financing. We expect that we will achieve those objectives primarily driven by the growth in alternative energy markets, particularly photovoltaic inverters." </p><p>About SatCon Technology Corporation </p><p>SatCon Technology Corporation is a developer and manufacturer of electronics and motors for the Alternative Energy, Hybrid-Electric Vehicle, Grid Support, High Reliability Electronics and Advanced Power Technology markets.
