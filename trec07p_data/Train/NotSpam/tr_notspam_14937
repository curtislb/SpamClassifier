Sounds good.

Security by hand-waving :)

A lot of crypto out there relies on hashes of keys. If the key is random
(enough), then the hash should be good enough not to collide. At least,
not in predictable ways...

Why though is it a hash of the base64? In theory the base64s have the
same entropy as the keys, but the crypto stuff should be happening in
binary land unless we get into XML.

If changing it will break the mesh for everybody at some point "before
we ship", sooner's better than later.

In http://www.nist.gov/sha, NIST states:
"Federal agencies should stop using SHA-1 for digital signatures,
digital time stamping and other applications that require collision
resistance as soon as practical, and must use the SHA-2 family of hash
functions for these applications after 2010."

We probably won't have a NIST-blessed replacement for SHA before 2012.
Nevertheless, we need to allow for changes along the way.

IMO we need to allow for some algorithm agility here. Breaking the mesh
at any stage is going to be very unpleasant - for the users^Wkids
especially.

For the unique identifier stuff, could we at some future point do a
'keyid2/' (or some other prefix) meaning that this is an identifier in a
different space?

Anyway, the patch looks good.
