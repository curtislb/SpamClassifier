Hello list,
I may have to leave tomorrow night at around 5 PM MST.
I'm going to be brutally forced in to using a console for.. everything.
So, I've got a couple questions.
I know i can pass sftsynth as an argument on the kernel command line.
But, what do I have to do, in order to get flite working with speakup?
Also, how good is lynx with browsing the internet?
Any help is really appriciated,
Thanks,
~~TheCreator~~
