You are right that I am trying to connect to a Windows m/c from a Solaris
server.

But when I used the below code, it gets connected but I am having problem
displaying the output:


 my $telnet = Net::Telnet->new(HOST => "$server",
                Dump_log => "telnetdump.txt",
                PROMPT => '/[>]/');
 $telnet->login('user', 'pass');
 $telnet->cmd('ls -l >lsop.log');

after running this program, lsop.log is being created but I don't see
anything in it.

If I can display the output, I am all good. Please suggest!!!

Thanks in Advance.

Regards,
Lakshmi

If you are trying to connect to the "telnet" server that comes with
Microsoft OSes then you are SOL.  If you are trying to connect to a
different telnet server, then please provide the name of the server
and operating system it is running under so we can duplicate your
environment.

from Perldoc Net::Telnet
       Connecting to a Remote MS-Windows Machine

       By default MS-Windows doesn't come with a TELNET server.  However
third
       party TELNET servers are available.  Unfortunately many of these
       servers falsely claim to be a TELNET server.  This is especially true
       of the so-called "Microsoft Telnet Server" that comes installed with
       some newer versions MS-Windows.

       When a TELNET server first accepts a connection, it must use the
ASCII
       control characters carriage-return and line-feed to start a new line
       (see RFC854).  A server like the "Microsoft Telnet Server" that
doesn't
       do this, isn't a TELNET server.  These servers send ANSI terminal
       escape sequences to position to a column on a subsequent line and to
       even position while writing characters that are adjacent to each
other.
       Worse, when sending output these servers resend previously sent
command
       output in a misguided attempt to display an entire terminal screen.

       Connecting Net::Telnet to one of these false TELNET servers makes
your
       job of parsing command output very difficult.  It's better to replace
a
       false TELNET server with a real TELNET server.  The better TELNET
       servers for MS-Windows allow you to avoid the ANSI escapes by turning
       off something some of them call console mode.
