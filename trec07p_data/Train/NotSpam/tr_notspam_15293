That's two people that have given the same list, but both
have omitted the more common (in modern times) phrase "hash
browned potatos" which is a hash of chopped potato, onion,
and sometimetimes other things fried brown.  I'll ignore the
McDonald's version which hashes together just the potatos,
since a collective of a single element is still a collective
mathematically, but not usually considered so linguistically
unless you've got a big enough advertising budget to pull it
off.
