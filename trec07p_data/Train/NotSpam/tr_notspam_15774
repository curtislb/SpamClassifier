Diebe klauten Kreuz vom Altar der Schlosskirche

CHEMNITZ - Kunstdiebstahl unter den Augen des Herrn: In der Schlosskirche
haben Ganoven ein Kupferkreuz mitgehen lassen - direkt vom Altar. Ein Fall
f?r die Kripo.

Christoph Weber (48), Pfarrer der St.-Pauli-Schloss-kirchgemeinde, ist
sauer. ?Unsere Kirche steht allen Besuchern offen - und eigentlich verlassen
wir uns auf ihren Respekt vor den im Haus stehenden Dingen.? Doch das fremde
Eigentum war den Dieben am Nachmittag wohl nicht sonderlich heilig. Objekt
ihrer Begierde: ein 30 Zentimeter hohes kupfernes Kreuz, daran befestigt aus
Emaille der Corpus Christi. K?nstler Helmut Senf schuf es 1971 in Erfurt.
?Auch wenn vielleicht der reine Materialwert mit 500 Euro nicht sonderlich
hoch erscheint, so ist es f?r uns doch ein wesentlich h?herer ideeller Wert,
der dahintersteht?, sagt Pfarrer Weber.

Unklar, ob das Kreuz mit Absicht gestohlen worden ist oder ob ein
jugendlicher Schabernack dahinter steckt. Doch die Kirche war nicht das
erste Mal Zielscheibe krimineller Ener-gien. Erst vor zwei Wochen hatten
n?chtliche Besucher eine Scheibe eingeschlagen, waren ins Haus gedrungen.
Beute machten sie allerdings keine. Jetzt ermittelt die Kripo. Sprecher
Frank Fischer (51): ?Wir suchen Zeugen, die etwas bemerkt haben.? Hinweise:

14 weltber?hmte Gem?lde in Banksafe entdeckt 

Z?RICH. 14 Gem?lde von weltber?hmten Malern fand die Polizei nach einem
Hinweis in einem Banksafe in Z?rich. Die teuren Werke waren seit der NS-Zeit
verschwunden.

Einem spektakul?ren Fall von Kunstraub w?hrend der Zeit des
Nationalsozialismus sind nach einem Zeitungsbericht die Z?rcher
Justizbeh?rden auf der Spur. Die Staatsanwaltschaft fand in einem Bank-Safe
mindestens 14 Gem?lde von Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Claude Monet, Oskar
Kokoschka und anderen ber?hmten Malern, wie die ?S?ddeutsche Zeitung?
(Freitagausgabe) berichtete.

Der Safe geh?rte demnach dem Kunsthistoriker Bruno Lohse, der w?hrend des
Zweiten Weltkrieges im besetzten Frankreich Kunstwerke f?r Hermann G?rings
Privatsammlung konfiszierte, zumeist aus j?dischem Besitz. Die Gem?lde seien
beschlagnahmt worden und m?ssten nun auf ihre Echtheit ?berpr?ft werden.

Lohse war im M?rz im Alter von 95 Jahren in M?nchen gestorben. Der Fall war
ans Licht gekommen, weil ein M?nchner Kunsth?ndler ein im Weltkrieg
gestohlenes und sp?ter angeblich ?ber Lohse erworbenes Bild der Erbin zum
R?ckkauf angeboten hatte. Den Safe in Z?rich hatte Lohse dem Bericht zufolge
im Jahr 1978 angemietet. In Liechtenstein laufen zudem Ermittlungen wegen
einer Stiftung namens ?Sch?nart-Anstalt?, in die Lohse sein Verm?gen
einbrachte.

Swiss raid bank safe belonging to late Nazi art thief


2007-06-01 18:58:50 - 


ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) - Paintings from a Swiss bank safe linked to a
notorious Nazi art thief have been confiscated as part of an investigation
into whether the heir of a Jewish art collector was blackmailed, authorities
said Friday.

The Zurich prosecutor's office said it raided the safe as part of a
three-nation probe of a German art dealer accused of conspiring with an
American art historian to withhold a painting by French impressionist
Camille Pissarro from its rightful owner unless she paid a finder's fee
equal to 18 percent of its value.

Prosecutor Ivo Hoppler said the safe was rented by a trust based in the
neighboring principality of Liechtenstein and was accessed by Bruno Lohse,
who spirited away art from all over Europe during World War II on behalf of
Hermann Goering, Hitler's top aide.

Lohse died two months ago in Munich.

Confirming reports in the Swiss weekly ?Cash? and German daily ?Sueddeutsche
Zeitung,? Hoppler said Zurich officials were acting on a judicial assistance
request from Munich prosecutors, who are investigating how the unidentified
art dealer obtained Pissarro's ?Le Quai Malaquais, Printemps.?

The painting was stolen from Jewish publisher Samuel Fischer in 1938. The
investigation began on a complaint from his niece, who was not identified.

Sueddeutsche Zeitung estimated the value of the painting at ?5 million
(US$6.7 million). That would put the fee demanded by the men at ?900,000
(US$1.2 million).

The paper said the German dealer claimed to have acquired the painting from
Lohse in good faith in the 1950s.

Munich chief prosecutor Christian Schmidt-Sommerfeld said the dealer
contested the blackmail accusation and argued that requesting a finder's fee
was normal in such cases.

Schmidt-Sommerfeld said the investigation does not extend to the art
historian because he is an American citizen and his alleged crimes would
have been committed outside Germany.

Hoppler said he could not yet confirm whether the Pissarro piece was among
those found in the safe kept at the Zuercher Kantonalbank. He said he would
inform prosecutors in Munich and Liechtenstein of his findings by early next
week.

'Meathead' call solves artwork mystery 

The words "it is the meathead here" were music to artist Barry Bailey's ears
when a deeply embarrassed friend confessed to removing a driftwood ship
artwork originally feared stolen from Paekakariki Beach. 

Mr Bailey was delighted to get the call from the local businessman, who did
not want to be identified. 

The man said he "freaked out" when he saw a report in The Dominion Post this
week quoting Mr Bailey's fear that his gift to the community had been stolen
by "a meathead". 

Mr Bailey believed his 2.4-metre Cutty Sark replica, made of driftwood and
with calico sails, had suffered the bad luck that the real ship had just
encountered. 

The Cutty Sark, the world's last remaining tea clipper, was badly damaged in
a fire in London last month. 

Mr Bailey had feared his driftwood ship had been stolen within an hour of
him screwing it to a log on the beach last weekend. It was designed as a
gift to the community. 

It has now been revealed that a friend of his removed it to protect it from
ferocious weather conditions, putting it in his garage. 

The friend, who often spoke to Mr Bailey on the beach, planned to tell him
he had rescued the artwork the next time they met, and to also discuss
putting it in a more protected spot. 

To remove the work, the friend had to unscrew it from a large log at the
southern end of the beach. "I wanted to save it from big tides - the sea
would have destroyed it," the friend said. 

Mr Bailey said he was rapt. "I feared it had met the same fate as the Cutty
Sark and gone up in flames." 

He planned to meet residents to decide on a safer location. It could be in
the town centre, but he would still prefer the sculpture to be on the beach
in the sea air where the waves could lap around it - in a more protected
spot.

Roban documentos hist?ricos del siglo XIX en Atlixco, Puebla
Notimex / La Jornada On Line 

02/06/2007 15:33

Atlixco, Pue. El archivo municipal de esta ciudad sufri? el robo de cerca de
300 hojas con valor hist?rico, mismas que podr?an ya estar en el mercado
negro, inform? Agust?n Ayaquica, encargado del inmueble.

En entrevista, inform? que desde el pasado mi?rcoles se percat? del faltante
de las hojas que se caracterizan por contar con sellos que datan de los a?os
de 1810 a 1870.

Indic? que los documentos refieren la historia del municipio, por ello la
importancia de los mismas, aunque desconoce qui?n o qui?nes pudieron haber
sido los responsables del robo.

Agust?n Ayaquica lament? que con este hecho se mutile parte de la historia

Se?al? que las autoridades municipales y estatales ya fueron enteradas del
hecho por lo que espera que en breve se d? con los responsables, aunque
reconoci? que este robo se suma o otros de objetos hist?ricos ocurridos
anteriormente.

?La riqueza que tenemos en el archivo es tan valiosa como la de un banco,
pero lamentablemente las autoridades no lo ven as?, mucho menos en los
templos de donde tambi?n se han llevado varias pinturas?, dijo.

El encargado del archivo agreg? que a la falta de inter?s de los
ayuntamientos, hay que sumarle el deterioro de las instalaciones, donde se
puede observar humedad, abandono y orden.

El municipio de Atlixco se localiza al centro-oeste del estado de Puebla, y
se caracteriza por su clima privilegiado, por lo que el lema de la ciudad es
?El mejor clima del mundo?.

Entre los principales atractivos que destacan est? el ex convento de El
Carmen, del siglo XVI, as? como sus viveros donde se aprecian plantas y
flores multicolores.

An Idea Whose Time Has Come?
The model for art ownership protection: Real-estate title insurance
By STEVE YAHN

In a celebrated case reported at length in this newspaper, a Norman Rockwell
painting that had been hanging in the home of movie mogul Steven Spielberg
turned out to be stolen, and the Hollywood tycoon pledged to return the
"Russian Schoolroom" painting to its rightful owner. Done by Rockwell on a
trip to Russia, the canvas shows a group of Russian schoolchildren
contemplating a white bust of Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin.

Mr. Spielberg's promise has become embroiled in a legal battle between two
claimants to the work, with the Federal Bureau of Investigation caught in
the middle between these two parties and Mr. Spielberg, who is holding the
painting in the meantime. What isn't so well known is that if Mr. Spielberg
had been able to purchase something called "art title insurance," his
defenses would be in a lot better shape than they are now.

Art title insurance is an old notion, says Richard Gray, co-owner of Richard
Gray Gallery in New York and Chicago and the unofficial dean of American
gallerists. But only with the rise of attention generated by art stolen
during the Holocaust and quite recently reclaimed, as well as the surge of
disputes surrounding looted antiquities -- not to mention the booming art
market in general -- has this concept sprung to life in new forms.

For example, one potential dispute that was amicably resolved led to the
recent return of J.M.W. Turner's painting "Glaucus and Scylla" by the
Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas, to the heirs of John and Anna
Jaffe. This occurred after an investigation into the provenance of the
painting, which had been in the museum's collection since 1966, revealed
that it had been seized by the pro-Nazi Vichy regime in France in 1943.

Not long ago, John Singleton Copley's portrait of William Posonby, second
earl of Bessborough, was returned to Harvard University more than 30 years
after it was reported missing. The painting belonged to the estate of
private collector William M.V. Kingsland, who died in March. This, too,
could have been a source of dispute but was resolved when Alexander Acevedo,
an art dealer, bought the painting from the estate and gave it to Harvard.

Art title insurance functions in a fashion similar to real-estate title
insurance, protecting a policyholder's right to title though not
guaranteeing the authenticity of a work of art. Title is title, but a
"Monet" could be by Monet himself or by a knock-off artist.

Why didn't the idea of art title insurance stick until recently? The short
answer is that there has never been enough demand. "There isn't enough
volume for art title and authenticity insurance, since demand is so low you
don't get enough premium to offset a potential loss. So you have to charge a
lot of money, and that charge is almost unaffordable to the majority of
people who would rather self-insure the risk," says LeConte Moore, managing
director and fine arts specialist at New York-based DeWitt Stern Group.

"I will say, though," notes Mr. Moore, one of the top fine-arts brokers in
the world, "that there is much more renewed interest in this insurance today
because paintings and photographs have escalated in value far beyond what
anybody imagined. So there are a lot of people concerned about it and
questioning whether they should buy the insurance."

Somebody who tried and failed to promote a form of art title insurance was
Lloyd Goldenberg, an attorney with Bryne Goldenberg & Hamilton in
Washington. In the late 1990s, a group Mr. Goldenberg was a member of tried
to sell a service to bank trust departments that made multiple inquiries
into the marketplace value of a work of art and then proposed to issue a
certificate of title based on those findings.

But the marketplace wasn't ready. Says Mr. Goldenberg: "The marketplace --
and these are sophisticated people -- just doesn't treat art, this type of
asset, the same way they treat all other types of assets. They seem to treat
it as art first, and an asset second, living in this Never Never Land in
which they're going to trust their reputable dealers and auction houses
above all else. The dealers and auction houses might be reputable, but they
don't guarantee title."

Yet another firm that tried to promote the notion of art title insurance was
mighty Hiscox, a syndicate of Lloyd's of London and perhaps the premier name
in art insurance in the world. Hiscox's downfall was that given the nature
of its business, it had to renew art title contracts on an annual basis, and
most customers were looking for the life-of-ownership protection that comes
with owning title to a home in the U.S.

So what has changed? A fledgling but well-backed insurer called ARIS Corp.
entered the market last June. To date it has not signed up any clients
(though some major candidates are pending), but it has attracted plenty of
support, including at Hiscox, which is serving as its reinsurer.

"I've always felt there's a market there" for insuring against defective
title, says Robert Read, fine-art underwriter at Hiscox and arguably the
most influential arts-insurance practitioner in the world. "It's a real
issue, and we like the product ARIS has put together. They spent an enormous
amount of time with their due diligence."

ARIS is the result of the brother-and-sister collaboration of its chairman,
Lawrence Shindell, and president, Judith Pearson. The heart of what the two
are offering is title protection; research and vetting services; and payment
of all the expenses of a legal defense should one become necessary.

Differing from Hiscox's former method of operation, an ARIS policy covers
the full lifetime ownership of a work. If a work of art is proved to have
bad title and must be returned, ARIS will pay for its full value -- as would
have been the case in the Spielberg instance.

With all the disputed art claims around, maybe this is the time that art
title insurance will catch on.

recently named Editor, Special Projects of ArtCalendar magazine.

Coins gone from state museum 
Officials want to know what happened to the rare 'trial strikes' from 1867.

By TOM ALEX
REGISTER STAFF WRITER


June 1, 2007

Twenty-seven rare 1867 coins worth more than $150,000 are missing from their
designated storage spot at the Iowa State Historical Building.

Retiree V.E. "Felix" Augspurger of Des Moines has been asking about them in
recent years and says he finally was told that their whereabouts are
unknown.

Nearly 40 years ago, Augspurger was a state employee who helped arrange a
display for the coins at the state's former historical building. For the
past few years, he has been trying to find out what happened to them.

"At this point, we know the coins are not in their appropriate place," said
Jeff Morgan, a spokesman for the museum. It's unclear whether they were
misplaced or stolen.

Jim Saunders, spokesman for the Iowa Department of Public Safety, said he
could find no report indicating the coins had been stolen, but when he
checked with the staff of the State Historical Building this week, he
learned that the coins were missing.

"The Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation is interested in pursuing that
information," he said. "If anyone knows anything about the coins, we'd like
to have them call the DCI." The phone number is 725-6010.

The coins are copper trial strikes made from dies used some 140 years ago by
the U.S. Mint. Trial strikes were often made in lighter metals as
presentation pieces; the process let the U.S. Mint show what the coins for
the next year were going to look like. The collection included two examples
of each coin so both sides could be displayed at one time.

It's not the first time something has gone missing at the State Historical
Building. In 1997, staff members reported Civil War-era firearms were
missing. Some eventually were found in a storage area, but others still are
missing, Saunders said. In the past three years, some documents went missing
from the building. They later were located, and an arrest was made.

Morgan said security officers no longer patrol the building day and night as
they did before budget cuts of the early '90s.

"We are eager to work with the (DCI) to develop leads," he said, referring
to the missing coins.

Four of the original 34 copper trial strike coins are still in the museum's
permanent collection of 110,000 artifacts.

Here's what museum officials know:

The coin collection was checked after the guns went missing in 1997.

In 1998, it was noted that the coins were not in the spot listed for them.

Nine years later, an investigation is being launched.

The coins apparently came to Iowa through John Kasson, a U.S. representative
from Iowa who was chairman of the Committee on Coinage, Weights and
Measures. He also was first assistant postmaster general in President
Abraham Lincoln's administration in 1861.

It's not known whether the coins were on display in Iowa in the late 1800s,
but when they were rediscovered in 1961, they looked awful.

Former State Curator Jack Musgrove found the coins in a cardboard box and
gave them to Augspurger, who remembers taking them home and cleaning them in
his kitchen. Augspurger said he knew that cleaning coins is not recommended,
but he said that at the time he had no choice. The coins were badly
tarnished and were covered with some kind of dark material.

John Holden of Garwin made a special display case for the coins in the shape
of the state of Iowa. The collection included pennies, 2-cent pieces, 3-cent
pieces, half dimes, dimes, quarters, half dollars, and "gold coins" (made of
copper) in all denominations. The $20 trial strike pieces are worth about
$11,000 each today, according to Steve Contursi, president of Rare Coin
Wholesalers of Dana Point, Calif. He estimated the value of a complete
collection of cleaned trial strikes from 1867 at $176,000.

Web list to track thieves

NIGEL HUNT
June 03, 2007 12:15am

POLICE will get more than $2 million in this week's State Budget for a
compulsory online register for all secondhand dealers to combat
housebreakers

The move will provide police with a real-time list of property sold to
secondhand dealers or lodged at pawn shops - allowing them to track stolen
goods and find the thieves rapidly. 
Online transaction recording systems are used successfully in Western
Australia, Queensland and NSW, and also in Vancouver, Canada.

Those systems - expected to be the base for SA's register - also allow
automatic matching with the police database of stolen property.

They will have the ability to flag suspected stolen items with individual
investigators, who are instantly notified via an email or mobile phone.

Police Minister Paul Holloway said it was expected the initiative would
enhance the ability of police to "further reduce crime" in the community.

"This will improve the productivity of police resources through electronic
data collection, powerful database queries and automation of time-consuming
comparisons against stolen property records," he said.

"Police will be able to spend less time sifting through receipts and data
and more time enforcing the law."

Mr Holloway and Police Commissioner Mal Hyde last year examined the
state-of-the-art online register in Vancouver - called Xtract - and were
impressed with its results.

In 2001, its first year of operation, Vancouver police increased their
identification and recovery rate of stolen property by 300 per cent and
reduced property crime and theft from vehicles by 16 per cent.

Preliminary SA police statistics show, to the end of April this financial
year, there were 10,119 reported house breakings - a decrease of 8.2 per
cent from the 11,023 reported in the same period the previous financial
year.

Mr Holloway said if the introduction of the online register in SA resulted
in the same crime reduction reported in Vancouver there would be a
significant reduction in such offences as residential house-breaking,
non-residential break-ins and theft from vehicles.

"The consensus of international research is that the movement of stolen
property through the secondhand dealing and pawnbroking industries can be
limited through stringent licence controls and a real-time web-based
transaction reporting system that allows cross-matching with police
records," he said.

As part of the new measure, the Government also intended to amend the Second
Hand Dealers and Pawnbrokers Act to restrict trading hours for such
premises.

In May last year, the Sunday Mail revealed police concerns about the
operation of Silversun Loans and Hire at Richmond - Adelaide's only 24-hour
secondhand shop.

A resource-intensive operation by Sturt police around the South Rd premises
found people from across the metropolitan area were travelling to Silversun
to sell property.

Amendments to the legislation will include measures to regulate scrap metal
dealers to include them in the online register.

"The government has no mercy for businesses which support theft and criminal
activity by buying stolen goods from criminals," Mr Holloway said.

Pertenecen a un cient?fico marplatense radicado en los EE.UU. 
Investigan el robo de 12 cuadros de pintores famosos 

La Justicia local e Interpol investigan el posible accionar de una
organizaci?n dedicada al robo de objetos de arte, que sustrajo del
departamento de un particular 12 cuadros de pintores argentinos famosos que
est?n valuados en 30 mil d?lares.  
 

  02.06.07 

La Justicia local investiga el hurto de 12 cuadros de pintores argentinos de
renombre que, en total, fueron valuados en 30.000 d?lares, los que se
hallaban guardados en el interior del departamento de un cient?fico local
radicado desde hace unos a?os en los Estados Unidos. Como se registraron
hechos similares en galer?as de arte de Mar del Plata y en otras casas
particulares, no se descarte que sea obra de una organizaci?n delictiva
dedicada a este rubro. Sin embargo, el abanico de sospechas abarca otras
posibilidades.
Los familiares del damnificado, Gerardo Vasta, con el patrocinio de los
abogados C?sar Ventimiglia y Fortunato de la Plaza, presentaron la denuncia
ante el fiscal de la Oficina de Determinaci?n de Autores, Fabi?n Bel?n,
quien inici? una pesquisa dando intervenci?n a la Polic?a Internacional
(Interpol) a fin de establecer si las obras de arte permanecen aqu? o
salieron del pa?s en busca de compradores en el extranjero.
Al ser consultado, el doctor Ventimiglia explic? que "nuestro representado
hab?a adquirido estas obras de arte y las ten?a guardadas en su departamento
de Gasc?n y C?rdoba. El caso es que al ir a buscarlas para trasladarlas a
otro lugar, se encontr? con que ya no estaban m?s. Inmediatamente, nos dio a
conocer el hecho, y nosotros presentamos la denuncia ante la Justicia Penal,
a fin de que se investigue d?nde se encuentran y qui?nes fueron los autores
del delito".

Organizaci?n delictiva

En cuanto a si pudo ser obra de una organizaci?n dedicada a la sustracci?n
de objetos de arte, el interlocutor se?al? que "es una de las hip?tesis con
la que se trabaja, pero no la ?nica. Las dem?s no podemos revelarlas, para
que no se frustre la investigaci?n que realiza, con muy buena
predisposici?n, el fiscal Bel?n".
Destac? que "al darse a conocer esta investigaci?n, y que la polic?a y la
Justicia est?n detr?s de variadas pistas, la venta en el mercado negro se
ver? impedida o restringida, por lo que posiblemente si los autores de este
hecho no tienen ya compradores, tengan que vender en conjunto a un precio
con el que no comprar?an ni una sola de estas".
-?Hay en la Argentina antecedentes de la existencia de organizaciones
dedicadas al robo de objetos de arte?
-Particularmente, en Mar del Plata no conocemos ning?n precedente del caso.
Pero seguramente se trata de gente que conoce de arte, porque si fueran
ladrones comunes se hubieran llevado art?culos electr?nicos u otros. Pero
con los cuadros lo tiene que hacer alguien que sepa de su valor y que tenga
la posibilidad de qued?rselos sin despertar sospecha o venderlos a alg?n
coleccionista que tiene individualizado. De otro modo, ser?a raro que se
arriesgara, teniendo en cuenta que est? cometiendo un delito...
-Teniendo en cuenta que los cuadros estaban bajo llave dentro de un cuarto
cerrado, ?sobre qui?n o qui?nes se ciernen las mayores sospechas?
- No podemos revelar nada al respecto, porque forma parte de la
investigaci?n...
-Sin embargo, ?habr?a un c?rculo de sospechosos bastante definido?
- La Fiscal?a estar?a haciendo alg?n tipo de relevamiento sobre qu? personas
tuvieron acceso al departamento donde se guardaban los cuadros.

Sin despertar sospechas

- ?Cu?ndo y c?mo habr?a sido el hecho?
- Por supuesto que no tenemos precisiones, pero sucedi? hace un par de
meses. Los ladrones ingresaron a la casa (no podemos tampoco decir nada
sobre si forzaron o no la cerradura, porque algunas fueron cambiadas) y
aparentando una mudanza, se llevaron los cuadros que tuvieron que cargar en
un veh?culo. Posiblemente, haya alg?n testigo de esa maniobra.
- ?Se ha detectado alg?n mercado donde comercializar estos art?culos?
- Seg?n tenemos entendido, existe un mercado negro en Capital, donde hay
coleccionistas que realizan inversiones importantes en objetos de arte. Pero
en el orden internacional, es muy amplio. Al margen de ello confiamos en que
Interpol tenga detectadas las posibles bocas de venta.
- ?Ahora, hay que esperar que la investigaci?n d? sus frutos o ya hay alguna
pista m?s o menos firme?
- Sabemos que el fiscal Bel?n dispuso una serie de medidas que se estar?an
cumpliendo y se recibir?an testimoniales para establecer cu?ndo fueron
sustra?dos los cuadros. Pensamos que hay testigos importantes que pudieron
haber visto la supuesta mudanza con que se simul? la comisi?n del delito.

Las obras sustra?das

Como para alertar a la poblaci?n para que no adquiera las obras sustra?das,
el doctor Ventimiglia dio la lista completa con sus respectivos autores
(entre par?ntesis):
"Figura en descanso" (Carpani), "Potros" (Castagnino), "Desnudo" (Diz).
"Paisaje" (Fara), "Colla y ni?o" (Frexas), "Tetera negra" (Mastro), "Calle
de pueblo" (Pierri), "Desnudo" y "Retrato de L.T. Ag?ero" (Presas), "Desnudo
sentado" y "Desnudo recostado" (S?nchez), y "Jarr?n con flores" (Lumerman),
adem?s de cuatro marcos bru?idos.

'The Medici Conspiracy' co-author discusses art looting in Italy     
By Patricia Arrigon    Saturday, June 02 2007, 12:41 AM EDT    Views: 64  
 
MEDICI CONSPIRACY Italian journalist Cecilia Todeschini became involved in
the question of art looting when she was asked to do some research for a
television documentary about Peter Watson's work on the subject. Eventually
the two co-authored "The Medici Conspiracy: the Illicit Journey of Looted
Antiquities From Italy's Tomb Raiders to the World's Great Museums" (Public
Affairs).

In a recent conversation with Todeschini, she talked first about Giacomo
Medici, an Italian already convicted in 2004 for smuggling and selling
ancient antiquities. He has been sentenced to 10 years in prison plus given
a 10 million euro fine, but he is still waiting for his court appeal to be
resolved. He declares himself innocent on all charges. 

"He served, I believe, six days in 1995 or '96," Todeschini said. "There are
some legal problems over a law passed by the former Berlusconi government
which shortens the statute of limitations and has been challenged as being
unconstitutional if applied unequally. He can't leave the country, though." 

 
EXPOSED IT ALL She also discussed the ongoing trial in Rome of Marion True,
former curator of antiquities of the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif.,
and Robert Hecht Jr., another American who lives in Europe, for conspiracy
to traffic in illegal antiquities. In November 2006, the government of
Greece added their charges against True of knowingly buying a stolen ancient
artifact, a golden wreath, which was sold to the Getty for $1.15 million in
1993. 

"The situation involves me personally," Todeschini said, "because anybody
who cares about history and culture and the knowledge that our past can give
us finds it unacceptable that curators of great museums have bought objects
they could not have not known were looted. They should be the ones to
protect archaeology. 

"For decades they were the buyers who could pay millions of dollars and by
doing so encouraged looters to destroy tomb after tomb. I find this very
difficult to forgive, even more than the tomb robbers. I hold them less
responsible than a great collector or archaeologist who considers himself a
protector of art. 

"I have seen dozens of looted tombs in Puglia (Apulia in ancient times), and
it makes your hair stand on end. There is total destruction. There are tooth
marks of mechanical diggers in the structures. These structures could have
told us so much if they had not been brutally emptied of sizable artifacts.
Only broken vases are sometimes found. 

"Archaeologists know this. How could they have allowed it to happen?" 

She credits some museums with doing the right thing, however. 

"The Boston Museum of Fine Arts returned 13 objects to Italy, amongst which
were three Apulian vases and six magnificent Attic vases. There was also a
statue of Vibia Sabina, Emperor Hadrian's wife, over 2 meters high. 

"I was there when the artifacts were shown to the press in Rome on Sept. 28,
2006. Malcolm Rogers, director of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, who
returned them said, 'This is the beginning of a new era.' He meant that
looted art would no longer be bought and stolen artifacts would be returned
to their origin. I thanked him as an Italian. 

"'That era is finished,' he said. Now the Boston Museum has signed an
agreement for loans of archaeological artifacts from Italy to be shown in
their museum. The Italian minister of culture went to Boston and brought
objects for a long-term loan." 

Other situations have increased the hope that the selling of looted
artifacts has become more difficult. 

"A couple of months ago it was made public that 12 slabs of marble from a
first century B.C. funerary monument with carvings in bas-relief of
gladiators had been discovered," she said. "These were terribly important.
It turned out that the slabs had been on the market for four years and had
found no buyers. Fifteen years ago there would have been a race to buy them
up. 

"They were found by chance by an Italian man digging a road in Fiano Romano
near Rome. He was not a professional tomb robber, but he did not notify
authorities because he thought this could make him a fortune. He
photographed and then reburied 11 of the slabs and left one to show to
prospective buyers. They turned out to be too important to be sold. The man
was caught red-handed and finally took authorities to the site when he had
dug them up. 

"The fact that there was not a single buyer, I believe, is the result of the
court cases now going on. It has become very clear that no museum will buy
looted archaeological artifacts from Greece or Italy, but will they still
purchase unprovenanced items from places like Iraq, Afghanistan, Peru,
Mexico, Egypt or Syria?" 

Todeschini is encouraged by current Italian inquiries. 

"Gen. Roberto Conforti, when he was the head of the Italian Carabinieri Art
Unit, was an extraordinary driving force in these investigations. His
suggestion of establishing a legal international market for antiquities in
which all items for sale would first be registered with appropriate
governments, could be effective. It might not be easy to do this. If we aim
sky high, we might reach something halfway up. Each object would be approved
by the country of origin." 

As to the famous pottery fragments of vases sold to the Getty museum: "They
are what the tombaroli (tomb raiders) call 'little orphans.' I can't say if
they were deliberately broken. Most vases are found in fragments. If any are
found intact, they would probably be found in Italy in a chamber tomb. 

"I grew up in Cape Town, South Africa. When I returned to Italy over 40
years ago, I was in Southern Italy, in Calabria, and working in an entirely
different field. One night at a dinner party the conversation turned to
plowing fields and sometimes finding artifacts or tombs. A man said, 'We
break the vases, then number the pieces. It makes it easier to send them to
Switzerland.' 

"These pieces that are found may have been deliberately broken or broken
during an unscientific dig. Often if they are fragments of a very important
vase, when the vase is put together, several pieces are held back. The buyer
is then shown a Polaroid photo of a missing piece. There are several known
cases of this. The owner of the vase would pay anything to get the missing
fragment and complete the vase. 

"According to Getty documents, that museum purchased fragments of the
priceless Euphronious/Onesimos red-figured Attic kylix depicting scenes of
the Trojan War (a drinking vessel that was returned to Italy in 1999) over a
period of 10 years. It is difficult to maintain they were not aware that the
fragments were looted. The dealer would not put all the fragments onto the
market, but they would photograph the missing pieces. They would be used as
a hook - 'You buy this vase and I will give you this fragment.' 

"The fragments were split among the dealers, such as Robert Hecht, Giacomo
Medici and others. Although they were rivals, they worked together. They
would say, 'You can sell it on my behalf.' 

Todeschini acknowledges that she has not heard back from any of the museum
curators or trustees to whom she and co-author Watson sent "The Medici
Conspiracy." 

"The book has not gone down very well with the museum curators and
directors, but we see the beginning of the end to this disgraceful epic. An
object is beautiful, it tells a story, but it tells us nothing about the
family in whose tomb it was found or about other objects in the tomb. 

"Some years ago I visited the Etruscan Museum in Rome to see an exhibit.
Among the objects on display was a simple silver earring like kids wear
today, one of many on an ear. Because the dig was done scientifically, they
went in with a pathologist who examined the bones and found they were male.
So it was determined that the earring was worn by a man clear back then. If
that dig had been done by a looter, he would have gotten nothing for the
earring, so he would probably have discarded it and we would not have known
that." 

A paperback edition of "The Medici Conspiracy" that will be released June 11
contains a new chapter on Greece written by Nikolas Zirganos, a Greek
investigative journalist, that parallels the looting of tombs in Italy,
smuggling and selling the stolen ancient artifacts.

Police called in on theft of museum money
By Ashley Bach

Seattle Times Eastside bureau

Bellevue police are now involved in the investigation into how at least
$200,000 was embezzled from the Bellevue Arts Museum.

Museum officials told supporters last month that the museum's chief
financial officer had stolen the money, but they didn't want police
investigating while they sorted things out internally and worked with the
employee on a restitution plan. They changed their minds last week and filed
a police report, according to Bellevue police spokesman Greg Grannis.

Museum officials contacted police and filed a claim notice with their
insurance company "to move us closer to resolving this matter and obtaining
a full financial recovery for the museum," wrote museum Executive Director
Michael Monroe in a letter sent to supporters this week.

The internal investigation may be over before Bellevue police come on board.
An outside attorney and forensic accountant hired to look into the museum's
accounting controls and policies may be finished with their probe in about
two weeks, officials said.

The Bellevue fraud detective assigned to the case is on vacation and busy
with other cases and may not get started for a couple of weeks, Grannis
said.

It's still unclear how much money was stolen from the museum. Officials
originally estimated about $200,000, but the exact amount is now up in the
air, said museum Deputy Director Renate Raymond.

According to a Bellevue police report, more than $284,000 was stolen between
October 2005 and April 2007. The chief financial officer worked for the
museum for two years before resigning last month.

(The Seattle Times is not naming the financial officer because she has not
been charged with a crime and has not been publicly identified by the
museum.)

Museum officials said this week they've already made several changes to
their accounting controls. For instance, they don't allow the acting
financial officer to sign checks and they improved the way they record
donations, Raymond said.

The museum closed less than four years ago because of weak leadership, low
attendance and accounting problems. Since it reopened in June 2005, a new
set of leaders has been luring back donors and mounting a new slate of
exhibits.

Ex-Cosmosphere chief working after conviction
Associated Press

OKLAHOMA CITY - The man who was convicted of stealing artifacts from the
Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center has been working occasionally for a
museum in Oklahoma City, according to a published report.

Max Ary, who is free as he appeals his conviction and three-year prison
term, has been used periodically as a consultant, Don Otto, executive
director of the Omniplex science center, told The Oklahoman on Friday.

Ary started putting together some of the space exhibits when he served as
director at Omniplex. He was placed on leave after being indicted in April
2005; then his contract as director was not renewed when it expired several
months later.

Ary, founder and former director of the Kansas Cosmosphere, was accused of
stealing artifacts from the Hutchinson museum and NASA. A jury convicted Ary
in November 2005 on 12 counts, including theft of government property, wire
and mail fraud, interstate transport of stolen goods and money laundering.
He was ordered to pay $132,374 in restitution.

Otto said Ary's expertise made him the logical choice to finish up the work
he had started.

"This museum has no problem with Max Ary," Otto said.

Omniplex board president James Farris agreed, but board member Butch Freeman
said he didn't know Ary was being paid as a museum consultant.

"On the surface, it sounds a little concerning," said Freeman, the Oklahoma
County treasurer. "Certainly from an appearance standpoint I can see where
there would be a cause for concern."

Otto declined to reveal how much Ary has been paid as a consultant.

Otto said museums often employ consultants when their specific expertise is
needed. Other experts may be tapped as the Omniplex is renovated over the
next decade, he said.

"That's the way the system works," Otto said. "A lot of people in the museum
business moonlight, if you will."

Jim Remar, senior vice president for the Kansas Cosmosphere, acknowledged it
is fairly common for museums to hire consultants for some tasks.

He declined to comment on Ary.

Police investigating a bank heist ring have recovered an antique piece of
jewelry that was made for Queen Elisabeth of Austria, better known as
Empress Sisi, the Winnipeg Police Service said Friday.
The Koechert Diamond Pearl or Star of Empress Sisi (or Sissi) was found in a
house in Winnipeg during a raid at the cusp of a two-year investigation of a
string of bank break-ins across Canada, police said in a statement.

It was stolen by a "highly sophisticated thief" in June 1998 from an alarmed
and secure glass display on exhibition at Castle Schonbrunn in Vienna,
Austria, police said.

The exhibit had marked the centennial anniversary of Empress Sisi's
assassination.

The wife of Emperor Franz Joseph I, Sisi (1837-1898) was renowned for her
tragic life, her beauty and ankle-length hair, a strict diet and exercise
regime to maintain her 20-inch (50-centimeter) waistline, as well as a
series of reputed lovers.

She was stabbed in the heart in at age 61 by a young anarchist in Geneva,
and her last words were reportedly: "What happened to me?"

Police have charged Gerald Blanchard with possession of the stolen gem, as
well as seven alleged accomplices, including an 83-year-old Vancouver man,
with a total of 101 charges of fraud, conspiracy, forging credit cards and
theft.

Constable Jacqueline Chaput of the Winnipeg Police Service told AFP the Star
of Empress Sisi would eventually be returned to Austria.
