Sorry if this is a repeat, I haven't seen my latest reply in a couple
hours here:

I replaced the commented code with the following:

#    if ($OK2INSERT) {
#        $dbh = DBI->connect("DBI:SQLite:dbname=C:/Lanosrep/beW/Perl/
HelpPage/area.db", "", "", {'RaiseError' => 1});
#        print "<br/>Inserting into Database , @values.";
#        $dbh->do("INSERT INTO area_status (areaID, survey_date,
update_time, status ) VALUES ('$values[0]', '$values[1]',
'$values[2]', '$values[3]')");
#        $dbh->disconnect();
#    }
    if ($OK2INSERT) {
        $dbh = DBI->connect("DBI:SQLite:dbname=C:/Lanosrep/beW/Perl/
HelpPage/area.db", "", "", {'RaiseError' => 1});
        print "<br/>Inserting into Database , @values.";
        $dbh->prepare('INSERT INTO area_status (areaID, survey_date,
update_time, status ) VALUES (?,?,?,?)');
        $dbh->execute('$values[0]', '$values[1]', '$values[2]',
'$values[3]');
        $dbh->disconnect();
    }

And I get this error:

Can't locate object method "execute" via package "DBI::db" at
test_script.pl
	line 182 (#1)
    (F) You called a method correctly, and it correctly indicated a
package
    functioning as a class, but that package doesn't define that
particular
    method, nor does any of its base classes.  See perlobj.

Uncaught exception from user code:
	Can't locate object method "execute" via package "DBI::db" at
test_script.pl line 182.
 at test_script.pl line 182

I would think I would have this available just by using DBI???
