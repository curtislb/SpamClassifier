Hello,
    I would like to formally state that I disapprove of this removal.  It is 
only thanks to Speakup being included in the default kernel that we are able 
to perform unassisted installations of Gentoo at all.  This seems as if it 
would be a great step backwards.
    Might I suggest that we attempt to contact the Speakup mailing list and 
developers for information on this issue?
Thank you,
Zachary Kline.
