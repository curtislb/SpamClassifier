Thanks!  Applied in r18461, r18462, r18465, r18466, r18467, r18468, and 
r18469.

A comment: this patch was in essence three patches (the pod, a test and 
a patch of the headers), next time could you separate them into three 
patches?  The test was itself actually a new file, so it could have 
just been attached rather than a patch made of it.  Also, when you add 
a new file, could you also update MANIFEST as well?  These are meant as 
positive critisms; you've done great work and your help is greatly 
appreciated.

Thanks again,

Paul
