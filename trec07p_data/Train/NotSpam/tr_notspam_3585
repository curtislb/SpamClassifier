TONIGHT ON SHOWBIZ TONIGHT- CNN HEADLINE PRIME 11pm ET/ 11pm PT


BALDWIN'S RAGE!
Alec Baldwin's raging phone call to his 11-year old daughter,
caught on tape! Why did he call her "a rude, thoughtless little
pig" and say "You don't have the brains or the decency as a
human being." Should Baldwin lose the right to see his
daughter? How did the tape get out? The explosive story on TV's
most provocative entertainment news show.

PLASTIC SURGERY SECRETS
What is the real story behind stars and plastic surgery? Who is
getting their bodies overhauled? And why are they doing it? The
intimate details from the Hollywood surgeon who actually does
the procedures in the interview you will see only on Showbiz
Tonight!

ANNA NICOLE BABY CUSTODY BATTLE
Larry Birkhead, Howard K. Stern, and Anna Nicole Smith's
daughter head back into a Bahamian courtroom. Will Birkhead,
who is the real father, finally get to take baby Dannielynn
home with him? Or will Anna Nicole's mother keep on fighting
him? Showbiz Tonight is all over the latest developments.


ON SHOWBIZ TONIGHT THIS WEEKEND:
SATURDAY- Stars and depression. Why are so many celebrities now
speaking so openly about their battles with depression? How the
stars are coping and what we can learn from their struggles.
SUNDAY-What happens when addictions tear apart Hollywood
marriages. Why do some marriages fall apart while others manage
to survive ? The secrets of the stars who manage to make it
work.

SHOWBIZ TONIGHT QUESTION OF THE DAY:
Alec Baldwin's Phone Tirade:Should he be denied visitation
rights with his daughter?
