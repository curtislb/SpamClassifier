Ok, I know that this is probably solved, butI just want to say this.
When it comes to audio mixer programs, just two words: 

nuke amixer.

The reason I say this is that aumix works much better and is easier to
install and get working.  

It seems that both alsamixer and amixer are nightmares to work with
speech, so I just use what I was used to on another system, and I see
that it works here.  



Hope this helps.
