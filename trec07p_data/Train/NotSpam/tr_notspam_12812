Scott,

It is already running. Look in the /etc/cron.daily directory, and you
should see a yum* script. 
Basically, it is checking for updates by default. That is to say, as
long as you haven't stopped the automatic starting of yum in chkconfig. 
Do a 
ps -e |grep yum  
to confirm that yum is running, and that is all you need to do.
If you want yum to clean up on a scheduled bases, then schedule a yum
clean all or whatever level of clean you are needing.
