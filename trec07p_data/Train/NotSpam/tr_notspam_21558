7:25 AM, 6/22/07, Update: Astronauts gear up for entry=20

The Atlantis astronauts are readying their spaceship for a weather-delayed =
landing today in either Florida or California. An overnight forecast contin=
ues to predict a chance of thunderstorms within 30 nautical miles of the Ke=
nnedy Space Center that could cause problems. But the forecast for the firs=
t two of three opportunities at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., calls for w=
indy but acceptable conditions. The winds are expected to build up as the d=
ay wears on, and forecasters believe the third and final California landing=
 opportunity will be out of limits. The shuttle has enough supplies to stay=
 in orbit until Sunday in a worst-case scenario.

The Spaceflight Meteorology Group at the Johnson Space Center in Houston pl=
ans to brief entry flight director Norm Knight around 9 a.m. An updated for=
ecast will be posted here as soon as it is available. In the meantime, here=
 is an updated list of all the day's landing opportunities (in EDT and miss=
ion elapsed time):
