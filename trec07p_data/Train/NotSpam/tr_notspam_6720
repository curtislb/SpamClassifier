Featuring Lutts' Logic:

The Master Of The Reality Distortion Field

No More Commercials In My Living Room

Today I want to write about three companies that changed my life and
reflect on what investment opportunities those companies provided . . . or
didn't.  It's human nature to assume that a company that makes a great
product will be a good investment, but that's often not the case.  So
let's kick it off with Apple.

My first encounter with Apple came back in 1986 - 21 years ago! - when I
joined Cabot and we were looking to replace the old paper-based subscriber
tracking system with an electronic database.   The best system I could
find, MacSub, was designed to run on a Macintosh computer, so I bought a
Mac.  And before long, we were using Microsoft Word to write on it,
finding it more user-friendly than the old green-screen IBM
Displaywriter.

Then came Microsoft Excel, for spreadsheets, and Adobe PageMaker for
layout.  And before you know it, Macs were all over the office.

Over the years I attended most MacWorld shows in Boston, most MacWorlds in
New York, saw two keynote speeches by Steve Jobs, the master of the
reality distortion field (It was said that simple proximity to the man
could alter your thought waves), and attended the final few MacWorld shows
in Boston.

For the home, I bought Macs because I knew them from the office.  The kids
used them to write and illustrate school papers, and to play games, never
minding that there were more games for Windows machines.  And then came
the Internet, which changed everything.

In January 2001, Apple introduced iTunes.  I confess I had no idea where
iTunes would lead, but iTunes alone compelled me to spend many months
copying all the "good" songs from my CD collection into iTunes.

When the iPod came out that October, my wife bought one, and I copied all
my music onto it.  Today everyone in the family has an iPod.   
2001 also marked the opening of the first Apple Store, which proved a
fantastic marketing decision, as it enabled people to try the machines in
a no-pressure situation, and get help from the friendly people at the
Genius Bar.

Finally, in April 2003, Apple opened the iTunes store, providing the start
of the solution to illegal downloading of audio and video.  My first
purchases were a dozen recordings of Stardust, the Hoagy Carmichael tune,
by various artists, and I burned them all to one CD so I could listen to
them in the car.  To date, I've bought over 860 items - some TV shows and
short films but mostly songs - through the iTunes Store.

As a consumer, at both work and home I've benefited from Apple's products
immensely.  A world without Apple's products would be poorer indeed.  But
as an investor, I've seen the ups and downs of Apple's stock.  Oh, we've
had our share of successes with Apple; most recently the Cabot Market
Letter advised buying in September 2004, and sold ten months later for a
profit of 112%.  But overall, Apple has not been an easy stock to make
money in.

For example, Apple came public in December 1980 at $5, and that's where it
was in December 1997, seventeen years later.  Over the years, the stock
has suffered losses of 73%, 83%, and 83%.  And more recently, the stock
performed no better than the market from the start of 1995 to the start of
2005.

On the other hand, it's brought advances of 990%, 1000% and - over the
past four years, 1,400%.  Stupendous!

Historically, the best way to invest in Apple has been to buy when both
the company and the stock market have been out of favor, and to sell when
both are in favor.  Today, however, there's a lot of love for Apple in the
world.  The company reported super first quarter results just last week;
revenues grew 21% (the slowest growth in 3 1/2 years) but earnings shot up
85% (the best gain in six quarters). Thanks to after-tax profit margins
that hit 14.6%, the best yet!

The stock gapped higher on the news, touching $100 for the first time, and
now we'll see if the stock can build on that.  Simple technical analysis
says it's likely.  On the other hand, sentiment is high, and I note that
since January 2006, Apple has only equaled the market's performance, and
thus this presents the possibility of a long RP (relative performance)
top.

Bottom line: color me a true-blue fan of the company's products but not a
big fan of the stock today.  In short, there are better-looking charts to
own in today's market.

Grow 50% or Pay Nothing!

When Intuitive Surgical represented the best growth story on Wall Street
in August 2004, we quickly named it Stock of the Month. Since then it's
handed investors 600% gains.

When we could see that Apple Computer's earnings momentum was shooting
through the roof in October 2004, we named it Stock of the Month. It was
selling for a shockingly low $35 per share. Today, (adjusted for a 2-for-1
split) it has turned a $10,000 investment into $43,000.

When the rest of Wall Street felt that Google's best days were behind in
July 2005, our research said the tear would continue. Six months after we
named it Stock of the Month, my readers saw the stock gain an incredible
$160 a share.

There are 16 more Stocks of the Month I could name that have handed us an
88% average profit per stock over the past two years...

Now on to a product that's far less well-known, and that, to date, has
offered no investment opportunity.  It's ReplayTV.  Call it the
alternative to TiVo that many people have never heard of.

Both TiVo and ReplayTV began selling their digital video recorder (DVR)
products in late 1999.  The promise?  Like a VCR, they would enable you to
"time-shift," to watch a recorded TV show whenever you wanted.  But
because they were based on hard drive technology, random access meant
there was no need to wind or rewind.   And storage capacity was enormous.

I bought a ReplayTV instead of a TiVo, in part because of the look and
feel of the interface, and in part because of ReplayTV's commercial-skip
feature.  Once a show was recorded you could automatically skip over the
commercials; with TiVo you could only fast-forward through the
commercials.

Since then, I only watch TV commercials during the Super Bowl . . . and
when I'm outside my own house . . . and I can't tell you how annoying
those commercials are when you're accustomed to not seeing them!

An investment in ReplayTV was almost possible, but it's a good thing it
wasn't.  TiVo went public in September 1999, peaked at 79 in January 2000,
and has never been even close to that level since.   
This year it's climbed from 5 to 6 1/2.  And TiVo has never had a
profitable year, despite the fact that was always better-marketed and
better-recognized than ReplayTV.  The problem?  Not enough buyers of a
technology that was just a little too complicated for most people.

ReplayTV planned to go public in March 2000, but a weak market for IPOs
(not to mention a big bad bear market) got in the way.  The IPO was
eventually withdrawn in August 2000.  And then the company was sued by
dozens of TV networks and studios over the commercial-skipping feature.

Nearing bankruptcy, ReplayTV was bought by SonicBlue in 2001.  Then in
2003(still fighting the lawsuits), SonicBlue filed for bankruptcy and was
sold to D&M Holdings, a Japanese company that includes Denon, Marantz,
McIntosh, Snell, Boston Acoustics, and Escient brands.   

Today D&M sells ReplayTV for the PC, software that puts the functions of a
VCR in your computer.

DVRs, meanwhile, are now available from your local cable provider.   
They're made by Motorola, Scientific Atlanta, and other major
manufacturers.  But they don't skip commercials.  (If you're a real geek,
however, you can find instructions online for hacking your TiVo so it
skips commercials, and I assume it's possible with other units as well.)

Eventually, my ReplayTV will die - all hard drives do - but I'm in no
hurry for that day to come.  In fact, when it comes, I may just replace
the hard drive!  Because I've arrived at the best part of the story.  When
I originally bought my ReplayTV, I had a choice of payment plans - pay a
monthly fee or a one-time lifetime fee.

I paid the lifetime fee - I believe it was $250 - and haven't paid a penny
since.  Over 7 1/2 years, that's just $33 a year . . . and falling.  And
the machine still works, dialing faithfully into the network now
maintained by D&M Holdings.  In the end, the machine has proved a far
better investment than the stock would have been.

The third company that's changed my life is XM Satellite Radio, the
company that offers pay-for-service radio, with 73 different music
channels, 39 channels of news, talk, sports and entertainment, 21 regional
traffic channels and 23 play-by-play sports channels.

The other company in the industry is Sirius, which offers a similar full
slate of programming.  XM's service was launched in September 2001, while
Sirius started in July 2002.  I think both are wonderful.

I became a subscriber of XM somewhere in 2002, when a radio came out that
fit my car aesthetically.  And since then, I don't listen to commercials
or other blather in my car. Instead, I listen to a wide variety of music. 
When I hear a new song I like, I push a button that records the name of
the artist and song and from time to time I go to the iTunes store and buy
those songs.  Life is good.

But as an investment, neither XM nor Sirius has brought riches to its
investors, and the simple reason is that both companies have spent too
much money.

They've got plenty of customers.  At the end of 2006, Sirius had 6 million
paying subscribers, while XM had 7.6 million.  And revenues?   
XM brought in $933 million last year, while Sirius brought in $637.   
But neither company has ever turned a profit!  And now they want to merge
- which raises issues of a possible monopoly - but that's a subject for
another day.

So could you have made money in XM?  Actually, we did.  The Cabot Market
Letter recommended XM in March 2003, at the start of a great bull market
and sold thirteen months later for a profit of 388%.

The stock also appeared in Cabot Top Ten in July, November and December of
2003, and buying at any one of those dates could have worked out very
well, but XM was not a stock to buy and hold and neither was Sirius.  Like
most companies that have trouble turning revenues into profit, the stocks
began lagging badly.  This year, for example, XM began the year at 15 and
is now 12.  Sirius began the year at 3 1/2 and is now at 3.

Bottom line: It takes more than good products to make a good investment. 
It helps if management can convert revenues into earnings!  But even if
they can't you can still find profitable investment opportunities in
stocks that change people's lives; just don't get stuck holding the stocks
too long!

Final words.  This morning at 7:15 a truck hit a utility pole in our
neighborhood, knocking out power to a portion of the city for 3 1/4 hours.
 So we got off to a slow start in the office today.  But we feel lucky
compared to those folks in California who lost their freeway!
