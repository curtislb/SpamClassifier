Lou Dobbs Tonight
Thursday, May 31, 2007

Tonight, following the third deadliest month in the entire Iraq
war, the number two commander in Iraq warned today he may not
be ready by the September to say whether the troop buildup is
working. The remarks come at a time when U.S. military
commanders are talking with Iraqi militants about potential
cease-fires.

Visit http://cnn.com/loudobbstonight to read Lou’s
latest commentary on how the left wing and the right wing of
this nation’s media are hell-bent on attacking him personally,
and why he won’t back down.

Tonight, we’ll take a hard look at the 1986 amnesty debate to
see what lessons Congress has and has not learned in the past
21 years.

And a group of Georgia citizens holding a rally today – they’re
opposed to the Senate’s illegal alien amnesty legislation. The
group wants to send a strong message to Georgia Senators Saxby
Chambliss and Johnny Isakson to vote against the bill.
Congressmen across the country, returning to their home
districts for recess, are catching an earful from their
constituents, pressuring them to oppose any plan to grant
amnesty to the millions of illegal aliens living in America.
We’ll have that report tonight.

U.S.-Russian relations have reached a low point recently, so
much so that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Bush are
planning meetings in early July to resolve relations. Today,
Putin defended Russia’s test firing of new ballistic missiles
saying it was in response to the U.S. initiating a new arms
race. We’ll bring you the latest tonight.

There is a declining rate of inspections on the seafood and
shellfish imported to the United States. As imports of seafood
climb in America, U.S. test inspections fell to 0.59 percent in
2006. Currently, the U.S. imports more than 80 percent of its
seafood, most of it coming from industrial fish farms in Asia
and Latin America. Are we in danger? We’ll tell you tonight.

Visit http://cnn.com/loudobbstonight for more on
tonight’s show.

Lou Dobbs lays out his manifesto to save the middle class in
his new book, “War on the Middle Class: How the Government, Big
Business, and Special Interest Groups Are Waging War on the
American Dream and How to Fight Back.” War on the Middle Class
is now on sale in bookstores near you and on Amazon.com and
BarnesandNoble.com.
