When a session setup request is sent as an anonymous user (NUL user),
should/could there be
password associated with that?
Right now, sec=none option, will prompt you for a password.
And when we add code to retry session setup as anonymous user if the first
session setup request
fails, should that retry request be sent with the password or without
password?

When smbfs sends requests as an anonymous user, it does not send a password
along with it.
