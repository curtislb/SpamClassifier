June 20, 2007

Rep. Waxman and 34 colleagues urge the U.S. Trade Representative to
reexamine the Administration's decision to put Thailand on a “Priority
Watch List” because of steps taken by the Thai government to secure
generic versions of three drugs for citizens in its public health
program. In the letter, the members call on the USTR to affirm the
rights of countries to use the public health flexibilities recognized in
international trade law.
