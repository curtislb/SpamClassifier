That's true, as an ideal.  In reality, you can't expect every DD or even
maintainer to subscribe to -legal except when they've got a particular
problem to discuss.  In this case it's a pity when you finally get the
impression that what you are told there neither matches the opinion of
the majority of your colleagues, nor of the ftpmasters - but the
ftpmasters' opinion is more insteresting for you in that case.

Definitely - if the NM process works as it should, at least every DD who
entered since it's been established should have a working understanding
of licensing, and that should be enough to *start* a discussion.  

I'm not sure, however, that this is the general attitude on -legal: I've
never encountered it.  Instead, I had the feeling that it was in
particular directed at you, since you seemed to claim to have better
understanding of the legal situation than your counterpart, and use that
as an argument for your position: In which case I can well understand
that the counterpart argues against this "better understanding".

I don't expect that you engage in all those discussions.  But I remember
several cases where ftpmasters were mentioned on -legal, either in a
phrase like "finally, you'd have to ask the ftpmasters", or in
complaints like "the ftpmasters appear to have a different opinion, but
we don't know why".  In these cases, it would be really helpful if one
of you could step up and take part in the discussion.

And a mail like
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=350624;msg=142;att=0
is not only not-helpful-at-all, it's really discouraging to see a
discussion ending like this.  Well, in that particular case I'd
understand if you don't answer to the bug, but the reasoning could be
published elsewhere where Mr. $greps_for_his_name_on_debian_lists cannot
answer easily.

Regards, Frank
