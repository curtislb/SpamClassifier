Hi all

I apologize if the issue has already been tackled in this list. It was
raised by Norbert Bollow in
https://your.trash.net/pipermail/siug-discuss/2007-June/003793.html .

I.e. the code you get for a "general" license (without registering the
work) puts the "dc" metadata about the type of license in a <span>
element, which the W3C code validator http://validator.w3.org/ doesn't
accept. Whereas if you register a work under a license, the metadata
(which also include author, right holder, title, description ecc) are
in a <rdf:RDF> element, which the W3C code validator accepts.

Sure, one goal  is that search engines should be able to read the
metadata, and they obviously can with the <span> solution too. But why
the difference? Why doesn't the code for a "general" license put the
metadata in a <rdf:RDF> element too, if this what the W3C standards
apparently require?

It's not just a matter of being able to put a
http://www.w3.org/Icons/valid-xhtml10 button on a site - but valid
code makes general access possible.
