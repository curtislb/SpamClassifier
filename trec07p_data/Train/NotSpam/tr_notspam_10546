This is the email that appeared on the Samba-Technical mailing list 
(samba-technical@lists.samba.org) on March 30.

You can find more information regarding Linux at the following URLs:
	http://www.opensuse.org
	http://www.ubuntu.org

Both URLs provide a download facility. To install Linux in place of your 
current MS Windows operating system you would need to download one of the ISO 
images, then burn it to an optical disk (CD-R or DVD-R) to enable you to 
install it. If you would rather just test-drive Linux before choosing to 
install it please let me know - I will burn a live-cd for you and then send 
it to you.

Please let me know if I can assist you in any way.

It was a pleasure to meet you over the phone.

Cheers,
John T.
