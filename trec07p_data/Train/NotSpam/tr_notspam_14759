Hello list, I am not sure if this has all ready been discussed, so 
forgive me if it has. I am wanting to play around with the cd based 
firewall, devil-linux and am wondering what it would take, and, how 
hard it would be to have speakup support for it. I have asked on the 
dl mailing list about doing a headless install, so I wont have to 
worrie with speakup, but, don't seem that many people know if a 
headless install can be done. If anyone has ever done anything with 
it and has any ideas, that would be great. I figured that google 
would know, but, I did not find much there either.
Thanks.
