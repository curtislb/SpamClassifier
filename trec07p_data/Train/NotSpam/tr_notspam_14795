So, does that mean that speakup comes as part of the kernel of 
devil-linux? I know nothing about compiling kernels or even the 
complexities of how all of it works, but, as I said, I just wanted to 
play around with it. I have used speakup along with a doubletalk lt 
on debian and did not have any problems throughout the install, so, 
will it be that easy with dl? Can I just put in the cd, type the 
normal speakup_synth=ltlk thing and get speach? If I could use 
speakup to get it going, that would certainly be better than 
headless, but, I did not think that you could get devil-linux with 
speakup support. I did read that it could be headless after the 
install but was hoping that I could somehow have speech before that 
point, to get it going at least. I did join the mailing list and 
asked the same question there, and have gotten several different 
answers, from, yes, you  can have a headless installation, to, no you 
can't, to, you can only have a headless devil-linux box after you 
install it. I am quite new at this and may even get myself into 
something I was not looking for, but, figured it was worth a try. Any 
more help or ideas on how to get this crazy thing going would be wonderful.
Thanks for getting back.
Jeremy
