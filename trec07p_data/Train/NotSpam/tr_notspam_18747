Italian Police Recover Ancient Temple
 
By ARIEL DAVID
Associated Press Writer

June 12, 2007, 12:14 PM EDT

ROME -- Italian police have recovered an ancient Greek temple dug up in
southern Italy by a construction crew who had dumped or looted the prized
artifacts and begun to pour cement over the ruins, authorities said Tuesday.

After receiving information about the discovery during construction work on
a tourist resort on the coast of southern Calabria, police used helicopters
to locate the site near the town of Crotone, said art squad officials from
the Carabinieri paramilitary police.

More than 50 artifacts, including columns and mosaics, had been excavated
from the site and used to decorate another hotel complex nearby, while other
pieces had been placed in a dump to be reused as construction material.

When police located the site last week, workers were preparing to lay the
foundations of the resort hotel on the remaining ruins, said Gen. Giovanni
Nistri, the head of the art squad.

"It would have been the final tombstone for this temple," Nistri told a news
conference in Rome.

Police identified two suspects for possible prosecution for failing to alert
authorities about the find, damaging the site and for illegal possession of
archaeological artifacts, Nistri said. The two were not arrested.

Italy is full of archaeological treasures -- many undiscovered -- and
developers are required to report any finds. Countless public and private
works have been scrapped or delayed over the years as state archaeologists
descended on building sites, and it is not uncommon for developers to fail
to report a discovery and plow through ancient treasures.

In Rome, plans to build a third subway line have been delayed for decades,
and in 1999, the construction of a parking garage caused outrage after
workers sliced through a Roman villa during hurried preparations for the
Holy Year celebrations and mosaics and ceramics from the ruins turned up in
a garbage dump on Rome's outskirts.

The discovery of the Greek temple is of "extraordinary historic and artistic
value" and experts believe it may be part of a larger ancient settlement,
the Carabinieri said in a statement.

The ruins are "one big puzzle" for scholars, as the area was previously
thought to be devoid of such important public buildings, said archaeological
superintendent Giovanni Guzzo.

The temple mixes two styles of Greek architecture, combining the austere
Doric with the more graceful decorations of Ionic. It was probably built
between the fourth and third centuries B.C. by the Bruzii, an Italic
population that lived under Hellenistic influence, which at the time
extended across southern Italy, Guzzo said.

He said that over the next months archaeologists will work to enlarge the
165-by-65-foot dig. They will also try to reconstruct how the original
temple must have looked by piecing together the remains scattered and
damaged by the developers.

First horse falls to vandals 
By JIM KINNEY, The Saratogian

Email to a friendPost a CommentPrinter-friendly
SARATOGA SPRINGS - "Giddy Up" is down for the count - for now.

The mirrored mosaic horse sculpture that was in front of Bonacio
Construction Co.'s offices on Excelsior and East avenues fell victim to
vandals Friday night, said Joel Reed, executive director of the Saratoga
County Arts Council.
He said it was tipped over and broken, but whoever did the damage left the
rest behind. Bonacio's employees are repairing it, and the artists who
created it - Dana Rudolph and Ronda Jeffer - are going to touch it up
cosmetically. He expected "Giddy Up" would be back on display sometime next
week. 
Giddy Up is one of 34 uniquely decorated horses featured in "Horses:
Saratoga Style," a public art event sponsored by the Arts Council and area
business groups.
Giddy Up's sudden disappearance had passersby and fans thinking it's been
stolen. Reed said he didn't announce the vandalism so as not to encourage
copycats.
"When we first started talking about this months ago, people were talking
about the vandalism that happened last time," he said, referring the first
"Horses: 
Saratoga Style" project in 2002.
In 2002, a Skidmore College student was arrested after passersby saw him
hauling half of a horse sculpture down Broadway to his apartment. Three
Amsterdam-area residents also pleaded guilty to taking another sculpture and
dumping it in the Schoharie Creek along the New York state Thruway.
That horse, "La Petite Fleur," was missing for weeks before kayakers found
it floating in the Schoharie.
"It seems like all the publicity - 'help us look out for these sculptures' -
didn't help us much last time," Reed said.

Museum robbed of historical data 
 
Tuesday June 12 2007
 
by Afeefah Beharry


Bandits made off with tons of historical and research material which were
stored on jump drives when they broke into the Museum of Antigua & Barbuda
sometime between Sunday evening and early yesterday morning.

The burglars also reportedly stole a number of items from the Museum gift
shop.

Executive Director of the Historical Society Michele Henry told the Antigua
Sun it appeared as though the bandits broke into the building between 10
p.m. Sunday and 7 a.m. yesterday. 

She said the staff noticed the break in about 7:30 a.m. when they turned up
for duties.

"This is a heavy blow to the society and the people of Antigua & Barbuda,"
she said.

She said the thieves broke the windows to gain entry to the building and
damaged three artefact doors which would be very costly to repair as the
materials are not available today.

The bandits reportedly took five jump drives, miniaturised electronic
storage devices, containing important research project material which Henry
said she was working on to submit to a regional agency for funding.

Besides that, Henry said that they made off with over $1,000 worth in
reproduction of historical postcards. Maps of Antigua & Barbuda and handmade
jewellery were also stolen. 

"It appears as though these people are petty thieves," Henry said.

She told this newspaper that she was in the process of reviewing the
security system of the museum with a team from the Public Works Department.

Henry added that the museum, one of the oldest non-profit organisations on
the island, does not have funding to employ security guards.

She said this was the first time something of that magnitude has happened to
the museum and she is appealing to individuals who are being approached to
purchase used jump drives to report it to the police who are investigating
the matter.

Pour vol de pi?ces arch?ologiques du Tassili, cinq personnes condamn?es ?
une peine de 3 ? 20 ans de prison ferme 

La Tribune (Algiers) 
ACTUALIT?S
12 Juin 2007 
Publi? sur le web le 12 Juin 2007 

By Farida Belkhiri


Le tribunal criminel d'Illizi a condamn?, samedi dernier, cinq personnes
accus?es de vol et revente de pi?ces arch?ologiques ? des peines allant de 3
? 20 ans de prison ferme. Selon une source judiciaire, deux des accus?s ont
?t? condamn?s chacun ? trois ans de prison ferme et les trois autres ? sept,
dix et vingt ans de prison. 

Ils sont tous condamn?s pour ?constitution d'association de malfaiteurs, vol
qualifi?, escroquerie et tentative d'?coulement de pi?ces arch?ologiques du
patrimoine culturel du Tassili?, ajoute la source. 

Selon l'Office national du parc du Tassili (ONPT), partie civile dans cette
affaire, les pi?ces arch?ologiques, une centaine, avaient ?t? vol?es par ces
malfaiteurs au mois de janvier. Ces derniers avaient tent? de les exp?dier ?
l'?tranger. 

Au cours de ce m?me mois, rapporte le quotidien El Watan dans un article
paru le 25 avril dernier, des pi?ces arch?ologiques avaient disparu du mus?e
du Parc national du Tassili. 

64 pi?ces de grande valeur, des bifaces, des hachereaux, des nucl?us, des
p?doncul?s, des lames, des pointes de fl?che et des foliac?es, auraient ?t?
vol?es par des individus qui se sont introduits au mus?e par effraction.
?Rien qu'en janvier dernier, 250 objets de la m?me valeur ont ?t? r?cup?r?s
sur des touristes et remis pour expertise ? l'Office du parc national de
l'Ahaggar. Les douanes d'Illizi totalisent de 2003 ? 2006, un record de 1
401 pi?ces arch?ologiques saisies. Un trafic qui ne s'attaque pas uniquement
au mat?riel arch?ologique mais aussi ? la flore : 948 plantes prot?g?es ont
?t? retrouv?es dans les paquetages des touristes?, rapporte El Watan. Par
ailleurs, les douanes alg?riennes avaient annonc? la saisie, au mois de
d?cembre de l'ann?e derni?re, de pr?s d'une centaine de pi?ces
arch?ologiques, du Tassili pour la plus part, dissimul?es dans des bagages
de touristes. 

La brigade de Tamanrasset aurait saisi durant la m?me ann?e, lors de
contr?les effectu?s ? l'a?roport Aguenar, 2 300 pi?ces arch?ologiques sur
une cinquantaine de vols ? destination de l'?tranger. 

Enfin, rappelons l'affaire des cinq touristes allemands qui avaient vol? des
pi?ces arch?ologiques prot?g?es et condamn?s en janvier 2005 ? deux mois de
prison ferme par le tribunal de Djanet.

Thief Sails off with Museum's Whaling Artifacts, Sextant 
By Al Campbell | Published  Today | General News   
 
 
Thief Sails off with Museum's Whaling Artifacts, Sextant
SWAINTON - Six historic whaling implements, with a total value of $3,500
were stolen from the Cape May County Historical Museum some time between
June 2 at 2 p.m. and the morning of June 5.
According to Curator Pary Woehlcke, Middle Township police haven't gotten
any leads on the theft thus far.
"In 75 years, this is the second time someone has stolen whaling
implements," she said as she showed the whaling implement case, where the
vintage weapons were displayed.
According to Woehlcke, who spoke with former curator Somers Corson, a
similar incident occurred about 20 years ago when a burglar entered the barn
located behind the museum on Route 9, and took whaling implements.
The difference between then and now, someone in the nursing home, just east
of the barn, spotted that thief and alerted Middle Township police, who
caught the culprit with the stolen goods in his car on Stone Harbor
Boulevard.
No such luck this time.
Woehlcke said police continue to check various Internet auction sites, where
unsuspecting villains sometimes fence such stolen gear.
It's theorized the thugs knew what they wanted, leaving many other valuable
items untouched.
Among the most highly valued of the stolen items was a sailor's sextant in a
wooden case. It was removed from a glass display case without breaking the
glass.
Also stolen were:
* Toggle Iron, for use in a darting gun.
* Single fluted harpoon
* Bomb lance
* Darting gun with bomb lance.
* Darting gun without a bomb lance
* Sailor's sextant
* Sailor's palm thimble, used by Humphrey Cresse to mend canvas sails.
Woehlcke said that the stolen items were all marked with small white dot
stickers on which identifying numbers were written.
Those stickers had been on the items so long, she said it is likely that the
metal underneath would be somewhat brighter than the surrounding metal.
The harpoons were about 2.5 to 3 feet in length. The darting gun resembled a
shotgun, and was used to fire a lance with a charge on it, to kill the whale
quicker.
Those harpoons were "rather common," Woehlcke said, and others, quite
similar to them were untouched by the thief.
The barn's two doors, in which the whaling implements were exhibited, are
routinely left open when the museum is in operation.  Tours are then taken
through.
Since there is a door close to a driveway leading to the nursing home,
Woehlcke said it would have been possible for a thief to pull in there, take
the items, and exit without being seen.
"We think that whoever did it cased the collection and knew exactly what
they wanted," she said.
Anyone with information about the theft is asked to contact Middle Township
police at (609) 465-8700.

Contact Campbell at (609) 886-8600 ext 28 or e-mail: al.c@cmcherald.com

Dutch painting 'stolen from NSW gallery'
13th June 2007, 16:48 WST 

A painting by a Dutch master has reportedly been stolen from the Art Gallery
of NSW.

Neither the Art Gallery of NSW nor the NSW Police Force would confirm the
Channel Nine report of the theft.

"I don't have any comment," gallery spokeswoman Claire Martin said.

However, she said a joint press conference with police was scheduled for
Thursday morning.

In its one-line report, Channel Nine did not name the artwork nor the
painter.
