TONIGHT ON THE CBS EVENING NEWS
<http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/eveningnews/main3420.shtml>=20

Here is an early preview of what we are planning for tonight's CBS
EVENING NEWS from Anchor and Managing Editor, Katie Couric...=20

Hi, everyone,=20

Tens of thousands draped themselves in Iraqi flags and marched through
the streets of two Shiite holy cities today to mark the fourth
anniversary of Baghdad's fall to U.S. troops. The show of force was
orchestrated by the radical Shiite cleric Moqtada al Sadr, who proved
that he commands an enormous following among Iraq's largest religious
group. Martin Seemungal is in Baghdad, and will have more on this story
tonight.=20

Iran announced a dramatic expansion of uranium enrichment, saying it has
begun operating 3,000 centrifuges. That's nearly 10 times the previously
known number, and is in defiance of U.N. demands that it halt the
program or face increased sanctions. We will have a reality check on the
real threat from Iran.=20

President Bush is making another push for immigration reform. He visited
the U.S.-Mexico border to tout a guest worker program for immigrants.
With up to 12 million illegal immigrants in the U.S., lawmakers haven't
agreed on how to uphold the law without disrupting lives, eroding the
work force and risking political upheaval. Kelly Cobiella will report
from the desert stretch where Arizona and Mexico meet. Border agents
there say they are pelted with rocks and the victims of assault from
smugglers. In fact, there have been more assaults against agents in the
Yuma sector this year than all of last year.=20

At any one time in this country, as many as 100,000 people are suffering
from heart failure, but only about 2,000 people a year receive heart
transplants. For a long time, doctors were focused on developing a heart
pump as a bridge to when a new heart becomes available. But a new device
is showing it can be more than just a bridge. Our contributing medical
correspondent, CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta, will tell you about this.=20

There's also a growing uproar over radio host Don Imus' racially charged
comments about the Rutgers University women's basketball team. Despite
his on-air apologies, the calls continue for him to be fired from his
syndicated morning program, after his racially charged comments. Imus
appeared on the Rev. Al Sharpton's radio program today and issued
another apology. Richard Schlesinger will have this report, and will
discuss the FCC's regulations as well.=20

Finally, for computer researcher Zombie Bell even his morning walk to
work is part of a grand experiment in digitizing and remembering
everything. The little camera around his neck takes a picture every 30
seconds or so, and a sound recorder rolls non-stop. Bell is saving his
whole life on computer, from childhood certificates to all his medical
records. John Blackstone will have his story.=20

I hope to see you tonight. Katie=20

TUESDAY MORNING ON THE EARLY SHOW
<http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/earlyshow/main500202.shtml>=20

Harry Smith, Hannah Storm, Julie Chen, and Russ Mitchell anchor THE
EARLY SHOW from New York. Dave Price will bring us the weather.=20

Along with the top news of the day, we will also have the following
stories:=20

ANNA NICOLE'S SISTER: NEW BOOK, PT. 1: In the first of an exclusive
two-part interview, Donna Hogan, sister of Anna Nicole Smith, will join
us to talk about the death of the blonde bombshell. Tuesday morning, in
her first interview since her sister's death, Hogan will join us to
discuss her unauthorized biography of the late actress entitled, Train
Wreck: The Life and Death of Anna Nicole Smith.=20

LOU DOBBS: In the first of his new weekly commentaries, Lou Dobbs,
anchor and managing editor of CNN's Lou Dobbs Tonight, will join us.=20

TWO HEROES who have made a difference: In another installment of our
special series, Second Act, we will take a look at Jim Laws, a
cardiologist from Ohio, and Ed Artis, who began his career as a juvenile
car thief. Ed soon found himself in the Army, where he learned to get
things done in hostile places. It was not long after that he began his
life as a freelance humanitarian. When Ed met Jim in Moscow in 1993, the
two knew they were destined for great things. In Moscow, Ed became a
Knight of Malta, a humanitarian order that dates back to the Crusades.
Jim, already a Knight for his Community Service, became intrigued by
Ed's courage. The two formed Knightsbridge and raise money like any
charity, but their ability to distribute large quantities of aid and
medicine directly to the people at the end of the line is what sets them
apart. Ed Artis and Jim Laws have risked their lives distributing tens
of millions of dollars worth of aid to the needy, and they couldn't be
happier. We'll hear their amazing story Tuesday morning.=20

soon teaming up with A-listers like Will Smith in I, Robot and Keanu

rising star will join us Tuesday morning to talk about his new film and
newfound success.=20
