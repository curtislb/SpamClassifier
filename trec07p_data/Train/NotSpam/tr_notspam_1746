That's certainly true. My concern is simply that a defendant in
a situation like this will present the copyright license as
granting him the right to do what the trademark license does
not allow. 

Basically, he'll argue that the copyright license should be read
to include "you can use the mark even to disparage us or to 
create a false association". I know it doesn't actually *say*
that in the license, but it also doesn't *not say* that.

Why give someone an argument, even a tenous one, when you can add
wording that takes away the entire argument?
