Cairo also has full transparency support, both for png and pdf.

Ulrik, I presume the problem you ran into was the absence of the cairo 
library dependency:

configure: error: Cannot find cairo.h! Please install cairo 
(http://www.cairographics.org/) and/or set CAIRO_CFLAGS/LIBS 
correspondingly.

which has it's own library dependencies as well. Most all Linux 
distributions (I'm presuming you're running Linux) have ways to install 
these dependencies easily: apt-get, rpm, etc.

Otherwise, if you had other problems installing Cairo, please let me 
know and I can fix them.

Jeff
