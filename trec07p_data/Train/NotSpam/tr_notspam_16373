You need to track the SessionSetupAndX calls for that tcp connection
to find the mapping between a username and a uid.
This may require that you can also decrypt kerberos.

You need to track the TreeConnectAndX calls for that tcp connection
and uid to find the mapping between a tid and a sharename.

Maybe the client never issued those commands?
Those two commands are very old and obsolete   so do not be surprised
if a modern windows client never issues them.
