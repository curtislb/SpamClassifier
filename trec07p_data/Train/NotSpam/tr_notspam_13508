Thank you all for your replies.... they have been more useful... well
in my case I have chosen to do some parametric tests (more precisely
correlation and linear regressions among some variables)... so it
would be nice if I had an extra bit of support on my decisions... If I
understood well from all your replies... I shouldn't pay soooo much
attntion on the normality tests, so it wouldn't matter which one/ones
I use to report... but rather focus on issues such as the power of the
test...

Thanks again.
