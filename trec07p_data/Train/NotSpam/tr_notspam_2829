TONIGHT ON SHOWBIZ TONIGHT - CNN HEADLINE PRIME 11pm ET/PT

VIRIGINA TECH MASSACRE: THE MEDIA FOCUS ON THE GUNMAN
Is there a danger that the chilling details about the horrific
killings could inspire copycats? Should we be concerned? Plus,
a revealing one-on-one interview with Craig Scott. He was
thrust into the media spotlight after his sister Rachel was
killed during the 1999 Columbine High School shootings. Why he
insists violent images in entertainment contribute to the
plague of violence in America.	

DADDY AND DANNIELYNN: FIRST PICTURES!
Tonight, the very first pictures of Larry Birkhead with the
baby he had with Anna Nicole Smith!
The inside story of how Larry is doing as a daddy. Will his
custody battle with Anna Nicole's mother get ugly? And, what
does Larry really think about Howard K. Stern?

THE SECRET LIFE OF SURI & OUR OBSESSION WITH STAR BABIES
It's “Happy Birthday Suri” as Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes’ baby
turns one! But what do we really know about her life with her
famous mom and dad? The revealing story, as we also ask: Why in
the world are we so obsessed with celebrity babies?

SHOWBIZ WEIGHT WATCH: “FRIENDS” STAR POSES NUDE!
Former “Friends” star Aisha Tyler (remember, she was Ross’s
hot-dinosaur-researching girlfriend?) takes it all off for the
new issue of Glamour, and makes a powerful statement about
weight and body image. She’s here in the interview you’ll see
only on Showbiz Tonight
