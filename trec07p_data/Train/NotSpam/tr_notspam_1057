Dear David,

on a first glance, this case looks very much similar to the
(in)famous Scientology v xs4all case in the Netherlands.

I'm a bit afraid of giving an advice without more thought on the
matter - including understanding what would be the applicable
law here - but I suggest checking whether provisions on "fair
use", "fair dealing", "exceptions/limitations" and/or "free usages"
(depending, again, on what is the applicable law) would not be
a valid defense here.

In particular, infringement of exclusive rights granted by
copyright/droit d'auteur law for the purposes of criticism/discussion 
is in principle admissible in various jurisdictions.  

Whether it is also admissible  also in practice depends on a range 
of conditions, again depending on the particular law to be applied.
Only judicial power can decide that.

I would suggest to check whether such exceptions might possibly apply 
before taking any other decision.

P.S.: nothing in the above excludes liability under other laws
      (e.g. libel).

Ciao,

Andrea
