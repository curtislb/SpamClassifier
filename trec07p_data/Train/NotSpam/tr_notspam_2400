May I suggest the Exam data from the mlmRev package as an example.

If you wish to have a random effect for Sex by school you could write
the model as

lmer(test.result ~ homework + Sex + (Sex|school))

which gives correlated random effects for the overall achievement in
schools and the differential effect of Sex by school.  Alternatively
you could write

lmer(test.result ~ homework + Sex + (1|school) + (1|Sex:school))

which gives uncorrelated effects for the intercept by school and for
the effect of sex by school.
