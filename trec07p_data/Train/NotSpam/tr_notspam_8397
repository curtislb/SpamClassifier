On the definitional question, some texts do indeed consider multi-category 
logistic regression as a glm.  But the original definition by Nelder does 
not.  I've never seen polr considered to be a glm (but it way well have 
been done).

Adding random effects is a whole different ball game: you need to 
integrate over the random effects to find a likelihood.  That integration 
is tricky, and I am not sure we yet have reliable software for it in the 
binary ('dichotomous dependent variable') case: SAS's NLMIXED certainly is 
not reliable.  I've had students run real problems through a variety of 
software, and get quite different results.  (It is possible that the shape 
of the likelihood is a problem but it is not the only one.)

MCMC approaches to that integration are an alternative not mentioned 
below.

You need to combine all the binary comparisons to get the likelihood, and 
the models have parameters in common.
