   Yes, I believe this is a better phrasing.  If I want to define a
   new method or or override an existing method on a metaclass instance
   [a class], then how do I do that?

AFAICS, there isn't currently a good way to do that.  (Depending, of
course, on whether you think Jonathan's suggestion qualifies.  ;-)
Nor does PDD15 seem to cover this; it actually says very little about
metaclasses, beyond just the fact that they exist (and even then only
mentions class metaclasses).

   The particular instance I'm looking at is a C<Str> class for
   Perl 6, where I want the get_string vtable function for the
   C<Str> metaclass instance is different from get_string of 
   a C<Str> class object.

To me, the phrases "C<Str> metaclass instance" and "C<Str> class object"
sound like the same thing.  Did you mean "C<Str> object" in the second
case?  If so, then get_string on the class metaclass would just affect
the way the class stringifies, and not any of the instances, but I don't
get the point of that.  So I'm sure I must be misunderstanding you.  Do
you have an example?  Maybe the perl6 code you mention?
