In principle that is certainly true. A couple of comments,
though.

1. R's rich data structures are likely to be superfluous.
   Mostly, at the sanitisation stage, one is working with
   "flat" files (row & column). This straightforward format
   is often easier to handle using simple programs for the
   kind of basic filtering needed, rather then getting into
   the heavier programming constructs of R.

2. As follow-on and contrast at the same time, very often
   what should be a nice flat file with no rough edges is not.
   If there are variable numbers of fields per line, R will
   not handle it straightforwardly (you can force it in,
   but it's more elaborate). There are related issues as well.

a) If someone entering data into an Excel table lets their
   cursor wander outside the row/col range of the table,
   this can cause invisible entities to be planted in the
   extraneous cells. When saved as a CSV, this file then
   has variable numbers of fields per line, and possibly
   also extra lines with arbitrary blank fields.

   cat datafile.csv | awk 'BEGIN{FS=","}{n=NF;print n}'

   will give you the numbers of fields in each line.

   If you further pipe it into | sort -nu you will get
   the distinct field-numbers. If you know (by now) how many
   fields there should be (e.g. 10), then

   cat datafile.csv | awk 'BEGIN{FS=","} (NF != 10){print NR ", " NF}'

   will tell you which lines have the wrong number of fields,
   and how many fields they have. You can similarly count how
   many lines there are (e.g. pipe into wc -l).

b) Poeple sometimes randomly use a blank space or a "." in a
   cell to demote a missing value. Consistent use of either
   is OK: ",," in a CSV will be treated as "NA" by R. The use
   of "." can be more problematic. If for instance you try to
   read the following CSV into R as a dataframe:

   1,2,.,4
   2,.,4,5
   3,4,.,6

   the "." in cols 2 and 3 is treated as the character ".",
   with the result that something complicated happens to
   the typing of the items.

   typeeof(D[i,j]) is always integer. sum(D[1,1]=1, but
   sum(D[1,2]) gives a type-error, even though the entry
   is in fact 2. And so on , in various combinations.

   And (as.nmatrix(D)) is of course a matrix of characters.

   In fact, columns 2 and 3 of D are treated as factors!

   for(i in (1:3)){ for(j in (1:4)){ print( (D[i,j]))}}
   [1] 1
   [1] 2
   Levels: . 2 4
   [1] .
   Levels: . 4
   [1] 4
   [1] 2
   [1] .
   Levels: . 2 4
   [1] 4
   Levels: . 4
   [1] 5
   [1] 3
   [1] 4
   Levels: . 2 4
   [1] .
   Levels: . 4
   [1] 6

   This is getting altogether too complicated for the job
   one wants to do!

   And it gets worse when people mix ",," and ",.,"!

   On the other hand, a simple brush with awk (or sed in
   this case) can sort it once and for all, without waking
   the sleeping dogs in R.

I could go on. R undoubtedly has the power, but it can very
quickly get over-complicated for simple jobs.

Best wishes to all,
Ted.
