Hi there:  Just curious about grml and getting keyboard support in X.  
I've tried downloading gnome, which seemed to go well, and I was able 
to get gdm to beep indicating the login screen, but upon logging in got 
no indication that I'd logged in and cannot run anything by using the 
alt-f2 for example to type gdm  and once there hit ctrl-g to verify 
I've got a terminal open...  Any idea what I can do here?  X seems 
configured otherwise.  Any help welcome...
Thanks much!  looking farward to the new release with the spelling 
problem fixed whichever software synth they use...
Cheereo!
