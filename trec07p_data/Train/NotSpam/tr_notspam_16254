Correct.  * is not special in a double quoted string.  The only
character that always need to be backslashed in a double-quoted string
are:
$ (otherwise, it's the start of a scalar variable, array element, or
hash element)
@ (otherwise, it's the start of an array or slice)
\ (otherwise, it's the indication that the next character is to be
escaped)
Characters that *sometimes* need to be backslashed in a double quoted
string include:
" (if and only if you're actually using " as your string delimiter)
' (if it is both preceded by an interpolated variable, and followed by
word characters)
: (if it is both preceded by an interpolated variable, and followed by
a second :, and then word characters)
Whatever delimiter you're using if you use the qq{} operator.
