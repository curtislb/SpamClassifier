Serpentegena writes "A joint research project by scientists at Harvard
University and BBn Technologies may have [0]spawned a new breed of
Metronet. The wireless network, code-named CitySense, which will consist
of 100 streetlamp-mounted nodes by 2011, will draw power off the
Cambridge, Mass. public grid and be used at first for weather and
pollution monitoring. The intention is to also allow 'academic
researchers worldwide [...] to submit their own research programs to run
on the network.' Sounds remarkably similar to the beginning of the
ARPANET, except the network hosts will be running Linux."

a difference a couple of months of good press for Blu-ray makes: this

The finer details: 'To win the cash prizes for NASA's Regolith Challenge,
teams must demonstrate fully autonomous robots capable of collecting at
least 330 pounds (150 kilograms) of mock Moon dirt within 30 minutes.
Whichever robot moves the most regolith over the benchmark limit, while
still meeting contest specifications, wins, NASA said. But in order to
compete, lunar regolith excavators must weigh less than 88 pounds (40
kilograms) and run on less than 30 kilowatts of power, according to
contest rules.'"

been [1]heavily fined for posting a porn link in an adult discussion

said the court case raised several concerns. 'In this case, the court has
given a new direction to the public concerning the responsibility of
internet users,' he said. Mok added that he also believed the case could
damage the freedom of information on the internet. 'This man posted a
link on the internet which now becomes an act that constitutes the
breaking of law, and my question is whether a link is being regarded as
the 'obscene article,'' he said.'"

Thursday in Uruguay, as the 160 children of school number 24 in the
humble town of Cardal received their XO computers. The learning tools
came directly from the hands of president Tabar√© Vazquez. It has become a
matter of national pride that Uruguay is the first country to realize the
project's goal. The target is that by 2009, every school-age child in
Uruguay will have one, and an initial 15 million dollars have already
been allocated to the project. From the newspaper articles: 'The
happiness of having a PC in their hands, some of them for the first time,
had the kids in ecstasy, which didn't wait to turn on their computers,
introduce their personal information (required the first time they're
turned on), choose the screen colors, and start experimenting with them.
What initially made them more enthusiastic was the possibility of taking
photographs and filming each others with the included webcams.'" More

Yesterday in New York City Microsoft held an invite-only [0]preview of
the Halo 3 Beta, and passed out early Beta keys to a group of game
journalists. The result is a [1]barrage of coverage about this
most-anticipated title. Notable features beyond basic previews include
[2]Dan Hsu's take on the game, [3]Dean Takahashi's 'I got my butt kicked'
perspective, the San Jose Merc's [4]interview with Bungie Community Lead
Brian Jarrad, CVG's hosting of the [5]official Beta Movie, and Joystiq's
[6]interview with Frank O'Connor, Bungie's writing lead. From the 1up
preview: "It's unmistakably Halo gameplay, despite the rearranged
controls (which feel natural after 10 minutes), and all of the additions
fit perfectly into the multiplayer universe we've come to love. The
interface has been overhauled and is even easier to use, and you now have
such niceties as being able to change your control layout at any point on
any screen. While the visuals are rich and beautiful, it's the audio
that's really impressed us so far. The rumbling throttle of unleashing
dual SMGs makes them feel incredibly powerful, and the Spartan Laser
tearing past your head is as scary as you'd imagine. Audio cues are more
important than ever, and the better your sound system the more next-gen
this will feel." More coverage below.

raguirre writes "An article on Physorg.org reports that a newly found
start [0]may be as old as the universe itself. Recent studies have
concluded that the Big Bang occurred somewhere in the neighborhood of
13.7 Billion years ago. The star, a heavy-elements laden fossil labeled
HE 1523-0901 on charts was probably born right around the same time;
approximately 13.2 Billion years ago. 'Today, astronomer Anna Frebel of
the the University of Texas at Austin McDonald Observatory and her
colleagues have deduced the star's age based on the amounts of
radioactive elements it contains compared to certain other "anchor"
elements, specifically europium, osmium and iridium.'"
