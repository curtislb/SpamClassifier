Hello Debian Legal,

I stumbled upon a package, lft, and noticed that the distributed
packaged was somewhat of age.  I looked it up and found quite updated
source at the program developers webpage [1]. So I pondered over why
this is not included; maybe the package maintainer is just asleep.  Then
I found the license [2], and thought that might be the fault. Following
that I checked the license included in the ordinary Debian package,
distributed in main. I now noticed that they are alike, which prompted
this message.

I'm running Debian Etch and this is the output of dpkg -s lft:
Package: lft
Status: install ok installed
Priority: optional
Section: net
Installed-Size: 88
Maintainer: Vince Mulhollon <vlm@debian.org>
Architecture: i386
Version: 2.2-3
Depends: libc6 (>=3D 2.3.2.ds1-21), libpcap0.7
Description: layer-four traceroute
 lft sends various TCP SYN and FIN probes (differing from Van Jacobson's
 UDP-based method) utilizing the IP protocol "time to live" field and
 attempts to elicit an ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED response from each gateway
along
 the path to some host.
 lft also listens for various TCP and ICMP messages along the way to
assist
 network managers in ascertaining per-protocol heuristic routing
information
 and can optionally retrieve various information about the networks it
 traverses.
