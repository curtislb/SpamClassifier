I do not think that GPLv3 permits it.  The OpenSSL license has the
obnoxious advertising clause

 * 3. All advertising materials mentioning features or use of this software
 *    must display the following acknowledgement:
 *    "This product includes cryptographic software written by
 *     Eric Young (eay@cryptsoft.com)"
 *    The word 'cryptographic' can be left out if the rouines from the library
 *    being used are not cryptographic related :-).

The current draft of GPLv3 allows some additional provisions such as

  d. limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
  authors of the material; or

but nothing like the advertising clause.
