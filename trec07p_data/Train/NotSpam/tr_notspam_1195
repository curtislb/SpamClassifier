I think it's been a while since we had many failure free smokes.  Is 
there/does someone know of a better "smoking" module to make it easily 
to test failures and if it's architecture specific, or operating system 
specific, or both.  There's a few problems with freebsd on amd64 which 
may largely be configuration(freebsd is amd64, not x86_64).  
Portability on parrot is more than a problem of exported symbols at the 
moment.  I think we've become overly accustomed to having test 
failures, but some installer scripts won't install if there's a single 
failure, which may be something trivial.
