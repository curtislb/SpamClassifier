<B>TONIGHT ON SHOWBIZ TONIGHT - CNN HEADLINE PRIME 11pm
ET/PT</B>

<B> SYMPATHY FOR PARIS?!?!</B>
Should we feel sorry for Paris Hilton? Paris speaks out for the
first time since being locked up. But has she really changed or
is this just a big public relations stunt? And is she really in
psychological peril? The outrage and the debate on TV's most
provocative entertainment news show.

<B>LESSONS FOR PARIS: FROM THE GOOD GIRLS!</b>
Paris, pay attention! (You too Britney!) Tonight, Showbiz
Tonight reveals how the good girls of Hollywood can teach a

not – be doing. Uh, Lindsay, are you listening too?
