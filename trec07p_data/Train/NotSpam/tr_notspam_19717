11:43 PM, 6/15/07, Update: Astronauts wrap up successful spacewalk; retract=
 P6-2B array, complete heat shield repair; news briefing; combining earlier=
 takes=20

Enjoying an unexpected reversal of fortune, Russian cosmonauts carried out =
electronic bypass surgery today to resuscitate the international space stat=
ion's befuddled electronic brains while an Atlantis spacewalker successfull=
y stapled a wound in the shuttle's upper heat shield. Danny Olivas and fell=
ow spacewalker Jim Reilly then fluffed and pampered a huge set of solar bla=
nkets, coaxing them back into compact storage boxes and avoiding a host of =
feared problems. The work clears the way for a future crew to move the arra=
ys as required before delivery of European and Japanese research modules la=
te this year and early next.

All in all, it was a banner day for NASA and the Russian space agency, whic=
h just a few hours earlier were contemplating gloomy contingency plans to k=
eep a crippled space station alive after Atlantis' departure next week. Tak=
ing no chances, contingency planning continued while Russian engineers work=
ed to confirm the health of the computers. But there was a clear sense of r=
elief in U.S. space circles as the Russians reported initial success and th=
e astronauts wrapped up a by-the-book spacewalk.

"You guys did a great job," astronaut Megan McArthur radioed Reilly, Olivas=
 and their crewmates as they wound up a seven-hour 58-minute excursion. "It=
 was great watching you work, great job by the whole team."

The spacewalk, successful as it was, was overshadowed by concern about the =
station's on-again, off-again computers, machines that are critical to the =
safe operation of the international outpost.

Three computers make up the so-called terminal computer system, which opera=
tes the station's Russian rocket thrusters to re-orient the lab complex as =
required to keep sunlight on solar arrays and to keep sensitive systems fro=
m getting too hot or too cold.

The central computer, also made up of three redundant channels, or lanes, i=
s used to control the Russian segment's Elektron oxygen generator, its Vozd=
ukh carbon dioxide removal system and a variety of other critical systems. =
While both computers are triply redundant, the systems can safely operate t=
he station with a single channel in section.

Earlier this week, around the time the Atlantis astronauts were installing =
a new solar power truss, the terminal computer crashed. An automated reboot=
 procedure was then executed to shut down and restart all three terminal co=
mputer lanes and all three central computer channels. The reboot procedure =
didn't work, however, and engineers have been struggling ever since to rest=
ore the computer system to normal operation.

After two days of fruitless, around-the-clock troubleshooting, engineers di=
sconnected the computers from U.S. solar power early today on the theory so=
mething in the circuitry was producing "noise" or otherwise interfering wit=
h the operation of the German-built computers. The computers are equipped w=
ith power supplies that include protective low-voltage circuitry sensitive =
to such noise.

When commands were sent to activate the isolated computers, they failed to =
respond properly and engineers feared the worst - a subtle software bug or =
a hardware failure that at some point, in a worst-case scenario, could forc=
e the station crew to abandon ship.

The Russians ultimately determined that two computers - one terminal lane a=
nd one central lane - had suffered hardware failures in their secondary pow=
er supplies earlier in the week. So they asked station commander Fyodor Yur=
chikhin and flight engineer Oleg Kotov to bypass the suspect power supply c=
ircuitry in the other four computers.

"While Danny and J.R. were outside, our Russian colleagues were busy uplink=
ing a procedure to the crew in an attempt to bypass that sensitive circuit =
to see if we could prevent this constant rebooting that the computers were =
going through that wouldn't allow them to come up," said MIke Suffredini, m=
anager of the space station program at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.

"It was a very simple shunt, they removed a connector on the back of the co=
mputers and they inserted a simple shunt and the shunt allowed them to bypa=
ss this circuitry. They went to activate the four that they thought were st=
ill good and all four of the computers came up in the configuration that tr=
acked each other."

After the power supply bypass surgery, Russian flight controllers told thei=
r NASA counterparts lanes one and three were had been successfully re-power=
ed in the terminal computer, along with lanes two and three in the central =
computer. The systems then were shut down to close access panels and restar=
ted in self-test mode as planned. Controllers said they planned to operate =
the computers throughout the evening and to collect telemetry for additiona=
l analysis during passes over Russian ground sites early Saturday.

"They want to let the computers run for a while overnight to make sure they=
 remain stable and then tomorrow, if everything looks well and the data ind=
icates the computers are doing all right, then I would expect we would slow=
ly begin to activate the systems on board, including the attitude control s=
ystem," Suffredini said. "Our colleagues were very excited."

Today's spacewalk began at 1:24 p.m. when Reilly and Olivas switched their =
spacesuits to internal battery power. This was the 86th EVA devoted to stat=
ion assembly and maintenance since construction began in 1998, the ninth so=
 far this year, the third overall for the Atlantis crew and the second this=
 mission for Reilly and Olivas.=20

Olivas began the blanket repair work by using his helmet camera to beam dow=
n close-up views of the torn insulation and surrounding blankets to help fl=
ight controllers assess the health of the system. The damage site showed up=
 in sharp detail, with a 4-inch by 6-inch corner peeled back from an adjace=
nt row of heat-shield tiles.

The damage was spotted during a routine payload bay survey shortly after la=
unch last Friday. NASA's Mission Management Team decided earlier this week =
to extend the shuttle mission by two days and to add a fourth spacewalk, in=
 part to accommodate a repair job. The team ultimately decided to add the b=
lanket work to the third spacewalk today.

Olivas had no problems gently tapping the peeled-back blanket down flat. An=
d he had no problems using the stapler and later, inserting steel pins thro=
ugh the blanket and into nearby heat-shield tiles.

Temperatures climb to between 700 and 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit on the upper=
 surfaces of the rocket pods during re-entry and while the torn blanket did=
 not appear to pose a threat to the crew, heat damage was possible to the g=
raphite epoxy structure of the rocket pod. NASA managers decided to play it=
 safe and order a repair.

While Olivas was working on the blanket, Reilly installed a hydrogen valve =
on the Destiny laboratory module to support the eventual operation of a new=
 U.S. oxygen generator. Then both astronauts turned their attention to comp=
leting the retraction of the P6-2B solar array.

The P6 array was attached to the station in 2000 to provide power during th=
e early stages of assembly. Now, NASA needs to move it to the left end of t=
he station's main power truss to prepare the complex for the delivery of th=
e European and Japanese research modules.

During retraction of the P6-4B array last December, the astronauts ran into=
 major problems and ultimately had to stage an unplanned spacewalk to fold =
the blankets back in their storage boxes. This time around, the Atlantis as=
tronauts have taken a more deliberate, step-by-step approach, retracting th=
e array about 28 feet before a spacewalk Wednesday in which Pat Forrester a=
nd Steve Swanson manually cleared hangups and ultimately got the 115-foot-l=
ong array in about half way.

The central mast of the array was pulled in another few feet by remote cont=
rol Thursday and today, Reilly and Olivas finished the job.

"We had a really good spacewalk today," said lead Flight Director Kelly Bec=
k. "The crew did an excellent job and we accomplished everything we planned=
."

Reilly now ranks 23rd on the list of most experienced spacewalkers, with 30=
 hours and 43 minutes of EVA time over five excursions.
