I've sometimes come across sites where a w2k or w2k3 DC is in use but
ADS is totally broken. It used to be that in a pinch you could use rpc
instead, but now winbind insists on working out for itself if ADS is
supported and using ADS anyway. Unfortunately sometimes this doesn't
work, and ADS is just too badly broken on the DC to work. Windows
clients cope with this, but winbind doesn't.

It would be great to improve the auto-detection, but I'd also like to
suggest the following override:

--- source/nsswitch/winbindd_cm.c       2007-04-11 15:41:35 +0000
+++ source/nsswitch/winbindd_cm.c       2007-05-22 05:50:36 +0000

                  domain->name, domain->active_directory ? "" : "NOT "));

+       /* allow override for using ads - a last ditch approach for domain controllers

+               DEBUG(0,("Overriding active directory detecting - disabling ADS\n"));
+       }

so when you are pulling your hair out and can't get an admin to fix a
broken DC, you can at least get something working by setting
"winbind:ads = no" as a last desperate measure.

The world is full of broken DCs. We need a way to work with them, sad
as that may be.

Cheers, Tridge
