A horrible thing has happened recently.

Messages from usenet seem to be appearing here.

I remember that messages posted to the list were reflected to the 
newsgroup perl.beginners, but newsgroup posts to perl.beginners didn't 
seem to show up here. Now they do :_(

I hope this is just a configuration mistake--not a change in policy. We 
definitely don't need usenet participants participating here. We have a 
pretty nice list. People are good to one another. Some of the junk that 
goes on on usenet doesn't need to happen here.

People who want usenet should subscribe to usenet newsgroups. I 
shouldn't have to see usenet happen on a mailing list I like. Whoever is 
in charge, I implore you to change the configuration of the maillist so 
that these usenet message don't come here any more.
