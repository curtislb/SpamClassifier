Not to sound whiney (but I probably do and more so since I have a  
cold) but somewhere it would be nice if there was a Linux->Mac  
migration on some of this stuff.

I haven't used Windows in 10 years @ home and picked up a Mac this  
weekend.
I've just assumed that everything that is native on Linux would be  
native on a Mac.
