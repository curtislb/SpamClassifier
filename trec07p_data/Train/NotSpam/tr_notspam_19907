If you read the kernel FAQ it states that even if a fresh kernel from 
source you should do mrproper because there is a chance that some 
old stuff gets left behind when they package it. Better safe than sorry, 
always do mrproper before building a kernel. It can't hurt anything 
and does make sure there are no old deps or object modules around. 
mrproper is a superset of clean so if you do that you don't need to 
also do clean.

Also, it doesn't seem right to copy an existing  .config after doing the 
speakup patch. The speakup patch adds new items into .config after 
speakup is selected in menuconfig, the CONFIG_SPEAKUP and 
other related entries. If you copied in a .config from a kernel without 
speakup then it won't have the speakup stuff in .config. If you copy 
some existing .config then it may not match the kernel that you are
compiling from source. If it's the same kernel version that you used 
before it will work, but if you now have a newer kernel it may or 
may not work, and you might be missing some new stuff that's in the 
newer kernel version. 

It is a pain to go through the config, but worthwhile to understand 
what you need and don't for your hardware. There is so much in 
the kernel that is not needed on most systems. If you set all those
to not be included, then you have a whole lot less to compile.
