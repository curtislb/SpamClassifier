Google Groups posts to perl.beginners are showing up in the mailing list 
beginners[at]perl.org.

Are you sure that's not nntp.perl.org? Thunderbird says it can't connect 
to news.perl.org, and nntp.perl.org does not seem to allow posting.

For whatever reasons, some usenet servers carry perl.beginners. 
Traditionally, posts to the perl.beginners newsgroup didn't appear in 
the mailing list. Now they do, and all such posts I've found have 
originated from Google.

This seems to have started around the 23rd of May.
