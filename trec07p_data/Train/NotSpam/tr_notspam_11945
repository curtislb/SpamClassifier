It looks like you didn't see the existing script. Here it is:
http://www.debian.org/mirror/anonftpsync

http://www.debian.org/mirror/

For setting up new mirrors, make sure you notice
http://www.debian.org/mirror/ftpmirror

The project/trace directory.

The timestamp of the file named as the mirror you are using in the
project/trace directory.

Yes. Both are used, I think.

There is no single marker, other than an additional file/directory in the
dists/ directory.

> Is there a way to tell when the available archs change?

Ditto. The Contents-*.gz files could be an easy way to scan for changes.

Now this is getting ridiculous... read the Debian FAQ?

http://www.debian.org/doc/FAQ/ch-ftparchives.en.html

Maybe some question is not answered, but please ask non-generic questions
after reading that.

> How are source files distinguished from others?

With filename extensions.

We do not support mirroring a single distro; there's no observable purpose
to it. If you want a single distribution, mirror its CD/DVD images.

> What all files are required to fully mirror a single arch?

http://www.debian.org/mirror/ftpmirror#partial

> What are the minimal files required for installation only of
> a single arch?

Hmm. I don't think we have this documented anywhere properly, because
the netinst CD gets all the debs of the base system, and optionally gets
whatever is in the tasks that the user selects. Those various sets of
packages are fairly intricate...

As we only support removal of architectures, you can simply check the fourth
column of http://www.debian.org/mirror/list if you want to find how each
mirror is limited (which architectures are missing).
