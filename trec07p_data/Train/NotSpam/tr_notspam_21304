Rebecca -

This sounds similar to some of my ideas for "Collage"...allowing
combinations of text, drawing, image, and other media formats in a freeform
canvas.  The response there seemed that Etoys was, in many ways, already
providing such a thing.  I think this is a really interesting area though,
and the potential to be able to send multimedia documents around,
specifically in an educational environment, is huge. Do you have more
thoughts on specifically how this could be distinguished from Etoys?
Additionally, there is the Sophie project, but I'm not that familiar with it
or how far along they've come with the project on the XO.

- Eben
