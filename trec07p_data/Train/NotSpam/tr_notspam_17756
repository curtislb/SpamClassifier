Terry, I think the idea is that people will make copies for their friends, 
while not technically costless, it is close enough to it not to matter to 
much in my book.

My isp subscription is paid for no matter what I use it for. I could try and 
allocate the cost to the various things I do online, but it is hardly worth 
it for my personal account.

And I will gladly make and send copies of Free art that I like that I think my 
friends might also like.

The "costs" of my time to listen are more than the costs of the link.

I think that the point is that it doesn't need to be done commercially.

Also, isn't this predicated on the music being paid for up front (production) 
and then being Free and free to distribute?

Well, you know I don't like NC, but I think that was not in this picture. 
Someone let me know if I was mistaken or mixed up threads...
