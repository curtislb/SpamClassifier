The following bill is being considered this term by the Maine legislature.  The core of it requires "that there be a reasonable relationship between the pricing of a licensed product, the public investment in that product and the health and safety needs of the public. The State of Maine may require that this relationship be supported by reasonable evidence."  Off-line comments welcome.

2. Purpose.   The institute, through a public and private partnership, shall encourage, promote, stimulate and support research and development activity leading to the commercialization of new products and services in the State's technology-intensive industrial sectors to enhance the competitive position of those sectors and increase the likelihood that one or more of the sectors will support clusters of industrial activity , to promote the widest possible use of taxpayer-funded inventions and to create new jobs for Maine people. The institute is one element of the State's economic development strategy and will contribute to the long-term development of a statewide research, development and product deployment infrastructure.

Sec. 7. 5 MRSA §15303, sub-§3,  as enacted by PL 1999, c. 401, Pt. AAA, §3, is amended to read:

The rules regarding waivers must require the institute to balance the State's contribution to the development of the technology, the importance of the technology to the public's health and welfare with the likelihood that consumers will be able to afford the technology if the waiver is granted.

reasonable pricing policies

§ 15331.   Reasonable pricing policies

1.  Public benefit retained in intellectual property.   All taxpayer-funded research is subject to the following policies:

A.  Licensing agreements for the commercialization of intellectual property will presumptively be nonexclusive; and

B.  Any exclusive licensing agreement for the commercialization of intellectual property must include the following language: "The State of Maine has an interest that there be a reasonable relationship between the pricing of a licensed product, the public investment in that product and the health and safety needs of the public. The State of Maine may require that this relationship be supported by reasonable evidence."

2.  Reasonable pricing policies established.   Reasonable pricing policies apply to all taxpayer-funded research, including, but not limited to, research conducted by or funded by the University of Maine System, the Department of Economic and Community Development and the Maine Technology Institute.

Sec. 11. Study. The Maine Technology Institute Director, referred to in this section as "the director," shall convene a working group to conduct a study and convene at least 4 meetings to develop and gather information necessary to establish reasonable pricing policies for all taxpayer-funded research and make recommendations for changes in state laws and rules to ensure that commercialization and the development of intellectual property from taxpayer-funded research is widely available to the State and its citizens at a reasonable price. The director shall seek to include in the working group representatives from the Department of Economic and Community Development, Office of Innovation; an attorney with the University of Maine School of Law's intellectual property program; consumer advocacy groups; the University of Maine System; and the business community.

The working group has the authority to inspect any agreement that concerns taxpayer-funded research and any agreement to which a public entity or statutorily created corporation is a party, with the proviso that all members are required to keep this information confidential. The working group shall review the following:

1. Addressing the extent to which taxpayer-financed research inures to the benefit of the private sector and how the State can benefit from maintaining patent rights;

2. Recommending favorable pricing policies for taxpayer-funded research;

3. Identifying differences between intellectual property policies between institutions conducting taxpayer-funded research and recommending a uniform policy to be adopted by this Legislature;

4. Assessing compliance with existing conflict-of-interest policies for the commercialization of intellectual property; and

5. Cataloging the State's intellectual property portfolio, specifically describing the relationship between the price of each taxpayer-funded invention, the public investment in the invention and the health and safety needs of the public.

The Maine Technology Institute Director is authorized to use any future bond proceeds to hire an expert in the field of intellectual property law and existing administrative funds to fulfill the requirements of the study. The director shall provide an interim report, with any necessary proposed legislation, to the Joint Standing Committee on Business, Research and Economic Development and the Joint Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs on the progress of the study and any preliminary proposals for establishing reasonable pricing policies by November 1, 2007. The director shall submit a final report to the Joint Standing Committee on Business, Research and Economic Development and the Joint Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs on the progress of the study and any preliminary proposals for establishing reasonable pricing policies by February 1, 2008.

summary

This bill establishes policies for the use of taxpayer-funded research in the private sector to maximize the return on investment for the public's benefit and to create a uniform policy for the transfer of taxpayer-funded research into the private sector. It also requires the Maine Technology Institute Director, in consultation with the Department of Economic and Community Development, Office of Innovation and an attorney with the University of Maine School of Law's intellectual property program and with participation from consumer advocacy groups, the University of Maine System and the business community, to perform a study to develop and gather information necessary to establish reasonable pricing policies for all taxpayer-funded research and make recommendations for changes in state laws and rules to ensure that commercialization and the development of intellectual property from taxpayer-funded research is widely available to the State and its citizens at a reasonable price.
