The problem is that those third-party sources are linked into the Bacula 
binaries, and since they are licensed as GPL with no modifications, I cannot 
include them in a binary that has code that is licensed in a way that is 
incompatible with the GPL.  Adding the OpenSSL exception to my license makes 
my code incompatible with the non-modified GPL, and hence I was violating the 
license on those 3rd party files (copyrighted by FSF, ATT, Sun, and a few 
others ...).
