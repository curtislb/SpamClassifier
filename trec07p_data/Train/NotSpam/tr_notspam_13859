Lonely they carp and pseudo gasp but at this stage at
this distance the wonder is they still exist.  Why and
what for?  As for SHE HERSELF, ensconced on the high
cliff in windy ways she picks off stragglers and
strugglers on the beach far far far below with her fat
cross fat eyes while she sips slurps and slicks at
juices white black red orange trucked from Waitrose
with containers spattered with Salcombe sand... where
the boats heave and ho and tilt in wilting tide
fathoming as stranded fish struggle and wriggle white
bellies up and HER  wellies green-as-gold glint like
the bint she used to be once I swear... but now it’s
all this squat used-tune saleslady with her faggot of
failing fanlets… 

But courage, mes amis!  Mayhaps the answer might be
another bout of... 

ahem, performance stalking.

More soon…
