Pat,

went down this road and it ain't pretty. During of the month of 
frustration (mostly due to lack of in-depth documentation from 
Microsoft). I have came across the Flex Profile Kit 
(www.loginconsultants.com) which basically provides for workable 
solution and did the complete trick for me. It comes with detailed 
manual on how to set it up. I am not a developer, from the perspective 
of an sysadmin - it works and seem to work well (now in production for 4 
months).

regards,
Ladislav.
