welcomes Braziliand decision to issue a compulsory licence on a key
anti-aids drug. Socialists MEPs "called for support for those countries

medicines for their people. Brazil has recently followed Thailand in
invoking the flexibility provision of the Declaration. " and highlight
"the need to encourage countries to make the Doha Declaration a reality
and to stop future threats to public health interests by the
pharmaceutical lobby or rich countries protecting their interests. Let's
make sure developing countries can make use of their legal rights."

SOCIALISTS WELCOME BRAZILIAN DECISION ON ANTI-AIDS DRUG

Socialists MEPs today called for support for those countries intending to
use the Doha Declaration in order to ensure access to medicines for their
people. Brazil has recently followed Thailand in invoking the flexibility
provision of the Declaration.

The Socialist 'shadow' on the parliamentary report on intellectual
property rights (TRIPS), Kader Arif, said: "It is obvious that people in
many developing countries cannot afford medicines which are manufactured
on a commercial basis. Peoples' health must come before profits. Over
200,000 people die every day as a result of AIDS, malaria and
tuberculosis. EU governments should clearly demonstrate their support for
Brazil's actions."

Max van den Berg, vice-president of the Development Committee and
spokesperson for the PSE Group on Development stressed: "We already have
an international agreement in 'the Doha Declaration' which states that
'the TRIPS Agreement does not and should not prevent members from taking
measures to protect public health'.

"We need to encourage countries to make the Doha Declaration a reality and
to stop future threats to public health interests by the pharmaceutical
lobby or rich countries protecting their interests. Let's make sure
developing countries can make use of their legal rights.

"Compulsory licensing is an effective solution to the crisis of access to
essential medicines in developing countries - according to the Thailand
Government prices have already dropped to less than half of what they cost
before. This will allow 20,000 more new patients to be put on anti-retro
viral treatment and it is expected that the price may go down even
further."
