Further to Simon's points,

Here is what is confusing to me and I highlight the section of the claims below:

The key assumption concerns "symmetrical error constraints". These "symmetrical error constraints" force a solution where the probabilities of positive and negative error are symmetrical across all cross product sums that are the basis of maximum likelihood logistic regression. As the number of independent variables increases, it becomes more and more likely that this symmetrical assumption is accurate. Because this error component can be reliably estimated and subtracted out with a large enough number of variables, the resulting model parameters are strikingly error-free and do not overfit the data. 

For me, maybe this is a bit old school here, but isn't the point of model development generating the most parsimonious model with the greatest explanatory power from the fewest variables.  I myself could just imagine going to a client and standing in a 'bored' (grin) room for a presentation, and saying hay client, here are the 200 variables that are driving choice behaviour.  I use latent class and bayes based approaches because they recover heterogeneity in utility allocation across the sample, that to me is a big battle in choice based analytics.  

I believe that after a certain point, a heap of predictors become meaningless.  I can see some of my colleagues adopting this because it is in SAS and makes up for poor design.  

Anyway, from a technical point of view, I would have to read a little about the error they are referring to.  Good on them for developing a new technology, like any algorithm, it will have its strengths and weaknesses and depending on factors such as usability etc, will gain some level of acceptance.
