Hello list,
I just installed debian on my AMD.
When I took it to the penteum 3, it says:
waiting for root filesystem.
When I put it back in am, it boots perfectly.
I would like to install another hd, and get my stuff off of it, But, the problem there, is that when I do that, it just sits at compac, and doesn't move.
Any help would really be appriciated. I've got lots of work on those, and would like to keep moving with my projects.
Thanks,
~~TheCreator~~
