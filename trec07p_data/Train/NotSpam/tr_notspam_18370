Probably not. I am used to the osc protocol and successfully used it in 
another project. So it was easy for me to use it in memosono as well. I 
will read through the telepathy specs which probably has features I 
haven't thought of yet.

cool. I have seen that this is used in the connect activity. I will read 
through this code then.

I am not sure I get you right here - do you mean the deviation of 
distributed audio clocks? osc is only about control messages so this 
should not impose any problems here.

Thanks for the insights,
