Umm, never mind.  I just realized that introducing a postfix:<.>
operator would complicate matters in unexpected ways by forcing
infix:<.> to require disambiguating whitespace, as per S02.  This
would be Very Bad in several ways, e.g., an infixed dot is given as
the appropriate way to separate a postfix operator from the term in
front of it when whitespace is forbidden.  Or the fact that 'foo.bar'
would no longer parse as expected.  :sigh:
