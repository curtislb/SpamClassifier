To put it in language you'll understand, that stinks.  Not everyone
wants to use a gui interface.  There are still functions under the gui
that are not accessible.  As for the argument that Speakup is not
popular, you have only to look at the number of Speakup users on this
list.  As for the maintenance issue, speakup is no more difficult to
maintain than any other of the hundreds of modules that habitually are 
included.  The thing that makes building your own kernel more difficult
is Ubuntu's insistence on using an initrd for a standard system.  All
the extra hardware discovery stuff isn't necessary once a system is
installed.  Besides which, without speakup, there is no way to do a
server install, and Speakup has never been included in a manner that
would allow a blind person to do an install from a server cd.  Mot to
mention the times when Orca or Gnome crashes in some fashion, and the
only way to recover things is by using Speakup from a text console.  If
you really have maintenence issues, talk to Kirk and find a way to
resolve them.  I think the decission to drop Speakup from Ubuntu is
extreemly short sighted.
