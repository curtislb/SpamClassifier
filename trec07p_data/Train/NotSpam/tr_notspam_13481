rsync will check the integrity of existing files if used with option -c.
However this puts a high load on the server so many of them disable
its use. A debian mirror does not need to allow it.

The default is to not use -c; in this case only the date and length
are used to decide if a file should be updated.

One can use the checksums in indices/md5sums.gz to verify the files
locally. Very useful indeed... I do it periodically, because a mirror
is a significant responsibility.
