Sorry, apparently nothing.
The problem was related to a broken DNS configuration.

I still don't know, why the first run through ads_kinit_password
succeeds (as I'm not familiar with the kerberos internals), but the
later calls depend on successfull responses to
"SRV _kerberos._udp.MY.DOMAIN.COM" and related DNS-requests. This has no
effect, if the ccache is not deleted - which caused the difference in
the behaviour of 3.0.25rc3 and 3.0.25.

Bye,
Martin
