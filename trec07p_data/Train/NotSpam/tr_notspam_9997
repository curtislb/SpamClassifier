> And to attract contributors, you have to have a convincing vision.

right

please make a decision for you to program in a language that has fame
or one that you like most. as moritz said the special variables are now 
better sorted and some changes you write about are too far from perls
basic principles, i thank that would not be perl anymore. but even for
demands like yours it is thought as 2 or 3 lisp-style macros could
turn perl6 into something your seems to want. except that one with
type recognition of course which i cant think of how to make this work
with an macro.

but hey since parrot also will read python you would not run too far
if you try python. i think you could only win if you try it. maybe youll find 
problems with python you didnt thought abd be than better informed 
of or found your  favoured programming lang.
