     That's just the initial cost.  The company has to stay in business. 
  That means weekly paychecks for all it's employees so they can support 
their own families.  Even if you sell a few hundred copies this month, 
next month's bills are just around the corner.  Even if the government 
pays it all, your customer base is still microscopic.  It's not fair, 
but that's life. <shrugs>
