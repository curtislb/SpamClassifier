Ahh, I understand now.
It's not so much the fact that the file doesn't have the info, but  
that it's not in a format you can use right?
That is easy to fix.
Simply read in the file, and ignore all the fields except the one with  
the ip in it.
I've not done this for a while, so give me a few days.  I'll generate  
some code for you to use.  I'm assuming bash is your shell?
If not, I could work up something in perl for you to use.
Drop me a line with a copy of the ipdeny file, and what you want it to  
look like when it's done, and I'll see what I can do.
