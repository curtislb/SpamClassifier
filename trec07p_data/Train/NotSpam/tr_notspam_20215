Hi John

Three problems here that I can see:

- Perl won't do an in-place edit successfully on a Windows system. You
  have to specify a name for the old file to be renamed to.

- It is the command shell on Unix systems that expands the wildcard
  into a list of filenames. On Windows your program sees just the single
  argument '*'.

- You have written no code to process the arguments passed. You program
  is simply

    s/old/new/

  which will just try to replace 'old' with 'new' in an uninitialised $_
  variable (try perl -w -i -e "s/old/new/" * to see the evidence).

I suggest you use something like

  perl -w -i.bak -p -e "s/old/new/"

but I haven't tested this as you already have a directory set up ready to
try it on :)

HTH,

Rob
