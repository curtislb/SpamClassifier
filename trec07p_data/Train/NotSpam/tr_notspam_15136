Phase 2 of the UML Tool Assembly Competition is now open for registration. This phase of the assembly adds class diagrams, printing, and other functionality to the final Phase 1 application to complete the tool. You can learn more details about exactly what is required by reading the details in the link below.

The UML Tool will be used by TopCoder members, as part of the component competitions, to design and develop software. It will also be used by TopCoder staff to design and review components.
