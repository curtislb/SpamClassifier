other, that you can boast about it."=20
- Bertrand Russell=20

TONIGHT ON THE CBS EVENING NEWS
<http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/eveningnews/main3420.shtml>=20

Here is an early preview of what we are planning for tonight's CBS
EVENING NEWS from Anchor and Managing Editor, Katie Couric...=20

Hi everyone,=20

After the town of Greensburg, Kansas, was reduced to little more than
rubble over the weekend, a survivor was found in the wreckage today -
bringing some good news to the grim story. Hari Sreenivasan will have
our report on the aftermath from Greensburg.=20

When a disaster like this massive tornado strikes, the National Guard is
often called upon to help citizens piece together broken lives. But
during wartime, the guard isn't always there in full force, David Martin
will report.=20

Reports said the tornado was more than a mile wide and it was a whopping
F-5 storm - the classification for the very strongest twisters. What's
behind such a monster tornado? Cynthia Bowers will have the story from a
storm prediction center in Norman, Oklahoma.=20

In business news, prices at the gas pump surged over the weekend,
reaching $4.00 per gallon in some places. Anthony Mason will have the
reasons behind the pump price spike.=20

Yesterday French voters elected Nicholas Sarkozy, the pro-American
conservative candidate, in a close election that had a huge turnout. But
would the French candidates' personal lives horrify American voters?
Jeff Greenfield will take a look at what American voters can learn from
some of the culture behind France's election.=20

And correspondent John Blackstone reports on what some are calling an
agricultural emergency in the United States: the sudden disappearance of
honeybees. The die-off has hit 27 states - and with about 30 percent of
the nation's food supply being pollinated by bees, the risk is great and
scientists are scrambling to nail down the cause. We'll have the story
in a segment we're calling Saving the World.=20

Finally, it was a day of much pomp and fanfare at the White House, as
Queen Elizabeth II was welcomed to Washington. President Bush tonight is
hosting the first white-tie dinner of his presidency in honor of the
queen. Mark Phillips will share details of Elizabeth's elegant day
inside the beltway.=20

I hope you'll join us. Katie=20

TUESDAY MORNING ON THE EARLY SHOW
<http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/earlyshow/main500202.shtml>=20

Hannah Storm, Julie Chen, Russ Mitchell and Chris Wragge, of our New
York affiliate WCBS, anchor THE EARLY SHOW from New York. Dave Price
will bring us the weather. Harry Smith is on assignment.=20

Along with the top news of the day, we will also have the following
stories:=20

CONSUMERWATCH: RATING DIETS: If you're anxious about fitting into that
bathing suit this summer, you're not alone. Right now, nearly half of
all Americans are on a diet--with the average person wanting to lose
more than 30 pounds! So what's the best way to do it? Consumer Reports
magazine has done the homework for you--revealing which diets get the
best results. EARLY SHOW Consumer Correspondent Susan Koeppen will join
us with important new information about diet plans.=20
=20
TAKE LOU: GAS PRICES: In his weekly commentary, Lou Dobbs, anchor and
managing editor of CNN's Lou Dobbs Tonight, will join us to talk about
gas prices.=20

SIMPLE SOLUTIONS: DRUG STORE DEALS: Walk down an aisle at your local
drugstore and it's easy to get overwhelmed by the hundreds of beauty
products you can choose from. So the editors at Real Simple magazine
compiled a list of the best drugstore skincare and hair products to save
you time and money the next time you're shopping. Kris Connell from Real
Simple magazine will join us with some of her favorites.=20

CSI WEEK: CSI MIAMI BEHIND THE SCENES: Tuesday morning, we continue CSI
week. Monday night's CSI: Miami has your standard dose of stylized
murder and intrigue in an exotic setting. What it also has is Horatio
being Horatio. To the delight of millions of fans, each week actor David
Caruso puts his stamp on what has become one of television's most iconic
characters. We'll take a look behind the scenes of the hit show.=20

MOTHER'S DAY GIFTS: Don't know what to get mom this Mother's day? Style
expert Sarah Shirley will join us with some gift suggestions that may be
the perfect way for you to thank mom for all she does.=20

DENNIS HAYSBERT ON THE UNIT: Dennis Haysbert is best known to television
audiences for his portrayal of President David Palmer on the series 24,
for which he received his first Golden Globe nomination. Now, he stars
as Jonas Blane on The Unit, one of CBS's biggest hits. The Unit offers a
realistic look at a group of elite special forces fighting terrorism in
all corners of the world. Tuesday night's cliff hanger season finale
will show you what the buzz is about, when The Unit, led by Haysbert's
character, face criminal charges that threaten it's very existence.
We'll speak with Haysbert Tuesday morning.=20

YOUNG AT HEART: HOT GRANNY: Grandmothers aren't what they used to be.
"Hot" and "grandmother" are not two words you usually think of together,
but gerontologist Mel Walsh's new book, Hot Granny, says otherwise.
Walsh's book defines what exactly makes a grandmother sizzle. How you
can accept the limitations brought on by age and learn to reinvent
yourself? Hot Granny is filled with practical advice on how to be happy,
healthy and sexy into your golden years. Tuesday morning, Walsh will
join us with tips you won't want to miss.=20
