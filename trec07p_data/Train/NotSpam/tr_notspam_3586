						<div class=3D"GreyHeading">BRENDAN FOSTER ON THE LONDON MARATHON</div>
						<div>Every April millions of people around the UK watch the London Ma=
rathon, and in sitting rooms up and down the country someone will lean acro=
ss to their partner and say: "I could do that".=20
<br>

<br>
That's the beauty of the London Marathon and what makes it a unique top-cla=
ss sporting event - anyone can start running and sign up to take part.=20
<br>

<br>
And it's not just a one-day event, participants have to change their lifest=
yles, get fit and of course raise millions for charity.=20
<br>

<br>
A healthy contingent of celebrities put themselves through the mill too whi=
ch is fantastic.=20
<br>

<br>
Seeing Zombie Ramsay or Matt Dawson running 26 miles makes people think: "I=
f he can do it, so can I," and that provides so much encouragement and insp=
iration.=20
<br>

<br>
For the more serious athletes, the line-up for the men's elite race is argu=
ably the strongest marathon field ever assembled.=20
<br>

<br>
The likes of Haile Gebrselassie, Paul Tergat, Felix Limo and Khalid Khannou=
chi reads like a Who's Who of distance running.=20
<br>

<br>
For me Gebrselassie is the one to watch. He decided after his glittering tr=
ack career that the marathon was going to be his event.=20
<br>

<br>
He didn't take to it too kindly at first, but he's adapted his training, ap=
proached things differently and is now bang in form.=20
<br>

<br>
As far as British interest is concerned we are once again relying on Jon Br=
own.=20
<br>

<br>
He has been a great athlete for his country and is our only male world-clas=
s marathon runner but I don't expect him to feature, which can also be said=
 of Liz Yelling in the women's elite race.=20
<br>

<br>
Lornah Kiplagat is my favourite for that event after her performance holdin=
g off the challenge of the Ethiopians at the recent World Cross Country Cha=
mpionships.=20
<br>

<br>
She will face the might of Berhane Adere and Gete Wami on Sunday, but I thi=
nk she is strong enough to prevail again.=20
<br>

<br>
Enjoy the race,=20
<br>

<br>
Brendan=20
<br>

<br>
<b>Brendan Foster MBE will be commentating on Sunday's London Marathon (cov=
erage starts at 0830 BST on BBC ONE).
<br>
During his athletics career he won an Olympic bronze medal in the 10,000m a=
nd broke two world records.</b></div></td>
