Yes. It is my understanding that it is violating the letter of the
GFDL.

I believe most of us agree on this point, which is why the status quo
of a work present in non-free hasn't been seriously challenged. You'll
note though, that we do not (and cannot) distribute gcc-4.1.1(7)
seprately from gpl(7); there is a versioned dependency between those
packages.

The Developers as a whole decided that the problems with invariant
sections and the GFDL were sufficient enough to exclude them from
main. However, the maintainer (and the developers) recognized that
users may need or want such documentation, even though it does not
meet the DFSG, so the documentation was made available in non-free.

If you disagree with the determination of the Developers, you can
easily install the work from non-free, or cease supporting Debian in
its entirety. The choice is yours, really.
