Dear all -

As many of you know, UAEM held our first National Day of Action on
Wednesday. I wanted to send a short wrap-up. Several of you on this
list spoke at events for the Day or leading up to it. We want to
express our thanks to you for helping to make it a great success.

We are still collecting news from all our chapters, but we believe
the day was a major stride in educating and motivating UAEM's fast-
growing student base. More than 40 chapters across the U.S., U.K.,
and Canada participated. Through the work of all these students, the
pressure on universities to take their rightful role in the access to
medicines battle is growing rapidly.

Summudles of many of the day of action events are up at http://
www.essentialmedicine.org/action. Many of our chapters have also
posted photos on our flickr group at http://www.flickr.com/groups/
uaem/. We'll be further updating these pages over the coming days. We
hope you will take a minute to look, and be inspired by the many
students who will become a generation of leaders in this fight.

We've also included below one representative story from our Yale
chapter's event, to give you a taste, as well as our press release
for the day.

Sincerely yours,

Michael and Robynn
Executive Directors
Universities Allied for Essential Medicines

>
> NEW HAVEN -- More than 10 million people die each year because they
> can't afford essential medicines, the World Health Organization
> estimates.
>
> Some of those drugs are discovered at American universities,  with
> public money, but by the time the drugs make it to market,
> they're  priced beyond reach of millions of people in poor  countries.
>
> Activists are calling on universities to help make their life-
> saving discoveries affordable to all. At Yale and dozens of  other
> campuses on Wednesday, students called on administrators  to
> rethink their licensing agreements with drug companies to
> increase  global access to medicines.
>
> At Yale, students left a pill bottle sculpture outside President
> Rick Levin's office. Made of 2,700 yellow pill bottles, it was
> meant to symbolize the 27,000 people who die each day for lack of
> medicine.
>
> "It's evocative," said law student Sarah Mehta, while threading
> wire through the bottles several nights ago in a machine shop on
> campus. "People have become desensitized to the numbers."
>
> The movement to expand access to medicines began at Yale six years
> ago, amid outrage that AIDS patients in Africa were dying as
> Bristol-Myers Squibb charged exorbitant prices for a drug developed
> at Yale, sold under the brand Zerit. Public pressure led the
> company to slash the price of Zerit and allow generic copies to be
> made.
>
> The victory led to the creation of a national advocacy group,
> Universities Allied for Essential Medicines, to persuade schools to
> negotiate low-cost medicines for poor countries when  striking
> licensing deals with drug companies.
>
> Last fall, a group of public health leaders - including four Nobel
> Laureates and the former editor-in-chief of the New England Journal
> of Medicine - signed a statement in  Philadelphia calling on
> universities to improve access to medicines and promote  research
> on neglected diseases.
>
> Last month, the Association of American Medical Colleges and 11
> universities, including Yale, responded with a statement of their
> own, affirming their obligation to help people suffering  from
> preventable or curable diseases. But they made no promises.
>
> That's a sticking point for activists. At Yale, more than two dozen
> drugs to treat cancer, HIV/AIDS and other illnesses are in the
> pipeline. Students want to make sure that when the drugs come to
> fruition, there will be allowances.
>
> "Every day that this remains just a set of principles on paper
> instead of concrete steps, there's a real human cost," said Michael
> Steffen, a Yale law student.
>
> Jon Ungphakorn, an AIDS activist and former Thai senator, spoke
> at  the law school Wednesday. It was his first stop on a tour  to
> protest Abbott Laboratories' recent withdrawal of seven new  drugs
> from Thailand, which came after Thailand threatened to  make a
> generic version of Abbott's anti-AIDS drug, Kaletra.
>
> Recently, Abbott announced it would cut the price of Kaletra by
> more than half but hasn't budged on its decision to keep some
> drugs off market.
>
> Ungphakorn wore a T-shirt with the words, "Worldwide Boycott
> Abbott." His American tour will culminate this month with a  stop
> at Abbott's annual shareholder meeting in Chicago.
>
> "It's important that universities show moral leadership," he
> said,  after snapping pictures of the pill bottle sculpture at
> Yale.  "It's very, very exciting seeing young students taking  the
> lead."
>
> In February, students met with Levin, an economist with  expertise
> in patents, to discuss their concerns. Law student  Shayna Strom
> faced his office Wednesday, her back to the pill  bottle sculpture.
>
> "President Levin, you have the power to be a leader on this  issue
> to make sure Yale's research goes to the public good,"  she said
> rhetorically, since it was clear Levin was nowhere to  be seen.
> "We  call on you to include access provisions in Yale's  licenses
> with  pharmaceutical companies - not some of the time,  for
> individual  drugs, but all of the time."

> National Day of Action Targets Universities in Fight for Global
> Access to Medicines
>
> PHILADELPHIA, Pa. As the fight for affordable AIDS treatment comes
> to a head around the world, with litigation in India, a showdown in
> Thailand, and heated debate in the U.S. Congress, a growing
> national student movement erupted on nearly 50 campuses today,
> demanding universities recognize their own role in the access
> crisis.  Students at top research institutions - including Harvard,
> U.C. Berkeley, and Johns Hopkins - joined a National Day of Action
> calling for lifesaving drugs developed in campus laboratories to be
> made available in the developing world.
>
> In recent months, universities have come under increasing pressure
> to ensure that the benefit of their biomedical research extends to
> the global poor. In November, more than 100 luminaries in medicine,
> law, and public health endorsed the “Philadelphia Consensus
> Statement,” calling for change at universities.  Meanwhile U.S.
> Senator Patrick Leahy (VT) introduced legislation that would
> mandate humanitarian licensing terms like those the Statement urged
> universities to adopt voluntarily.  On the heels of these
> developments, eleven leading universities publicly recognized their
> responsibility to ensure university research benefit the world’s
> poor . But, to date, not a single one has put the principle into
> practice for an actual drug with a global market.
>
> Thus, student activity reached a new pitch today with coordinated
> activity across the country. “There is now broad consensus that
> universities have a responsibility to ensure their research
> benefits people of all nations,” said Anna Weiss, a medical student
> at University of Pennsylvania,. “But we must move from rhetoric to
> action. Promising drug candidates continue to be licensed to
> pharmaceutical companies without any strategy for access to
> developing world patients.  Our message today is simple: Delay has
> a human cost.”
>
> To highlight that cost, Yale students constructed a haunting
> display of 2700 glowing pill bottles to commemorate the 27,000
> people that will die on the National Day of Action alone due to
> lack of access to existing medicines.  At Harvard, Dr. Jim Yong
> Kim, former World Health Organization HIV Director, called on
> students to engage their administrations to change policies, while
> at U.C. Berkeley, a conference of leading research scientists
> focused on ways to speed medical innovations from campuses to
> developing nations.
>
> “Universities can and must play a major role in alleviating the
> global access crisis.” said Dr. Kim, director of the François-
> Xavier Bagnoud Center for Health and Human Rights at the Harvard
> School of Public Health.  “As tightened patent protection under the
> World Trade Organization threatens the supply of affordable
> medicines, universities cannot stand idle while people are dying.”
>
> About Universities Allied for Essential Medicines
>
> Universities Allied for Essential Medicines (UAEM) is a coalition
> of students at over 35 research universities in the United States
> Canada, and the United Kingdom. In 2001, UAEM’s founders helped
> forge a deal between Yale and Bristol-Myers Squibb to lower the
> price of one of the most widely used AIDS drugs by 96% throughout
> sub-Saharan Africa.  The first major patent concession on an AIDS
> drug, the Yale/BMS deal helped create a tipping point for access to
> affordable AIDS treatment. UAEM has since worked to make such
> agreements a standard part of university licensing. The
> organization also works to promote university research on neglected
> diseases predominantly affecting those in impoverished countries.
