I decided to bring out this Hash->Dict topic in a different thread 
from the thread on Synopsis r14407 about Object->Universal since I 
consider them separate though tangential matters that should be 
argued on their individual merits.

In the interest of that Perl data types are better off being named 
primarily after their meaning rather than their implementation, 
probably the current worst offender is Hash.

Barring some better name, I highly recommend/propose renaming Hash to Dict.

The term Dict (as a short form of "dictionary") is well understood by 
general people and is the term used for associative arrays in some 
other languages, so it is easy to learn, and easy to explain to 
people in Learning Perl.

The term Dict is easier for new people to Perl, either new 
programmers or visitors from other languages, to learn than Hash is. 
It allows more self-documenting code where one is used.  And writing 
Learning Perl should be easier.

For Perl 5 people, it should be very easy to adapt, or for the most 
part they may not notice any difference save for documentation 
references.

You also have equal huffmanization since the terms Hash and Dict are 
both of the same length, and they are also equally easy to type.

And aside from the 4 letter word, all the other details associated 
with hashes, eg the % sigil and {} constructor, and parts named 
keys,values,pairs,kv et al can/should remain the same as they are.

In fact, since many users of Perl don't refer to the data type by the 
name Hash but rather just by % or {}, the change may not take from 
their useability at all or they may not even notice that a change 
occurred at all, so easy to adapt.

Of course, if that change is made, KeyHash should be renamed to 
KeyDict, and so forth.

After this change, the term Hash is then freed up to be used more 
specifically to describe an implementation detail of something and/or 
hashing functions et al.

I think this change would be a good thing.

Feedback is appreciated, either pro or con.
