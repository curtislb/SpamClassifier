Actually, the repository has a half-and-half split between "vtable 
method" and "vtable function", with "vtable entry" as a distant third.

There seems to be a lot of confusion on the list lately on the 
difference between vtable thingys and methods. On the "distinction vs. 
similarity" design trade-off, a little distinction is in order here.

Having an invocant isn't the only defining characteristic of a method. 
In this case a more important characteristic is whether the code can be 
called as a method on the object. Methods can, vtable thingys can't.

I'm happy to take suggestions on better names for vtable thingys.

Allison
