English law.

The UK is not England. The UK does *not* *have* a legal system, as 
legally it is two kingdoms, each with their constitutionally guaranteed 
separate legal systems (think of it as if the US congress could pass 
state laws that applied in one or other state, but could not pass laws 
which applied to the entire US as a whole. Weird, I know, but it's the 
system we have).

The UK (yes I know I said we don't have a legal system) is a signatory 
to Berne, which merely guarantees that a foreigner has the same rights 
as the locals. So, as a USian, you can sue in the UK with exactly the 
same rights as a UK subject would have. Which is why, if as a UKian I 
want to sue in the US, I have to register my copyright with the Library 
of Congress just like you have to do.

Cheers,
Wol
