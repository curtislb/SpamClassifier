OK, thanks John. Then I guess it needs some experimentation as it works fine on my
Windows system.

I was hoping it was OK everywhere as it's not ambiguous (only fseek on a terminal
device seems unlikely) and as far as I know the C ftell() function is fine on
STDOUT, or maybe that's platform-dependent too.
