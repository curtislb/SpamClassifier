>From Decoration Day To Memorial Day

A Great Company - Dedicated To Protecting Our Troops

Down A Lazy River

-----

Memorial Day, as most of us know, commemorates the U.S. men and women who
have died in military service to their country.

But when it first became a national holiday in 1868, it was called
Decoration Day, and it was only for honoring - and decorating the tombs of
- fallen Union soldiers.  The Civil War, of course, was the bloodiest of
all America wars, because every man who fell was an American.  And
following the war, it was nearly impossible to find a family - or the
remnants of one - unaffected by the war.  So taking a day to decorate the
graves of lost ones was only natural.

The Confederate states, interestingly, already had various days for
honoring their dead, and most saw no point in changing the date to suit
those northerners who had so recently been killing their menfolk.

World War I, however, proved a major unifier for the north and south; when
two parties join to fight a third power, that's what happens.   
So after that war, most southern states began to observe Decoration Day.

Thirty years later, after World War II, the name Memorial Day became more
commonly used, and finally, in 1967, the name was officially changed to
Memorial Day.

But how many of us actually go to graves on this day to formally remember
our fallen servicemen and women?  Not enough, I'll wager.   And fewer and
fewer every year.  And that's partly because most of the people who
actually remember those dead soldiers have passed on themselves.

Consider the numbers, which reveal a real trend of shrinkage over time.

Revolutionary War      25,324
Civil War - North       363,020
Civil War - South      199,110
World War I               116,708
World War II               408,306
Vietnam War                58,219
Iraq War                         3,434 and counting

With luck, the trend will continue, and the number of lives lost in future
conflicts will dwindle further.  The chief factor in the equation, of
course, is politics, and we all know what a messy battleground that makes.
 Even if we did have a "perfect" president in the White House, there's no
guarantee he'd be able to avoid conflict with the unreasonable leader of
another country.

But if you're going to fight, you want the best equipment, both offensive
and defensive.  From the dawn of civilization, when men fought with spears
and atlatls, technology has mattered.  So, in the interest of reducing the
loss of American lives in the future, I present one stock for today, a
company whose goal is to protect our troops by getting them into the
world's best armored vehicles.

Grow 50% or Pay Nothing!

When Intuitive Surgical represented the best growth story on Wall Street
in August 2004, we quickly named it Stock of the Month.  Since then it's
handed investors 600% gains.

When we could see that Apple Computer's earnings momentum was shooting
through the roof in October 2004, we named it Stock of the Month. It was
selling for a shockingly low $35 per share. Today, (adjusted for a 2-for-1
split) it has turned a $10,000 investment into $43,000.

When the rest of Wall Street felt that Google's best days were behind it
in July 2005, our research said the tear would continue. Six months after
we named it Stock of the Month, my readers saw the stock gain an
incredible $160 a share.

There are 16 more Stocks of the Month I could name that have handed us an
88% average profit per stock over the past two years...

The company's name is Force Protection.  It's based in an old General
Electric turbine factory near Charleston, South Carolina.  And it sells
three models of vehicles.

First, there's the Buffalo, which seats only four and is designed for
mine-clearing.  The Buffalo weighs 45,000 pounds, stands 13 feet tall, is
27 feet long, and can withstand a 30-pound blast of TNT under any wheel
and a 15-pound blast under its centerline.  Powered by a 400 hp Mack
diesel, it has an articulated telescoping boom that can be manipulated to
discover, detonate, and remove explosive devices.  If I had to be in Iraq,
I'd want to be in a Buffalo.

Second, there's the Cougar, which comes in two sizes, the four-wheeled
model and the six-wheeled model.

The four-wheeled model is 19 feet long, weighs 31,000 pounds and can carry
up to ten troops, while keeping them protected from mines, gunfire and
improvised explosive devices (IEDs).  The six-wheeled model is 23 feet
long, weighs 38,000 pounds and can carry 12 troops in the same
conditions.

Both are powered by a 330 hp Caterpillar diesel and can be fitted with a
machine gun on the roof, which can be either manually or remotely
operated.

All of Force Protection's vehicles are designed with a V-shaped bottom
that deflects blast forces away from the vehicle's occupants.   
To date, they've encountered thousands of blasts from both mines and IEDs
(improvised explosive devices) in Iraq and occupants have suffered no
casualties.

New this year (and untested in the field) is the Cheetah.  While the
Buffalo and Cougar can run all day at 55 mph and sprint at 65 mph for
short periods, the Cheetah, powered by a 300 hp Cummins diesel, can cruise
at 75 mph and sprint at 89 mph.  Tipping the scales at "just" 14,000
pounds (the equivalent of two Chevy Suburbans), and accommodating just six
troops, the Cheetah is the lightweight of the family, designed for urban
operations.  Yet it can withstand the same explosive blasts as the
Buffalo!

You might, however, call it the Humvee-killer.

You see, the Humvee, or High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle
(HMMWV), has been in active use by the U.S. military since 1985.  But a
Humvee is not an armored vehicle!  A basic Humvee costs nearly $65,000 and
by the time you add armor the cost is about $140,000.   
But doing so not only shortens the vehicle's useful life because it wears
out more quickly, it also makes it more prone to rollovers . . . and
that's not good for the troops!

So the big story today is that the Cheetah, along with its bigger
siblings, is very likely to be chosen to replace the bulk of the 17,700
Humvees in Iraq.  In all likelihood, the U.S. Army will soon be asking for
some $8 billion for armored vehicles to protect its troops.  The request
is likely to be granted.  And the major beneficiary of the orders that
follow will likely be Force Protection.

In 2004, the company's revenues were $10 million, in 2005 they were $50
million and in 2006 they were $196 million.  That's very impressive
growth.  But imagine what will happen if Uncle Sam comes along with a
multi-billion-dollar order.

It boggles the mind.

Now, I'm not predicting the order will be for $8 billion.  Congress could
easily shrink that number a bit.  And competitors are likely to get a
little of the action, too.  But not much.  Force Protection has 81% of the
market for armored vehicles today.

A look at the competition reveals the Bushmaster from Australia, the Dingo
from Germany, the RG31 made by GD in South Africa, the RG33L by BAE of
Britain, and the ASV by Textron.  For obvious reasons, the U.S. military
would like to buy domestically.  Even more important, the Buffalo and
Cougar have the best safety records, and they cost less than the others,
so the Cheetah is likely to have the inside track.

As for production capability, Force Protection has partnered with General
Dynamics (which will perform structure fabrication of some vehicles) and
Armor Holdings (which will contribute armor) as a way of increasing its
manufacturing capabilities.  It's buying increased manufacturing adjacent
to its current space.  And because it's just 10 miles from the Charleston
Air Force Base in Ladson, South Carolina, it can deliver those vehicles
easily!

Force Protection is already very busy.  In April the company received a
$490 million order to produce 1,000 vehicles for the U.S. Marines, and in
May a nice little $9 million order came in to build Buffalos and Cougars
for the Canadian Expeditionary Force Command.  But it's the promise of
this huge Humvee-replacement business that has investors seeing dollar
signs here.

Of course, this story is not a secret; with every piece of good news, this
stock climbs a little higher.  By some measures, it's expensive today; its
market capitalization is $1.9 million, which is 7 times the past twelve
months' revenues.  The price/earnings ration is 163!

But looking ahead, and assuming that the big U.S. order does come through,
I think the stock is cheap, and that's why I'm recommending it today. 
Ideally, you want to buy when the stock corrects to its 25-day moving
average down around 25.  That's also the level where the stock met
resistance back in January, so it should act as a floor.

And if the stock fails from there, you cut your loss short; nothing is
guaranteed in this business.  But if you manage your risk properly (buying
at the right point is very important in this regard), stories like Force
Protection can pay off very well.

Editor's note:

For the record, Force Protection (FRPT) was first recommended in Cabot Top
Ten Report two weeks ago, when it was trading at 27.  In that write-up,
editor Mike Cintolo suggested buying between 23 and 26, and the stock in
fact did fall smack into that range two days later.  If you'd like
continued updates on the status of Force Protection, as well as first
notice of other hot stocks that come along, consider a no-risk trial

For most Americans, Memorial Day marks the end of the school year and the
beginning of summer.  So millions of families will cook out on the grill,
drink beer and watch the Indianapolis 500.  In the south, they'll swim,
and in the north, they'll wish they could.

And me, I'll be canoeing the Ipswich River with a few dozen family and
friends . . . because that's our tradition.  This trip has been going on
since the 1940's, originally in wood and canvas canoes and now in aluminum
canoes that don't mind when you scrape your way over fallen tree limbs. 
You see, the Ipswich is not a mighty torrent; it's quiet, little more than
a big stream in places.  But it floats our boats, we get to watch birds,
ducks and turtles and enjoy an electronic-free day.  And as long as it
doesn't rain, it's great fun.

Here's hoping you, too, get to spend the day in the company of family and
friends, and that in the midst of the festivities, you find a minute to
remember those who gave their lives for our great country.

Yours in pursuit of wisdom and wealth,
