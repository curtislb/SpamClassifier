Hello,

I'm preparing an ITP (Intend To Package) as a newbie regarding Debian=20
packaging. About the source (for the ITP) I'm not the developer and simply=
=20
reproduced the copyright I found with source code.
Could you please check the attached copyright file and its respect to Debia=
n=20
rules about license / copyright ?=20
The template of the file was created by dh_make tools and I manually comple=
ted=20
needed fields.

Note : the mentionned URL for download is not currently updated as I wait t=
o=20
open the ITP to proceed with it.

Many thanks.

Regards,
Bruno
