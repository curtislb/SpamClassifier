Thanks to Frank Warmerdam and OSGEO, EPSG folks is now available 
to revise the licensing terms of their data. A preview of a new 
license is currently available on

http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/RevisedEPSGLicense

and a discussion about the terms of the license in order to have
those data if possible embedded in a program for main is viable.


CONTEXT: EPSG data are geodetic parameters, largerly used for GIS apps.

Current terms are

http://www.epsg.org/CurrentDB.html#use

libgeotiff copyright file is as follows:

License:

All the source code in this toolkit are either in the public domain, or under 
an X style license.  In any event it is all considered to be free to use
for any purpose (including commercial software).  No credit is required 
though some of the code requires that the specific source code modules 
retain their existing copyright statements.  The CSV files, and other tables
derived from the EPSG coordinate system database are also free to use.  In 
particular, no part of this code is "copyleft", nor does it imply any 
requirement for users to disclose this or their own source code.

All components not carrying their own copyright message, but distributed
with libgeotiff should be considered to be under the same license as
Niles' code.

The EPSG Tables (from which the CSV files, and .inc files are derived)
carried this statement on use of the data (from the EPSG web 
site at url http://www.epsg.org/):

Use of the Data

   1. All data pertinent to  a specific coordinate reference system must
   be copied without modification and  all related pages/records must be
   included;

   2. All components of this data  set pertinent to any given coordinate
   reference system must be  distributed together (complete distribution
   of  all  components  of  the  data set  is  preferred,  but  the  OGP
   recognises the need for a more limited distribution);

   3. The data may not be distributed for profit by any third party; and
   4. The original source [OGP] must be acknowledged.

The user assumes the entire risk as  to the accuracy and the use of this
data. The  data may be copied  and distributed subject to  the following
conditions:

INFORMATION  PROVIDED  IN THIS  DOCUMENT  IS  PROVIDED "AS  IS"  WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF  ANY KIND,  EITHER EXPRESSED OR  IMPLIED, INCLUDING  BUT NOT
LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES  OF MERCHANTABILITY AND/OR FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

With regard  to (3) above, the  data may be included  within proprietary
applications distributed on a commercial basis when the commerciality is
based on  application functionality and not  on a value ascribed  to the
freely-distributed EPSG dataset.

These conditions are currently under review.
