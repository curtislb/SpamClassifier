Do you mean the box I just posted or a different thread? 
If a different thread, disregard this as it isn't really
relevant.  The box I posted uses Freevo rather than MythTV
but afaik, the functionality of the two apps is similar. 
Freevo is more of a set-top frontend though which supports
extensive media playback options through mplayer.  The
speech interface to that is custom built.  A trivial patch
mind you but custom.  I've never played with MythTV but if
it doesn't use gtk, qt or whatever the X-windows based
screenreaders use, I'm sure you could modify Myth to simply
call an external program for speech output.  That's all my
freevo patch does, runs a script with the text on
commandline.  The script then takes care of the rest,
killing any other speak scripts which happen to be running
so you can interrupt it by pressing buttons quickly and
then calling a speech synthesizer, Festival, Dectalk or the
like.
