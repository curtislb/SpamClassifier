Like all Perl quoted constructs, the pattern match
can take any delimiter you choose as long as you supply
the m explcitly, so the following are equivalent:

  /regex/
  m/regex/
  m~regex~
  m(regex)
  m<regex>

(Note that bracket-like delimiters are paired.)

Using a different delimiter from the usual slash character
removes the need to escape slashes within the regex itself,
which is what Mumia has done.


HTH,

Rob
