Hi all.
    Now that Gentoo is no longer a linux distribution that can be installed 
with speakup, I want to know what is left that can do this?  And at what 
date will 2.6.22 become Gentoo's main line kernel?  Also, is there a shot at 
someone forking a Gentoo live CD and kernel set to include speakup when the 
2.6.22 bug is fixed?  I'd do it myself, but I'm not a programmer.

I have to reinstall linux because I'm changing machines soon.  Gentoo was my 
favorite distribution ever since I began using it.  In a lot of cases, 
installing programs just...works...And I can't say that for Debian, Fedora, 
or any other distribution (don't get me started.)  So, I hope some of these 
questions can be answered.
Thanks,
Nick
