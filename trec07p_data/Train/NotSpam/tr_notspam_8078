Jerry,
this commit doesn't seem right to me.

You basically reverted some code you already committed and I changed in
3_0_25. Right now each single backend init function can cope with the
offline mode. Each one has a delayed initialization mode, so point (c)
should not be needed.

The query code should also be able to cope with offline requests, that's
the whole point of returning ID_EXPIRED, so that in case we can't really
resolve we keep it, otherwise we get the correct return.

Basically the problem of avoiding the query completely is that you also
avoid querying idmap_tdb/idmap_rid/idmap_passdb/idmap_nss. they all the
mappings and can be consulted when offline without problems.
 
The negative cache changes are fine.

Simo.
