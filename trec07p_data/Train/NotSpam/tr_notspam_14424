			<p class="storytext">This week is another week when we are on the road — if all goes as plans, we are in Arizona on Wednesday and Florida on Friday. What about Thursday? Who knows? I don't....</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Since I had down time the last few days, I tried to sort out the pictures on my computer (my memory is overloaded and it is a bit of a problem.) I found a bunch of pictures from our interview with <a href="javascript:siteSearch('Gov. Romney');"><b>Gov. Romney</b></a> and his wife in April when they were campaigning in Florida — which I don't think ever made the blog. I posted them today.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">• <a href="/photoessay/0,4644,1801,00.html"><b>Click here to check out my photo essay</b></a></p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">By the way, two of the pictures show Gov. Romney with a handy cam. If you watched our interview, you will recall that we "ambushed" the governor — after the interview we handed him the camera and asked him to interview his wife and me. In my view, he did an extraordinary job on the handy cam. The governor had fun doing it, too.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Over the long weekend I was at a party at the home of <a href="javascript:siteSearch('Joe Trippi');"><b>Joe Trippi</b></a>. I don't know Joe very well — only professionally as he appeared on various television programs over the past few years. Joe Trippi managed <a href="javascript:siteSearch('Howard Dean');"><b>Howard Dean</b></a>'s campaign for president in 2004 (and is doing Senator Edwards' this election cycle.)</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">If you are an animal lover, you will like to know that Joe and his family adopted a war-injured dog from <a href="javascript:siteSearch('Lebanon');"><b>Lebanon</b></a>. The dog was injured — badly — last summer in the war and was rescued by an American good Samaritan animal rescue group... and then Joe's family adopted the dog without seeing her and thus knowing her condition. The dog was transported from Lebanon via the good will of an American Airline (which I should give credit to and name but don't remember which one) and brought to Utah. From Utah the dog was transported to the East Coast and to the Trippi family. The dog may be maimed by war, but obviously is very much loved by Joe and his family... and the dog loves them. It is very heartwarming to see a badly injured (now healed but disfigured) dog much loved... too bad humans are not always that nice to each. Incidentally, the dog "speaks" French having been brought up in Lebanon. So if you want to give her directions, try French.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Last week we did a show on the program <a href="javascript:siteSearch('Operation Hero Miles');"><b>Operation Hero Miles</b></a>. We urged viewers to participate and donate airline frequent flyer miles for our injured soldiers families so that they can visit their injured family members at <a href="javascript:siteSearch('Walter Reed Hospital');"><b>Walter Reed Hospital</b></a>. The participating airlines played a game — they matched donations this weekend. Well? Many of you did donate miles... check out the e-mails below (and it is not too late to donate miles... you can always donate miles even though the airline matching game is over.)</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">The e-mails:</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext"><strong>E-mail No. 1</strong></p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Hey, G.<br />
I checked my miles only have a measly 1,180, but I will donate all of them to the cause… wish I had more.<br />
<em>Vangy</em></p> 
		
			<p class="storytext"><strong>E-mail No. 2</strong></p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Please thank Greta for all she is doing to promote the donation of Frequent Flyer Miles to the Hero Miles program.<br />
There is one error in the printed transcript. The correct e-mail address should be <a href="http://www.fisherhouse.org/" target="_blank">www.fisherhouse.org</a> and not <a href="http://www.fisherhouseinc.org/" target="_blank">www.fisherhouseinc.org</a>. The latter e-mail address is for the three Fisher Houses located at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas. The <a href="http://www.fisherhouse.org/" target="_blank">www.fisherhouse.org</a> website is Fisher House Foundation, Inc., and from our Web site, navigate to "Hero Miles," then to a specific airline. Thank you.<br />
Sincerely,<br />

			<p class="storytext">Greta,<br />
Great program. Following your lead, I just went to: <a href="http://www.fisherhouse.org/" target="_blank">www.fisherhouse.org</a> and donated 20,000 miles, which count as 40,000 miles since the airlines are doubling the miles this weekend. Everybody should do the same. Our soldiers and families are making heroic sacrifices. Small gestures like these are the least we can do.<br />
All the best,<br />

I was on a long drive last Thursday night and heard your program on XM Radio regarding the Hero Miles Donation program… you struck a cord in my heart and I decided that I too need to help out. I just completed donating 100,000 Northwest miles to the Fisher House Foundation. I am especially pleased that this donation will be matched by Northwest Airlines during this Memorial Day celebration. Keep up the good work and continue to spread the word about donating miles, you set a good example for me to follow…THANKS.<br />
P.S. Loved Ozzy too!<br />

Saw the matching information on your web site and donated 25,000 Delta Skymiles today. It made our Memorial Day a bit more special.<br />

I tried to donate the few miles I have (4409), but discovered that you must donate in 1000 increments and a minimum of 5000. I just do not fly enough to accumulate miles. I think the airlines should not have any minimums to donate miles to any charity. Mine are with Northwest. What do you think?<br />

			<p class="storytext"><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Airlines, what about it? What about getting rid of minimum numbers?</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext"><strong>E-mail No. 7</strong></p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Thank you Greta for enlightening me on how I can directly help our service men! I donated miles from my accounts at AirTran, Delta, AA and UA. I really enjoy your program, I think you do a fabulous job, you always come up with interesting stories. My family is spread out across the county and when I get together with them, we have lively conversations on stories you are covering, i.e. we agree or disagree with your opinion! LOL Thanks for enlightening me on many subjects.<br />

			<p class="storytext">Hello Greta,<br />
Thanks for mentioning this weekend's Hero Miles match. I found 244,640 miles to donate — and just finished doing so. With the airlines' matches, that's almost one half million miles! Keep up the good work,<br />
