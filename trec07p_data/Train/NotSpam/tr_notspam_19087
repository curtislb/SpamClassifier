Subject: Hash Key is a Null Value
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
X-OriginalArrivalTime: 14 Jun 2007 10:29:54.0556 (UTC) FILETIME=[F2BE93C0:01C7AE6E]

I'm building a hash using values from a database backend to an application we
use in house.  The application has a field which contains a customer name.  This
values is supposed to be set by the person handling the work but sometimes
doesn't get done.  This leaves a NULL value in the database which, in turn,
leaves me with a null key in my hash.

I've tried resetting it by assigning the value to another key so I can delete
the element but so far nothing has worked.  I've tried to access it with
$hash{}, $hash{""}, and $hash{''}.  None of these will allow me to access the data.

I could probably reassign it through more complicated means but that would
require creating objects and accessing methods I'm not familiar with.  If anyone
knows an easier way to access a null key I'd appreciate hearing it.

Thanks
Mathew
