I am stuck on 5.8.0 at the moment due to compatability issues with some
database schema release management tools we use.

Assuming I can update to ActivePerl 5.8.8.820, if I set an alarm in one
forked process (thread?) before calling sysread() or sleep() on Win32,
will the same process receive the wakeup? Can I also send it a signal to
wake it up from another process? For the next step in this project I
have to split send and receive into two threads in order to handle a
full duplex connection. The ACK/NAK can be embedded anywhere in the
incoming data stream.
