SatCon to present MicroGrid paper at the 2007 Electricity Storage
Association Meeting




BOSTON, May 24, 2007 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- SatCon Technology Corporation(R)
(Nasdaq CM: SATC), a developer and supplier of power management and
system architecture solutions for the alternative energy and distributed
power markets, today announced that it will be presenting at the
Electricity Storage Association Annual Meeting being held in Boston, MA
this week. The title of the presentation is "Utility-Interactive
Uninterruptible Power System for Private "Island" Grids". 

"Alternative Energy Sources are not generally suitable as stand alone
power sources, operating independent of the Grid, but need to be matched
to an appropriate form of energy storage before they can act to power an
Island or MicroGrid. The storage is used to level the load for sources
that are constant such as Fuel Cells, or to store excess energy and time
shift the energy for intermittent or time-varying sources such as PV or
Wind," said Dr. Leo Casey, SatCon's Chief Technology Officer. "We have a
long history of powering private Islands or MicroGrids, and connecting
and disconnecting these islands from the Grid. Our continued work
combines that background with our experience with Utility scale
Alternative Energy and Energy Storage Inverters and Systems and our
background in large facility backup power systems to enhance security
and reliability of the MicroGrid and to improve power quality. The
result is the ability to transform Distributed Generation sources which
are of limited value in Grid outage situations, by coupling them with
appropriate storage and transfer switching, to create robust MicroGrids
based on Alternative Energy sources that can separate from the Grid and
operate as a stable power island."
