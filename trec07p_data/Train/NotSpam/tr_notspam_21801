     Well, I get half-way through the Slackware install and then try to 
install to the root partition and that's as far as I can go. <sighs>  Is 
there a way to install slackware that bypasses all the stupid menus?  Or 
is there a way how I can better identify what is selected?  I know about 
the "cursoring up is better" part, as what you're on is said first, 
followed by what you've left.  Tried turning cursor tracking on and off, 
too.  The docs say just to type in the kernal's name: speakup.s  Maybe 
opening another terminal and finding...damn I hate menus.  Give me an 
alias, any day. <laughs>  Oh well.  Just ranting

         Michael
