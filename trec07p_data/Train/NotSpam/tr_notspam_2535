Thanks, John.  I'll check in a fix for this in qooxdoo's trunk, and when
qooxdoo 0.7 is released and I upgrade SWAT to use it, we'll have the fix here
too.

The comment you found in the code still applies, but I'm now tracking the
first state in a separate variable rather than depending on finding it as the
first value discovered by iterating the object properties.

Cheers,

Derrell
