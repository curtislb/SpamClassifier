Hi Tom,

Thanks for your reply. (I am a big fan)

In fact I did read that FAQ. But missed the point actually. I made up
in my mind that warnings should be cured at all times, not ignored/
suppressed.  But it makes sense turning off warning for that block.
And it solves my problem.

I was thinking of going for more complex solutions. Like deleting the
hidden fields and replacing them with textboxes with value, then
submitting the form. :-? But my head is healthy again.
