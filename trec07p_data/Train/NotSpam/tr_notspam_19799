For logistic regression you can also use Design's lrm function which 
gives you more options.

If by posthoc you mean that the covariate is measured after baseline, it 
is difficult to get an interpretable analysis.

You mean regression coefficient on the log odds ratio scale.  This is 
easy to do with the contrast( ) function in Design.  Do ?contrast.Design 
for details and examples.

contrast( ) is for contrasts (differences).  Sounds like you want 
predicted values.  Do ?predict  ?predict.lrm  ?predict.Design.  Also do 
?gendata which will generate a data frame for getting predictors, with 
unspecified predictors set to reference values such as medians.
