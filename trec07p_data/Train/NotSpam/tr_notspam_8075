We would like to collect a number of quotes from people about the
recent Brazilian CL, which we can then give to reporters who cover
this topic in the next week or so.  Anything is fine, including
quotes from people who opposed the decision (like Merck or many of
the pro-company groups they support).... but mostly we are keen to
get quotes from the public health community that favors such
actions.    If you could send me a note with your quote, we will
include yours.  Jamie
