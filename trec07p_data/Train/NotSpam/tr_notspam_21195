Sebastian,

You should be able to, but I don't know how to do it with lattice.  In
ggplot (http://had.co.nz/ggplot2) you would do it as follows:

ggplot(mydata, aes(x = time, y = value, colour=model)) +
geom_point(subset(data, model != "observed")) +
geom_line((subset(data, model == "observed")) +
facet_grid(. ~ individuals)

or if you only wanted the models coloured:

ggplot(mydata, aes(x = time, y = value)) +
geom_point(subset(data, model != "observed"), aes(colour=model)) +
geom_line((subset(data, model == "observed")) +
facet_grid(. ~ individuals)

Although the way the panels are arranged is probably suboptimal if you
have many individuals.  It's something I plan to fix in the future, so
that  + facet_wrap(individuals) would give you a display like lattice
does.
