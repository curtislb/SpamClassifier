Yes sez me :)

I think that it's a mistake to separate the set of system calls used  
to alter your credentials, because switching to a credential is a  
logically single operation that should pass or fail as a whole. In  
SAMBA_4_0, the credential switch is done in a single function,  
set_unix_security(). This seems to me to be the right way to do it.

I originally had this, but I didn't like how this interacted with  
HAVE_SETGROUPS and HAVE_BROKEN_SETGROUPS. I thought it best to  
maintain the existing convention that the sys_* wrappers should call  
the thing they wrap as precisely as possibly.

I'll work up a patch containing just the modified sys_setgroups and  
post that before committing anything.
