Lou Dobbs Tonight
Tuesday May 8, 2007

Tonight, 6 men charged with planning to attack U.S. soldiers at
Fort Dix in New Jersey. Three of the terrorist suspects were in
this country illegally.

The House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship,
Refugees, Border Security, and International Law is holding a
hearing today on the "Role of Family-Based Immigration in the
U.S. Immigration System". We’ll have a full report on the
proposed a merit-based system for immigrants to earn U.S.
citizenship

The Senate struck down a bill that would have allowed
individuals to import cheaper drugs from foreign countries.
Critics of the bill are concerned imported drugs can not be
adequately regulated and could be at risk of contamination.
We’ll have a full examination of the cross border drug wars.

Oil profits are at record highs while middle class Americans
struggle to fill up their tanks. Gas prices are as high as
$4.00 a gallon in some parts of the country while the national
average reached $3.07.	We’ll have a full report on how
legislators, if any, are addressing this problem.

Tens of millions of Americans consider themselves religious,
and more than ever, they are practicing their faith outside
their places of worship and bringing it with them to their
office. But courts are siding with employers, saying workers
should get equal treatment in the workplace and not special
treatment. The latest court ruling found that a pharmacy
employee could not use his religion to get out of his duties
working in the pharmacy. We’ll be taking a look at just how
many Americans are religious, and the conflicts it creates in
the workplace.

Many Catholic Church leaders, including Cardinal Roger Mahony
of Los Angeles, have been outspoken advocates of some type of
amnesty for illegal aliens.  However, there is discord among
Catholics on the issue of illegal immigration and how Catholic
Church doctrine should be interpreted. We’ll have more on that
tonight.

Three of the nation's best radio talk show hosts join Lou: Joe
Madison of WOL in Washington, Laura Flanders of Air America in
New York and Spie McIntyre of KABC in Los Angeles.

latest commentary on why May Day was a peculiar choice for
illegal immigration demonstrations.

Lou Dobbs lays out his manifesto to save the middle class in
his new book, “War on the Middle Class: How the Government, Big
Business, and Special Interest Groups Are Waging War on the
American Dream and How to Fight Back.” War on the Middle Class
is now on sale in bookstores near you and on Amazon.com and
BarnesandNoble.com.
