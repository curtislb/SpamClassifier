Remember the offer Greg Kroah-Hartman made earlier this year, to get
[0]Linux drivers written for free for any company that wanted them? Now
an anonymous reader points us to an article up on linuxworld with an
[1]update to this program. Greg K-H, who leads the development of several
kernel subsystems including USB and PCI, admits that the January offer
was a bit of "marketing hype" — but says it has brought companies and
developers together anyway. Twelve companies have said "yes please," one
driver is already in the kernel, and five more are in the pipeline.

Pontifex minimus writes "Music royalty collection group SoundExchange has
[0]offered an olive branch to small webcasters. They are willing to delay
the [1]exorbitant new rates set by the Copyright Royalty Board until 2010
for small webcasters in hopes that they can keep Congress from passing
the [2]Internet Radio Equality Act. Larger outfits, like Live365 and
Pandora would not be affected and would have to pay the new rates.
'"Although the rates revised by the CRB are fair and based on the value
of music in the marketplace, there's a sense in the music community and
in Congress that small webcasters need more time to develop their
businesses," said John Simson, executive director of SoundExchange.'
SaveNetRadio rejected SoundExchange's offer, saying that it 'throws large
webcasters under the bus.'"

finally been mapped — by a robotic submarine whose descendants may one
day swim on one of Jupiter's moons. The last attempt to find the bottom
resulted in the SCUBA diving depth record and the death of a [1]diving

10m from the floor. The sub's mapping also indicated that the sinkhole,
which is over 300m deep, could connect to even deeper caves."

[0]qu1j0t3 writes "Business 2.0 reports that two MacBook owners have
filed [1]a class action lawsuit charging Apple with deceptive advertising,
as well as misrepresentation and unfair competition over the use of the
phrase 'millions of colors' to describe the capability of the LCD
displays in MacBook and MacBook Pro computers. The article likens the
complaint to an an angry forum thread, and is more than a little bit
skeptical of the plaintiff's motives. Perhaps it's their uncanny
attention to detail. From the filing: 'The reality is that
notwithstanding Apple's misrepresentations and suggestions that its
MacBook and MacBook Pro display millions of colors, the displays are only
capable of displaying the illusion of millions of colors through the use
of a software technique referred to as dithering, which causes nearby
pixels on the display to use slightly varying shades of colors that trick
the human eye into perceiving the desired color even though it is not
truly that color.'

'Mongzilla', a high school english teacher. The student is arguing he had
First Amendment rights to publish the video, though it was filmed without
permission in the classroom. 'Kent School District lawyer Charles Lind
says the suspension had nothing to do with online criticism of the
teacher. Rather, it was punishment for the disruption created by the
students secreting a video camera into Joyce Mong's class and dancing in
a mocking, disrespectful manner while her back was turned. "It's quite
clear that the district is talking about conduct in the classroom and not
the videotape," Lind said.'"

American and Irish researchers that have discovered that some [1]female

Their report concludes that sharks can reproduce asexually through the
process known as [2]parthenogenesis (the growth and development of an
embryo or seed without fertilization by a male). Scientists started
investigating after a female hammerhead shark was mysteriously born at
Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo in a tank that housed 3 female sharks. It was
originally thought one had stored sperm from a male shark before
fertilizing an egg. However, baby shark's genetic makeup perfectly
matched one of the females in the tank, with no sign of a male parent."

year felony charge and a $10,000 fine but apparently got off lucky and
received only a $400 fine and 40 hours of community service because he
was a first time offender. 'it seems few in the village of Sparta, Mich.,
were aware that using an unsecured Wi-Fi connection without the owner's
permission--a practice known as piggybacking--was a felony. Each day
around lunch time, Sam Peterson would drive to the Union Street Cafe,
park his car and--without actually entering the coffee shop--check his
e-mail and surf the Net. His ritual raised the suspicions of Police Chief
Andrew Milanowski, who approached him and asked what he was doing.
Peterson, probably not realizing that his actions constituted a crime,
freely admitted what he was doing ... [the officer] didn't immediately
cite or arrest Peterson, mostly because he wasn't certain a crime had
been committed.'"

teflonscout writes "When I think of bulletproof vests, the first word
that comes to mind is Kevlar. Wired is running a story on Dynema SB61, a
[0]bulletproof material that is made of polyethylene. It is a higher
grade of the plastic found in Tupperware. The story also mentions the
recall of Second Chance bulletproof vests that were made from Zylon, a
material that degraded slowly when exposed to moisture. At least one
police officer [1]was injured when a bullet penetrated his Zylon vest.
Polyethylene is impervious to moisture. The first vests made from this
new material are 5mm thick and can [2]stop a 9mm bullet traveling at 1777
feet per second, which is slightly better than other top of the line
vests."

[0]cgjherr writes "Ah, the technology history book, normally I'm not a
fan. The writing is aloof and dry. The topics are vague, the history
misinterpreted, and the lessons presented too vague to be applicable. And
don't get me started on the illustrations, which are all too often
pyramids with the authors perched at the top looking down on the lowly
reader at the base. Thankfully, this book, "the myths of innovation"
breaks all of these rules. It's an engaging, fun and quick read. The
history is interesting, and the lessons presented are practical. I
particularly like the author's tone. It's witty and light. Which makes
this a very fast read, one that leaves you wanting even more by the end."

[0]NIMBY writes "An interesting editorial over at PC Perspective looks at
the changing status between modern [1]game developers and companies like
AMD and NVIDIA that depend on their work to show off their products.
Recently, both AMD and NVIDIA separately helped in releasing DX10
benchmarks based on upcoming games that show the other hardware vendor in
a negative light. But what went on behind the scenes? Can any
collaboration these companies use actually be trusted by reviewers and
the public to base a purchasing decision on? The author thinks the one
source of resolution to this is have honest game developers take a stance
for the gamer."

long delays during development now seem over. Sling Media has finally
released version 1.0 of their software for Mac OSX. This means that,
after buying and installing the Slingbox, Mac users can 'sling' their
home cable and satellite signals to themselves at the airport, or in a
café hotspot, or over their office computers. The article on
SlingCommunity.com gives the details of the software's development — from
last year's [2]much-discussed beta to today's v1.0. Screenshots show how
a standard-looking "[3]TV remote," displayed onscreen, allows the Mac
users to change channels or browse Tivo recordings over the Internet,
many miles from their living rooms."

An anonymous reader writes to mention that Jack Thompson, in his latest
bout of zealotry, has [0]set his sights on Microsoft for their recent
release of Halo 3. GameAlmighty has posted the letter to Bill Gates.
"Here's the deal, Mr. Gates: Either Microsoft undertakes dramatic, real
steps, through its marketing, wholesale, and retail operations to assure
that Halo 3 is not sold, via the Internet and in stores, directly to
anyone under 17, or I shall proceed to make sure that Microsoft is held
to that standard by appropriate legal means. I have done that before
successfully as to Best Buy, and I shall do so again as to Microsoft and
all retailers of Halo 3."
