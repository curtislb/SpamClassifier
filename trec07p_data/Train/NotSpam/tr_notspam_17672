After my venerable linksys befw11s4 started losing it this past weekend, I 
received just yesterday my new linksys WRT54GL, which came highly 
recommended, and so far, I am quite impressed. The latest firmware is 
4.30.9, but I understand that there's lots of GPL tweaks and such that are 
available for this router.
