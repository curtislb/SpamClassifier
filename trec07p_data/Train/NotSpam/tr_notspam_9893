You are confusing binary packages available for a version of R for 
Windows, and source packages.  But 'stats4' is not on CRAN.

"grid", "splines" "stats4", "tcltk" and "tools" come with R.  Your 
selection test is wrong (you want to test for NA Priority).
Something like

need <- as.vector(ip[is.na(ip[, "Priority"]), 1])

"graph" and "RBGL" are on Bioconductor, and using 'Select repositories' 
from the menu to add that repoository would have found them.

For "Design", "dynamicGraph", "ggplot", "ref" see

http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/contrib/checkSummaryWin.html

CRAN does not distribute binary versions of packages that fail their 
tests.

AFAIK tapiR has been withdrawn from CRAN.

Not at all.

You are not looking at the right list on that website.

It _is_ in the value returned by available.packages(), and in that 
returned by installed.packages() (but dependencies can change with later 
versions than those you have installed).
