In my experience, archiving offices tend to be rather inflexible when it
comes to licensing.

I have two questions:

1. Do you have to archive with your institution? If this is a
requirement for your graduation, then do whatever you need to do and
forget about it, but choose the less restrictive option, and then
self-archive somewhere online (SSRN or with other self-archiving method).
2. If you don't need to archive with them, then self-archive under a CC
licence.

Regards,

Andres
