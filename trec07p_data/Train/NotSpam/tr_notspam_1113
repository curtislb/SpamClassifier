Thanks!  Any thoughts are greatly appreciated.

True, I should really improve this.

The patch doesn't change that.  Previously, the static library was built 
at F<blib/lib/libparrot.lib>, the import library at F<libparrot.lib> (no 
blib/lib here!).  Now it's F<blib/lib/libparrot.lib> and 
F<blib/lib/parrot.lib>, respectively.

11.04.2007  20:58        19.226.530 libparrot.lib
11.04.2007  19:43         2.685.438 parrot.lib

Both libraries get built during make, but I'm not sure if libparrot is 
usable.  Are we talking about a statically linked parrot.exe?  I can 
look into this if you like.
