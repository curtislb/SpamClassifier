Hi all:  Since we're on the subject of thinkpads, I've got a bit of a 
poser too.  First, I've tried a few different distros on this critter, 
and here's the thing...
I can get grml to boot, but, it doesn't pick up the doubletalk when I 
specify it to the grml prompt, however, when I am finished booting, and 
echo it to /proc/speakup/synth_name, it comes right up.
So, I thought I'd try it with slackware, and no dice, even after the 
boot process completes, I know it completes because I can run the eject 
command and it releases the cd from the drive.  Is this a bios problem, 
or is there someplace else I should be looking?  By the way, I did get 
the 6.1 ubuntu to work too, but I like my text console better just 
now... any help would be most welcome, as I'm running xp right now, I 
kinda' liked it when I found out that xp won't even see a linux 
partition so now I know that when I reinstall it on this beast I can do 
a duel-boot on it and use it to test the linux version of Audio Quake 
and still play my winders-based games too...
Thanks much!
