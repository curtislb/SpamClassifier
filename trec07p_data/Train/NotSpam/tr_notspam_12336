Mimir,

yes, it's very handy if you are a malicious hacker!

Imagine the admin has a ftp upload area, and cd's to that
directory. He wants to see if anyone is connected to that area with
"smbstatus". The attacker uploads util.js and hey presto the attacker
has just got the admin to run his code inside smbstatus, as root.

Same applies to someones home directory.

There is a very good reason why "." is not in $PATH on unix by
default :-)

Please revert this one. It's a major security hole.

Cheers, Tridge
