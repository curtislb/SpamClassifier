Where would you look for such a product?  How would a seller of such a 
product find you without offending you with his crass commercialism?

I haven't tried etch on my 600E, but to make sound work under Fedora 
Core 2 I had to put these in /etc/modprobe.conf:
    alias snd-slot-0 snd-cs4236
    alias snd-card-0 snd-cs4236
    options snd-cs4236 port=0x530 irq=5 dma1=1 dma2=0 mpu_port=0x330 
mpu_irq=7 cport=0x538 fm_port=0x388 isapnp=0

I haven't bothered with the modem, but ThinkWiki says there is a driver:

I'm underemployed right now and can afford to spend some time to create 
such a disk for Etch on a 600E, but I'd like to get several hundred 
dollars for such work, which means I would need to find a bunch of  
customers to share the cost.  The 600E is so old now that I doubt I 
could find enough buyers to make it worthwhile.  Also, my 600E is 
failing (which is why I bought the T23).  Only one of the RAM slots is 
still working--Fedora runs poorly with only 96 MB!

Would you be willing to take a "dumb installer" that erases your hard 
drive and installs a tuned copy of Etch?  That would require backing up 
all your personal data beforehand and restoring after.  Also, the 600E 
usually shipped with a CD-ROM drive, not DVD-ROM, which is too small 
for even the basic set of packages, so some disk-swapping would be 
needed.
