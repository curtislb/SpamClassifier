The grant of permissions is awkwardly given in the GPL FAQ:
http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl-faq.html#ModifyGPL

There's a name-change requirement, which is acceptable from a DFSG point
of view.
There are some consistency requirements for the instructions-for-use: I
didn't think hard to check whether they meet the DFSG.
There's a requirement to *not* mention GNU in those instructions, which
does *not* look DFSG-free: I cannot mention GNU, not even in a
descriptive way and/or clarifying that I claim no endorsement by or
affiliation with the GNU Project!
Moreover, you _must_ purge the preamble: there's no permission to modify
it, in any way; there's not even the permission to keep it bundled with
your license derived from the GPL!  This means that the GPL preamble
does *not* comply with the DFSG.

The requirement to change the name of the derived license is fine, as I
stated.
On the other hand, the requirement to not mention GNU is not a default
trademark restriction!  And I don't think it's DFSG-free.

Not necessarily: I could create a modified version of the GPL preamble
that is not misrepresented as the opinion of RMS, but is clearly
presented as *my* own opinion.  Nothing wrong would be going on, in that
case: my preamble would be derived from the GPL preamble (as far as
copyright is concerned), but would be clearly marked as *my* personal
modified version of the GPL preamble and should be therefore regarded as
*my* opinion, not (necessarily) RMS' one.

But the FSF does not permit this scenario.
They use copyright law to forbid it.
It's a non-free restriction.

I disagree.
