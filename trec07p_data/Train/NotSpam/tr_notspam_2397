Right.  Make sure the whole critical path is 16-bit 565.

Correct; about the only thing you can do here is use create_similar() on
the xlib _window_ surface, draw your 24bpp image surface to that, and
cache the 565 xlib surface for all further drawing.  Note that you will
_not_ get alpha because the surface is 565.

I looked at this last night.  The current python bindings don't have
support for creating arbitrary Xlib surfaces.  I don't believe you can
call the equivalent of cairo_xlib_surface_create().  The only functions
that are bound for Xlib surfaces are get_depth(), get_height(), and
get_width().  So before we can actually create arbitrary Xlib surfaces
in whatever Xlib visual we want, we'd have to fix up the pycairo
bindings to support that.

I'm not even sure how to start passing in Xlib Display or Visual
structures given that there isn't any Xlib python binding to my
knowledge.  Perhaps PyGTK would have some ideas on how to do this in
it's X11 backend, but I think it only deals with xids and wraps most of
Xlib.

It's pretty easy given a GTK widget.  Embed a GtkDrawingArea subclass in
your window, and then override the 'expose' method of the drawing area
widget.

Again, ensure that _any_ surfaces you use in your critical paths are
565.  If anything is not 565, you'll be subject to Xlib having to smash
an 888 pixmap down to 565, and that's not very fast, even with MMX.

Also, pycairo may need to be fixed before you can create arbitrary Xlib
surfaces of your desired depth, without using create_similar.  But in
your case, you can probably just use create_similar since you don't need
anything except 565.
