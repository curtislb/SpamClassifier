I don't see the relevance of this. If you're referring to the
GPL-specific exception for source code (that components of the target
system don't need to be distributed with source), that doesn't seem to
be relevant at all: this is about the license terms for a text, not
whether source code must be distributed.

When hardware is something distributable by the Debian project as part
of Debian, then this might be relevant; it isn't an issue with current
technology.

License texts *are* distributed by Debian, now, under terms that are
non-free. This behaviour doesn't match the Social Contract.

Why would lawyers ask us that, and why are their questions about the
Social Contract germane here? It's not a legally-binding document.

I would think thazt *only* things which are immediately obvious are
exempt from the need for clarification. Anything else needs to at
least be considered on its merits, and not dismissed because it's "not
immediately obvious".

I don't see how that's at all true. Contrariwise, I would hope you
agree that a document that says "we will always do this, and never do
that", but which is routinely violated in practice, is one that
readers will not take seriously.
