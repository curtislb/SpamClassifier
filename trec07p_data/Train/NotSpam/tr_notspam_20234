Ok, in the past hour there have been some real revelations and learning on
my part.  I have made some people scratch their heads and then go
"OOOOH!!!!".  In the echo of their "OOOOH!!!!" was the explanation of my
issue.  What I didn't realize, was that when you are doing a test on a
variable that contains a file name (a file test that is), you must first
CLOSE THE FILE HANDLE!  Talk about having to bang your head on the desk.   I
was closing the filehandle, but doing it after all was said and done with
the loop.  (sorry for that little missing detail).  I will make sure next
time to post the entire script so you can see everything that is going on.

Thank you for the response Paul, I really appreciate it!!

BTW, the chomp is no longer in the script as it didn't seem to resolve this
issue after my writing.  Not sure why, but that is an issue I don't have
time to delve into right now.  Its probably because it shouldn't have
resolved it to begin with and something was more than likely modified in the
process of debugging and also removed before I had the chance to see it and
test it.

Regards,

Jeff Kirkland
