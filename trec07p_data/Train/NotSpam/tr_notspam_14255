I agree with you Brian. I have been posting on this list for around four
years, and rarely have I seen 'help' that is expressed with such vitriol
as Paul's has been. When Casey West envisaged perl.beginners back in 2001
his intent was to avoid this very attitude of muscle-flexing. He writes:

~ It seems that the very thing we want to have happen, adding number to our 
~ ranks, is the first thing we fight against when beginners show their 
~ faces. Wielding our swords of "RTFM" and shields of "killfile" we smite 
~ the very programmers that will carry this language into the future. I 
~ have a co-worker who is known for saying, "It's a good thing Perl is so 
~ powerful and cool, it barely makes up for the collective, childish 
~ 'elitism' displayed by its community." Collectively, this is a sad truth.

I hope you will persist in posting requests for, and perhaps offers of
help. All group members are valuable and I look forward to your input.

Rob
