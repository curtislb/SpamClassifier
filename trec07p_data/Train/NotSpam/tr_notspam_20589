<B>TONIGHT ON SHOWBIZ TONIGHT - CNN HEADLINE PRIME 11pm
ET/PT</B>

<B>ANNA NICOLE SMITH SHOCKER: JUDGE QUITS!</B>
Remember the "crying" judge from the Anna Nicole Smith body
battle - Larry Seidlin? Well, Showbiz Tonight has learned: he's
resigning! The stunning story of why Seidlin is stepping down
from the bench - and possibly stepping <i>in front</i> of the
camera.

<B> A REHAB REALITY CHECK!</B>
Is Britney Spears setting herself up for disaster? Will Lindsay
Lohan's rehab work this time? And are celeb rehab centers
effective? The tough questions on TV's most provocative
entertainment news show.

<b>SHOWBIZ TONIGHT’S CELEBRITY MATCHMAKING!</B>
Matthew McConaughey was just named People magazine's hottest
bachelor. But who should he be dating? Same question for
Jennifer Aniston and George Clooney. Tonight, we’re playing
cupid – and serving up some summer lovin’, as the matchmakers
to the stars pick some sizzling celebrity setups!

<b>THE DARK SIDE OF COMEDY</B>
Robin Williams, Roseanne Barr, Jim Carrey – all talented
comedians linked by much more than laughs. They have also
battled depression.  The life of a comedian has its extreme
highs and lows -- but tonight, Showbiz Tonight has to ask: Do
the laughs actually hide a more serious problem?

<b>SHOWBIZ TONIGHT QUESTION OF THE DAY:</b>
Britney Spears out in clubs: A recipe for disaster?
