Hello sm1lies,

We thought you would like to know that we have three component development projects currently open for registration for a total prize pool of $7,200.

* Java Diagram UML Class Elements ($2,000)
* Custom Java Time Tracker Fixed Billing Entry ($2,000) 
* Java Chat Message Pool ($800)

The registration issues affecting Time Tracker Fixed Billing Entry have been fixed, and the registration timeline was extended as well.

Good luck!
