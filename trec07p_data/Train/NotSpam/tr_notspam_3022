Hello all,

    I have a hash anonymous hashes.  The data stream that I am getting 
is actually from an SQL query a users ID, like "jones12a3", a subsystem 
name associated to that ID, like "Lotus Notes", and a number, "3" tied 
to the number of subsystems changes that that user has implemented.  so 
that stream comes at me like...

jones12a3, lotusnotes, 3, jones12a3, unix, 4, jones12a3, linux, 13, 
smith18a1, unix, 5, smith, ... etc...

so i use the ID as the key in the first hash, and the value is a new 
anonymous hash whos key is the subsystem name, and value is the number 
of changes...

so i have:
jones12a3 => {lotusnotes => 3 unix => 4 linux => 13}
smith18a1 => {unix => 5}

and so forth..

i have used Data::Dumper to see the actual output and it is as 
expected... but i want to use the data in that anonymous hash and 
iterate through it getting a count and such..

i can't seem to figure out how to get to it once it is in there...

do i dereference it somehow?  they are anonymous hashes, so they have no 
name...

sorry for the lack of real information here but the actual code is at 
work, and i am emailing this from home... but hopefully someone here has 
run into this before... Thanks in advance!

CK
