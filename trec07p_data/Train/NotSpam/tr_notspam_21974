     Hi again all,

     Well, Slack11 is working great.  The BSD init setup is strange 
after working in System V.  I have a really strange problem.  I saved a 
few of my own aliases in a file called .aliases, and then made and added 
the lines to .bashrc:

echo 3 > /proc/speakup/rate
source ~/.aliases

     It didn't work, so I unaliased all of my aliases and tried again. 
That didn't work either, so I deleted every single file in the home 
directory, deleted every alias, logged out, logged vack in, and guess 
what?  The stoopid default aliases were back!  wtf?  Is Windows haunting 
my Linux drive now?  Anyone know how to get rid of the default aliases 
and add my own?  .bashrc doesn't seem to work in Slack for some odd 
reason, and yeah, I'm using bash.  Ran Debian for over two years, so I'm 
not TOO stupid. <laughs>  Thank the gods I'm running sendmail.  Best 
news I've had since January.  I wonder if there's a way to generate an 
installed  package list.

         Michael
