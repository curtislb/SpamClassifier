TONIGHT ON THE CBS EVENING NEWS
<http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/eveningnews/main3420.shtml>=20

Here is an early preview of what Awe are planning for tonight's CBS
EVENING NEWS from Anchor and Managing Editor, Katie Couric...=20

Hi everyone,=20

Late breaking news on Capitol Hill tonight as Congress prepares to send
President Bush legislation that would call for the withdrawal of troops
to start this October. After days of harsh words between the
administration and the Democratic leadership about the vote, the White
House remains steadfast about President Bush's plans to veto this
legislation. Sharyl Attkisson will report.=20

David Martin will give a Reality Check on the state of the troop surge
in Iraq, how it's working and where funds are needed most on the ground
there.=20

Next, Bob Orr will have an update on a story he broke for CBS News about
the case of a man who calls himself "The Bishop." This morning, federal
authorities arrested a man suspected of sending threatening letters and
two dud pipe bombs. We'll have more details on the case and the arrest.=20

When John McCain started campaigning months ago for the Republican
nomination, he was the presumed front-runner. Now that he has trailed
Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney in polls, he's attempting to breathe life
into his campaign. Today, McCain formally declared his candidacy, and
Jim Axelrod will have the full story.=20

Residents of Eagle Pass, Texas, say they can't remember the last time a
tornado struck their area. But the one that came to town yesterday was a
monster - destroying two schools, killing seven people and damaging more
than 20 homes. Elsewhere, flooding and high winds took their toll. Hari
Sreenivasan will survey the damage.=20

Ask a kid their favorite food, and you're likely to hear chips, cookies
or other sugar- or fat-loaded snacks. What happens when a school reforms
the way kids eat? Nancy Cordes will show you.=20

Finally, we'll tell you about what could be a planet a lot like Earth.
It seems to be roughly the same temperature and size, and may even have
water. The hitch: it is 120 trillion miles away. Sandra Hughes will have
more.=20

I hope you'll join us.=20

________________________________


THURSDAY MORNING ON THE EARLY SHOW
<http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/earlyshow/main500202.shtml>=20

Harry Smith, Hannah Storm, Julie Chen and Tracy Smith anchor THE EARLY
SHOW from New York. Dave Price will bring us the weather. Russ Mitchell
is off.=20

Along with the top news of the day, we will also have the following
stories:=20

A NEW TREND IN JOB HUNTING: Applying for a job via video? It may not be
as crazy as it sounds. Video resumes are a relatively new tool, but
recent surveys found that a surprisingly high number of managers would
consider viewing them if an applicant did submit one. Video resumes
could be of great value in an increasingly competitive working world.
CBS News Science and Technology Correspondent Daniel Sieberg will join
us with the latest.=20

PREVENTING INJURY: SUMMER SAFETY FOR YOUR KIDS: Summer is right around
the corner and as the temperature rises, so do the risks of serious
injury to your kids. EARLY SHOW Consumer Correspondent Susan Koeppen
will join us Thursday morning with a warning about common summer hazards
for children--beginning in your own back yard.=20

PUPPY'S FIRST STEPS: THE KEY TO A WELL BEHAVED PET: A furry friend is a
welcome addition to any family. But a new puppy can challenge even the
most seasoned parents. So how can you make sure your puppy stays on the
right track? A whole-dog approach from one of the world's best
veterinary schools, Puppy's First Steps is a guide on how to raise a
well-behaved happy and healthy puppy. Animal behaviorist Dr. Nicholas
Dodman will join us Thursday morning with advice for every puppy owner.=20

MY GENERATION: MEDDLING MOMS: Ever since there's been moms...there's
been meddling! And no matter how old you get, or how wise you think you
are, a mom is always a mom. And as relationship writer Amy Kean tells
us, most moms think they know best! Kean will join us Thursday morning
with advice on how you can limit the meddling and finally get along.=20

YOUNG AT HEART: NEVER GET SICK: Everyone knows that good health is
dependent on a healthy lifestyle - proper diet, exercise and no smoking.
But according to a new article in the current issue of AARP The
Magazine, some other simple lifestyle changes can prevent illness and
keep the doctor away. Steve Slon, the editor or AARP Magazine, will join
us Thursday morning with tips you won't want to miss.=20

CSI SNEAK PEEK: Thursday night's episode of CSI features a washed-up
boxer who gets fished out of a swimming pool. In an exclusive preview
scene you won't see anywhere else, Grissom and Sara get the scoop from a
local cop at the crime scene... a mom-and-pop brothel just outside of
Sin City. Thursday morning, we'll take a sneak peek at the action.=20

WEDDING IN A WEEK: FOOD, DRINK AND CAKE TASTING: As the big day
approaches in our Wedding in a Week series, master party planner Colin
Cowie, and author of the new book Extraordinary Weddings, joins us along
with Chef Katy Sparks from Great performance for Hudson to give our
lucky couple Lisa Mayo and Stephen Wilfong a tasting of their Wedding
Menu.=20
