I'm not sure what any of this has to do with choice of venue; the only
thing choice of venue alters is your ability to stop the case in the
initial phases by advertising that venue is improper in that
jursidiction, not your ability to decide that ignoring German law is
the appropriate tactic.

They'd probably come to Belgium to get the German decision enforced,
actually. They're fairly close, after all.
