WHO marks turning point for 1 billion people
Partners commit to global action against forgotten diseases


19 APRIL 2007 | GENEVA -- WHO and key partners are meeting on Thursday
and Friday to demonstrate an unprecedented commitment to combat the
so-called neglected tropical diseases. This commitment comes from
political leaders and ministries of health in affected countries, from
development agencies and banks, foundations, scientists, and some of
the world’s leading pharmaceutical companies.

Most of the neglected diseases are caused by parasites that thrive in
impoverished settings, where water supply, sanitation, and housing are
poor. Apart from this strong link to poverty, the diseases form a group
because they permanently deform and disable large numbers of poor
people, trapping them in poverty.

Worldwide, an estimated 1 billion people – one sixth of the world’s
population – are affected by one or more of these diseases. Recent
evidence of their severe impact on socioeconomic development has
spurred unprecedented commitment to reduce this burden. Control of
these diseases is now considered part of the global drive to reduce
poverty.

“This event marks a turning point in the long and notorious history of
some of humanity’s oldest diseases,” the WHO Director-General, Dr
Margaret Chan, said in her opening address. “The burden imposed by
these diseases, measured in terms of human misery alone, is
unacceptable. We are committed to take action.”

Safe and effective drugs available

Most of these diseases were once present across a wide area, but
gradually disappeared as standards of living and hygiene improved. The
availability of safe and effective drugs in large quantities makes it
possible, for the first time in history, to take immediate action
against these diseases, without having to wait for gradual
improvements.

The Vice President of the United Republic of Tanzania, His Excellency
Dr Ali Mohamed Shein, told the meeting, "I would like to emphasize that
all these diseases are not neglected, in any way, by the developing
countries… We, in Tanzania, for example have recognized, since the dawn
of independence, that health status and health service delivery are the
core of socio-economic development. We have waged a protracted war
against all diseases, which are regarded as a hindrance to development,
alongside poverty and ignorance."

As these diseases affect large numbers of very poor people, the
decision by industry to supply drugs for prevention or treatment at low
or no cost has also been decisive in turning the tide.

During the meeting on Thursday, Dr Chan and Merck KGaA's Executive
Board Member, Mr Elmar Schnee, signed an agreement aimed at fighting
schistosomiasis.

A donation of 200 million tablets of the drug praziquantel will be
given to WHO, with an estimated market value of US$80 million. The
agreement could potentially protect millions of children from
schistosomiasis, a parasitic worm disease which affects about 180
million people, most of them children in Africa. The 10-year
collaboration will boost WHO's schistosomiasis treatment efforts
targeted at least developed countries where the disease is highly
endemic.

"This disease is one of the biggest health risks to African children
after malaria and this collaboration ensures the chance of a healthy
life in countries marked by diseases of poverty," said Mr Schnee.

New drug strategy

Cost-effective tools to eliminate several of the neglected tropical
diseases exist, some costing as little as 50 US cents per person. Last
year, WHO launched a new strategy to improve the simultaneous control
of several of the diseases.

With this Preventive Chemotherapy (PCT) Strategy, a combination of
three vital drugs is used to prevent and control a range of parasitic
worm diseases all at one time. WHO had secured access to two drugs
crucial to the PCT strategy, albendazole and ivermectin. With the
agreement signed today, WHO has also secured praziquantel, the drug
long considered to be the strategy's "missing link".

Substantial progress has already been made in the fight to control and
eliminate many neglected tropical diseases: The number of leprosy cases
has decreased from 5.2 million in 1985 to less than 220 000 cases today
and 14.5 million people have been cured of this disease. Guinea worm
disease is set for eradication. Previously, only one disease - smallpox
- has ever been eradicated.

This agreement with Merck is the latest in a series of collaborations
with the private sector to support the control and possible elimination
of the neglected tropical diseases. A list of similar collaborative
projects follows below. The meeting this week will set out the next
steps required to provide prevention and treatment of the neglected
tropical diseases to all who need them and to work towards the
elimination of the diseases.
