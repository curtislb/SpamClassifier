Thanks, applied as r19019.

Great!

There are other context memory leaks.  Valgrind is a great source of 
frustration.  I tried calling Parrot_free_context() on ctxp->from_ctx and 
ctxp->to_ctx within Parrot_free_context(), as it made sense to me, but that 
didn't work so well.

If you understand this code well enough to have produced a successful patch 
(and you have), there's other investigation here....
