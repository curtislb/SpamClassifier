Yeah, we should do this.  I assume that Vcard supports First/Last name?Note that we also get into issues then with ordering/localization,because some locales (Hungary, for example) use family name _first_.But that's a problem for sugar, really.
If Vcard supports this, it should be trivial to add into the PS.
