I wouldn't bother reading the file into an array at all.  Seems
wasteful.  Instead, read from your file, and let Perl keep track of
the line number for you.  When the line number is one more than a
multiple of 3, ignore it.  When it's two more than a multiple of
three, print it followed by a comma.  When it is a multiple of three,
print it followed by a newline.

#!/usr/bin/env perl
use strict;
use warnings;
while (my $line = <DATA>) {
   next if $. % 3 == 1;
   chomp $line;
   print "$line, " if $. % 3 == 2;
   print "$line\n" if $. % 3 == 0;
}
__DATA__
