Dear Marco,

You might also take a look at ?Anova (or ?Manova) in the car package; the
last examples are for a repeated-measures ANOVA using both MANOVA and
univariate approaches, the latter with GG and HF corrections.

I hope this helps,
 John

> response <- cbind(time1,time2,time3,time4,time5,time6)
> mlmfit <- lm(response ~ group)
> mlmfit1 <- lm(response ~ 1)
> mlmfit0 <- lm(response ~ 0)
> # Test time*group effect

> overall group effect anova.mlm(mlmfit, mlmfit1, M=~1) # Test
