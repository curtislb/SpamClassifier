Hi all,

I'm looking at some sample code from an opensource software package, and
had a question on the the usage of '\' in the following:

$auth_backends = {
        struct_validator => {
                sufficient => 1,
                driver => 'AuthStruct',
                username => \ &common_name_validator
        },

        ldap_backend => {
                driver => 'LDAP',
                required => 1,
                auth_method => 'search',
                host => 'foo.bar.com',

        },
};

There is an explicit space list between \ and &common_name_validator in
the example. I know that if you place a blackslash in front of a
reference, it returns an object, I believe. But what purpose does \ have
as a standalone construct? Or is this merely a typo?

Thanks,

- sf
