[0]theodp writes "A new patent granted to Microsoft Tuesday for
[1]automatic identification of telephone callers based on voice
characteristics covers constructing acoustic models for telephone callers
by identifying words or subject matter commonly used by callers and
capturing the acoustic properties of any utterance. Not only that, it's
done 'without alerting the caller during the call that the caller is
being identified,' boasts Microsoft in the patent claims."

Companies, such as ReputationDefender and DefendMyName will, for a fee,

these efforts can backfire, as the act to get it taken down can sometimes

bshell writes "An article in science blog says we may have to rethink how
genes work. [0]So called "junk DNA" actually appears to be functional.
What's more it works in a mysterious way involving multiple overlaps that
seems to be connected in some sort of network." From the article: "The
ENCODE consortium's major findings include the discovery that the
majority of DNA in the human genome is transcribed into functional
molecules, called RNA, and that these transcripts extensively overlap one
another. This broad pattern of transcription challenges the long-standing
view that the human genome consists of a relatively small set of discrete
genes, along with a vast amount of so-called junk DNA that is not
biologically active. The new data indicates the genome contains very
little unused sequences and, in fact, is a complex, interwoven network.
In this network, genes are just one of many types of DNA sequences that
have a functional impact. "Our perspective of transcription and genes may
have to evolve," the researchers state in their [1]Nature paper, noting
the network model of the genome "poses some interesting mechanistic
questions" that have yet to be answered."

Europeans were riled up last year when a German gunman shot several
people before taking his life at a secondary school. A European Union
Commissioner is taking advantage of the shootings last year called for
stricter regulations in the video game industry. A motion introduced last
month calls for legislators to "put in place all necessary measures to

a patent deal with Microsoft. The company, which started out life as
"Lindows," joins a [2]growing [3]list of [4]patent agreements reached
between Microsoft and [5]vendors. Linspire will be granted a license to
use True Type Fonts and "various code" that would allow for Linspire
users to use voice on Windows Live Messenger as well as the [6]usual
patent protection for Linspire's customers. In return, among other
things, Linspire will make Microsoft's search engine the default search
on PCs shipped with their OS. Kevin Carmony, the CEO for Linspire,
approached Microsoft a year and a half ago, according to the article.

A number of readers wrote us with news of the computer problems on the
International Space Station. Space.com has one of the better writeups on
the [0]failure of Russian computers that control the ISS's attitude and
some life-support systems. Two out of six computers in a redundant system
cannot be rebooted. The space shuttle Atlantis may have its mission
extended until the problem is fixed. A NASA spokesman was optimistic that
the problem can be resolved; worst-case scenario would be for the shuttle
to evacuate everyone onboard the ISS. Engineers are working on the theory
(among others) that the failure may have been triggered by new solar
panels installed earlier in Atlantis's mission.

Late yesterday, Sparter Inc. announced [0]the Gamer2Gamer virtual
currency trading platform. The goal: to provide a secure currency trading
environment for players of Massively Multiplayer Online Games. Rather
than purchasing currency outright, the goal of the project is to cut out
the middleman and (implicitly) the gold-farming consortiums that supply
larger for-pay sites. We were contacted by a representative from the
company before the release went out, looking to speak with the Slashdot
community about the service. In his words, the folks at Gamer2Gamer "are
devoted gamers themselves and are well aware that not everyone will like
the idea -- but we think plenty of folks will like a world where Real
Money Transfer is workable and unintrusive." And so, you get the chance
today to put the hard questions to them. One question per comment,
please, and we'll pass on the best of the lot to be answered as soon as
possible. Update: 06/14 17:58 GMT by [1]Z : Howzer points out that there
is [2]an extensive FAQ on the service, that you can use as a springboard
for questions.

[0]truthsearch writes with a link to a Washington Post article about an
eyebrow raising internal FBI audit recently released to the public. The
document finds that, contrary to a document release back in March, [1]the
FBI frequently overstepped its bounds in collecting data on US citizens.
The article states that the organization may have violated laws or agency
rules 'more than 1,000 times'. "The new audit covers just 10 percent of
the bureau's national security investigations since 2002. The vast
majority of the new violations were instances in which telephone
companies and Internet providers gave agents phone and e-mail records the
agents did not request and were not authorized to collect. But two dozen
of the newly-discovered violations involved agents' requests for
information that U.S. law did not allow them to have."

Llywelyn writes "Apple has [0]released an update to the Windows Safari 3
Beta. According to Macworld the updates '...include correction for a
command injection vulnerability, corrected with additional processing and
validation of URLs that could otherwise lead to an unexpected termination
of the browser; an out-of-bounds memory read issue; and a race condition
that can allow cross-site scripting using a JavaSscript [sic] exploit.'
It is available through either the [1]Apple Safari download site or
through Apple's Software Update."

| Doctor Urges AMA To Classify Gaming Addiction                      |

Doctor Mario writes "The AMA has issued a [0]set of findings and
recommendations (Word document) which follow a lengthy look at possible
connections between gaming and violence, as well as gaming addiction. Ars
Technica has a [1]very good summary of the report, which suggests that
gaming addiction is likely to be a subset of Internet addiction 'as it
most frequently occurs in players of MMORPGs. In both of these
addictions, the current definition is currently informal — the described
symptoms actually most closely resemble pathological gambling, rather
than an addiction. In either case, the report notes, "there is currently
insufficient research to definitively conclude that video game overuse is
an addiction."' The report also recommends that Internet and videogame
addiction be included in a revision to the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders."

| US Falls to 24th Place For Broadband Penetration                   |

[0]amigoro writes "According to research done by the consultancy firm
Point Topic, [1]the US has fallen to 24th place in terms of broadband
penetration, with only 53% of households connected. South Korea led the
pack, with 90% of households having highspeed connections. The US remains
the largest broadband country in the world with more than 60.4 million
subscribers in the quarter with 2.9 million new broadband additions, but
China is fast catching up and has cut the gap to the US from 5.8 million
at the end of 2006 to 4.1 million at end of March 2007. The firm's
research also pointed out the disparity between the connectivity of first
world nations and other places throughout the world. 'Many Sub-Saharan
African states do not register in the figures at all: only South Africa,
Sudan, Senegal and Gabon make it onto the list, with household broadband
penetration running from 1.79% in South Africa - with 215,000 users at
the end of March - to just 0.05% in Sudan - with a mere 3,000. North
African states fare slightly better with Morocco scoring 6.78%
penetration with 418,000 users and Egypt at 1.55% or 240,000.'"

[0]Lucas123 writes "The University of Michigan took its first American
Customer Satisfaction survey and found that of six industries measured
for the Customers' Call Center Satisfaction Index, [1]the PC industry
received the lowest score, according to a Computerworld story. 'According
to the survey, nearly 73% of the people who have bad experiences with
their PC companies' call centers said they will consider purchasing their
next PCs from another company, while 85% of customers who had their
problems resolved by calling a PC call center said they would continue
doing business with the company. Other calls centers included in the
survey included banking, cell phone service, cable and satellite
television, and insurance.'"

jcgam69 writes "When it was discovered in 2005, some thought Eris should
be considered the 10th planet of our solar system. Everyone still
considered Pluto a planet then. At first, Eris was thought to be slightly
larger. Now — with the help of Eris' moon — [0]Eris is known to be 27%
more massive than Pluto. If Pluto had remained a planet to the entire
community of astronomers, surely Eris would be considered the 10th
planet."

| Senate Discusses Third Pipe Using 700MHz Spectrum                  |

+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

Freebird writes "The US Senate Commerce Committee held [0]hearings on the
upcoming 700MHz spectrum auction today, and much of the discussion
centered around Frontline Wireless' proposal to create a commercial
wireless broadband network that would also be used for public safety.
'Under Frontline's proposal, the FCC would auction off 10 MHz from the
commercially available spectrum and offer that to the highest bidder. The
winner would also be given (free) 12 MHz out of the 24 MHz currently
allotted to public safety.' Some senators were skeptical, especially Ted
Stevens of Alaska who had a 'long and testy interchange' with Frontline
CEO James Barksdale. 'He seemed to be zeroing on criticisms that the
Frontline proposal was simply a way for a new company to get a huge
discount on a prime chunk of spectrum by playing the "public safety"
card.'"

Microsoft's Vista team blog. 'The real story is interesting, but
conspiracy theorists will be disappointed to learn that it is not the
result of a deliberate attempt to deceive,' White wrote."
