<B>Coming up this Sunday on Reliable Sources:</B>

<B>Politics and the Media</B>


Rudy Giuliani and Ron Paul take swipes at each other in the Republican debate and the media can't get enough. Bill Clinton makes a video for his wife, Hillary sings for her fans, and several more candidates are flirting with joining the already crowded field of candidates. We'll take a look at the week's political coverage.

<B>Wolfowitz Steps Down</B>


World Bank presidents don't usually garner a large amount of media attention no matter what the circumstances, but Paul Wolfowitz has had a great deal of negative press over the role he played in getting his girlfriend transferred to the State Department with an enormous pay raise. Was the Wolfowitz controversy really a referendum on the Iraq war, and did the media play a role in fanning the flames of this controversy?

<B>The Imus Effect: Radio Hosts vs. Radio Regulators</B>


XM Radio hosts Opie and Anthony have been suspended for 30 days following an offensive sketch on their show.  Are executives running scared in the wake of the Imus scandal, or have they really embraced higher standards of taste?  How long will corporations stay true to new standards and are the executives using the hosts as scapegoats?

<B>Plus, </B>  A BBC reporter's row with Scientologists, an MSNBC anchor's big blunder, and the military puts the kibosh on several popular websites, and stops allowing blogs: censorship or sensible security?

<B>Join us this Sunday and every Sunday at 10am ET / 7am PT for our critical look at the media! </B>
