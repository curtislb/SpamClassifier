[ Picked text/plain from multipart/alternative ]

Can someone direct me to one or two articles that provide a historical
overview of pressure by big pharma and the US (or other governments) on
various countries to refrain from using policy options such as compulsory
licensing, or to adopt TRIPS-plus standards?   Obviously, there is plenty of
material out there about specific countries or policy debates in various
fora.  But I’m hoping to find one or two items that give a reader, who is
not familiar with all of this background, a quick introduction to the real
global politics of this issue with concrete examples of the kind of pressure
which countries face.



Thanks for any suggestions.



Richard
