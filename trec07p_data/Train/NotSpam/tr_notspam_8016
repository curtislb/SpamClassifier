Hi everyone!
I=B4m trying to install a file manager on sugar, but i=B4m having difficult=
ies
creating activities. I=B4ve downloaded the rpms for Xfe and Rox (two file
managers i want to test), installed them, and they work just fine when i
call them from console. Now i want to have an activity for them.

Basically, i=B4ve copied the RGBPaint activity and modified it. The icon fo=
r
the file manager appears on the activities frame, and if you click on it,
it=B4ll launch the program. But with some issues... it seems that the progr=
am
is running for one side, and the activity is running separately. In fact,
the activity is just an empty window with its close button. The only way to
focus on the program is by pressing alt+p, and if you close either the
activity with the close button or the program (File-->Exit Xfe), the other
won=B4t close. I=B4m having this problem with every program i want to insta=
ll,
including Opera with the instructions from wiki.laptop.org.

I looked at the logs and i saw the same error messages, something to do wit=
h
Dbus, i don=B4t remember right now the message, but it=B4s something like "=
no
process is responding to xxxxxx activity".

Can anyone tell me what i=B4m doing wrong? Or if there=B4s any good
documentation on creating activities on sugar? Because i could only find a
couple of tutorials, but they=B4re useless (the HelloWorld activity on
wiki.laptop...it=B4s waaaaay too basic).

Emiliano
