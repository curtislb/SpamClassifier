[0]coderpath asks: "At a recent [1]Seattle Ruby Brigade hack night
someone asked how many people used the DVORAK keyboard layout. Out of 9
people, 7 used DVORAK and only 2 were using QWERTY. I personally made the
switch last Christmas, after 25 years of typing with QWERTY. What do you
use? Have you switched to DVORAK? Have you been wanting to make the
switch? Has anyone else noticed an increase in adoption of DVORAK
lately?"

The pride of his collection is an Apple Lisa, one of the first computers

sell for more than $10,000. In an old barn in Northern California that
also houses pigs, Bruce Damer, 45, keeps a collection that includes a

1973) and early Apple prototypes. '

A [0]trio of teams have banded together to succeed in the 'FIRST Robotics
Competition'. The teams Bobcat Robotics from South Windsor, Connecticut,
Highrollers from Las Vegas, Nevada, and Gompei and the HERD from
Worcester, Massachusetts combined to create a versatile robot geared to
succeeding at a number of odd tasks. "These young people had six weeks to
perfect their machines. And they had the enthusiasm of any athletic
competition. From tie-dyed shirts to human hair dyed in school colors,
competitors from 23 countries showed that math, science and brains can
provide a lot of excitement ... Whether it is computer programming,
wiring a motor or scouting rivals to develop strategy, students said the
skills they develop often go beyond the contest. Clearly, the event has
piqued the interest of major sponsors such as NASA, which will broadcast
webcasts of the competitions."

An anonymous reader writes "Microsoft says there are over 1,000
applications you can run on Windows Vista with few, if any, issues.
However, Windows apps number in the tens of thousands. Add to that the
facts that x64 Vista versions don't support legacy 16-bit code, and that
the Windows Resource Protection in Vista breaks some apps, and you've got
a big issue. InformationWeek lists a host of workarounds in [0]How To
Manage Windows Vista Application Compatibility. Among the tips discussed
are Vista's compatibility mode, its Program Compatibility Assistant
wizard, and a little-known form of file and registry virtualization
that's built into the OS. What problems have you encountered with
incompatible apps, and are any issues you've encountered deal-breakers
that could further roil the already muddied adoption picture for Vista?"

[0]Ashley Gittins writes "Users of the popular accounting package
[1]SQL-Ledger were being kept in the dark about a recent license change.
Two weeks ago a new version of the software was released but along with
it came the silent change of license from GPLv2 to the '[2]SQL-Ledger
Open Source License' â€” presumably in an effort to prevent future forks
like [3]LedgerSMB. As it turns out, the author was making deliberate
attempts to [4]prevent the community from finding out about the license
change. No posts to the SQL-Ledger mailing lists asking about the license
change were getting past moderation and direct questions to the author
were going unanswered. Just recently the license was switched back to
GPLv2. This behavior is not a first for this particular project, and is
part of the reason for the original LedgerSMB fork. Does a project
maintainer have an ethical obligation to notify his or her community of a
license change? What about a legal obligation?"

Remember the [0]hexagon surrounding Saturn's north pole? Now for our
delectation Ano_Nimass Coward sends us to Space.com for a look at a
[1]nebula with near perfect bilateral symmetry surrounding a dying star.
The so-called Red Square ranks among the most symmetrical objects ever
observed by scientists. "If you fold things across the principle diagonal
axis, you get an almost perfect reflection symmetry," said the leader of
a study of the object, recently published in Science. A possible
explanation for the structure's glow, if not its shape, was advanced in a
paper appearing in PNAS, which attributes the glow of a similar object â€”
dubbed, confusingly, the Red Rectangle â€” to [2]exotic space-hardened
organic molecules called Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons. PAHs are
normally unstable but may occur in places like the nebula in question, in
nanostructured clusters that are extremely stable and radiation hardened.
