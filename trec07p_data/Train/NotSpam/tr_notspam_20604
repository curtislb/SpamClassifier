Hi Jim, I've just added "Guido van Robot" to the olpc activities wiki.
http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Software_projects#Guido_van_Robot_.28educational_programming_language.29
http://gvr.sourceforge.net/

It's a localized minimalistic programming language and it comes with a
GTK based IDE and 18 lessons. (All GPL and FDL of course)
It's used in classrooms to teach young students the basic concepts of
programming for over three years now and it now supports eight
languages.
It's stable and it runs, almost, perfectly on the XO.

I'm currently working on adding the lessons to the package and turning it
into a olpc "activity bundle".

Regards,
Stas Zytkiewicz
