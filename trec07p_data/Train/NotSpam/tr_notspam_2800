Hello there

André, the artwork author for etch is organizing an artwork team.
I don't know what is the state of it, so, i am only welcoming you.

You can chat with desktop members and users at irc.debian.org
#debian-desktop . 

André's nickname is si0ux.

Anyway, if you have proposals, they are all evaluated and (or not)
integrated in debian.

please check http://wiki.debian.org/DebianDesktopArtwork

best regards
Luis Matos
