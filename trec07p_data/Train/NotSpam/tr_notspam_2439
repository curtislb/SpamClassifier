Not my problem at the moment but a colleague pointed
out that he had 750+ variables. Excel handles 256. 

Actually my problem is now a SAS one where I can get a
clean csv export but lose the variable labels.  My
crude workaround was just to do a proc contents and
cut-and-paste the results.  A  pain but it worked.  

I've got to figure out why I cannot get Hmisc to work!


Thanks for the suggestion.
