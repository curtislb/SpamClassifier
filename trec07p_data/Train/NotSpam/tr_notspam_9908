I think you're wrong here ... (certainly if the entire grant is by a 
single entity)

As, presumably, they do. Hence "GPL plus restrictions".

Thing is, the licence, as granted by the !copyright holder! is not 
"GPL", but "GPL plus restrictions". The result can't be invalid, because 
it is granted by the copyright holder, and is clear as to what is 
granted.

A "GPL plus restrictions" is only invalid when the GPL is granted by one 
entity, and the restrictions imposed by a different one. I can't licence 
my code as "plus restrictions" and mix it with "pure GPL" code by 
someone else.
