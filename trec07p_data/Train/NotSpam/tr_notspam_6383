More than a million Cellular One customers have access to Napster Mobile
hosted by Ericsson




STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN, Apr 30, 2007 (MARKET WIRE via COMTEX News Network) --
Cellular One customers across the US have access to the world's largest
mobile music catalog thanks to a joint partnership between the wireless
provider, Ericsson (NASDAQ: ERIC) and Napster (NASDAQ: NAPS) announced
today. Napster Mobile is available to customers of Cellular One from
Dobson Cellular Systems, one of the largest providers of wireless
services in rural America. The service features Napster's massive
catalog of over 3 million full-length songs enabling Cellular One's more
than 1.6 million customers to easily enjoy music on their wireless
handset and on their PC. 

Tom Roberts, Chief Marketing Officer for Cellular One, says: "This
agreement gives Cellular One customers an outstanding catalog of music
available directly from their wireless handset. This is another example
of how consumers are increasingly using their wireless handsets in
non-traditional ways and we are making cutting-edge technology and
services available to our customer base." 

Cellular One subscribers in 17 US states have access to Napster Mobile,
allowing them to search and browse the content in Napster's catalog and
buy and receive full-length songs via their wireless handset. Since
Napster Mobile is a dual-platform, digital music service fully
integrated with Napster's PC offering, a copy of the purchased content
is simultaneously sent to the customer's PC. 

Brad Duea, President of Napster, says: "By partnering with Ericsson and
utilizing its unique hosting platforms, we have an effective channel in
place that providers can use to include Napster's strong brand and music
services in their mobile media content offerings. We are excited to work
with Cellular One, a leader in the dynamic environment of mobile
content, and now among a growing number of providers offering Napster
Mobile to subscribers." 

Napster Mobile is based on a service delivery platform tailored for
media delivery. Ericsson will host, integrate and manage the
round-the-clock-operations of the service for Cellular One from Dobson
under a managed service agreement. The agreement also includes content
aggregation and digital rights management and is based on a risk- and
revenue-share model. 

Angel Ruiz, President of Ericsson North America, says: "Our hosted
solutions are strategically designed to enable innovative and leading
providers like Cellular One to quickly and cost-effectively deliver
valuable services to their customers. Ericsson helps providers retain
customers longer and gain new customers in greater numbers by enhancing
the wireless experience for subscribers, without losing focus on
operational efficiency." 

Ericsson is shaping the future of Mobile and Broadband Internet
communications through its continuous technology leadership. Providing
innovative solutions in more than 140 countries, Ericsson is helping to
create the most powerful communication companies in the world.
