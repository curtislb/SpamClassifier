A better answer regarding the tts dependencies ...

Well, here's what I wrote about getting it working on slackware 9.1
http://www.cs.vassar.edu/~priestdo/emacspeak/list.archive.2004/msg00128.html

Apparently it's not actually a statically linked binary because I had
to use glibc 2.3.1 and invoke viavoice using ld-2.3.1.so. We take
a lot for granted with distros, it's generally easy to build kernels
but the toolchain can be a bear. Note that the library enu50.so
(the speech engine) not only required an old glibc, it had to be
invoked using old loader. When I did this I had two glibc versions
and two loader versions on my system. I don't know if there is a
better way, but this approach worked on slackware and lfs.

At one point I was able to get it working on newer slackware
by using old binaries, but that eventually was not reliable anymore.
I have no idea if that is still true today, or if the instructions in my
archived message still work, apparently I did it three years ago.

Also from my notes, on slackware I used rpm2tgz to unpack viavoice.
Now I remember, the rpm tool choked because of dependencies.

I spent an insane amount of time getting viavoice working on
newer system. I for one have appreciation for what was done
with TTSynth, whatever that was I have no idea.
