Open Society Institute Public Health Program

Access to Essential Medicines Grant Competition

REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS - due July 16, 2007

Introduction

Despite advances in medical science, safe and affordable medicines
remain inaccessible in many developing countries.  According to the
World Health Organization, 30% of the world’s population lacks access to
essential medicines—estimated at between 1.3 and 2.1 billion people.
Current procurement mechanisms, lack of transparency, intellectual
property protections, and legal restrictions constitute major barriers
to needed medications in many parts of the world.  The human cost of
these policies is enormous with developing countries showing an average
life expectancy of 14 years less than that for developed countries.

The creation of the World Health Organization Commission on Intellectual
Property Rights, Innovation, and Public Health in 2003 and subsequent
Intergovernmental Working Group on Intellectual Property, Innovation and
Health recognizes this urgency and signals increased global interest in
access issues and innovation for neglected diseases.  Civil society
engagement and the voices of the global South are crucial for a genuine
shift in framework.  Currently, there are a handful of Southern
organizations carrying out cutting-edge access to medicines work in
their home countries.  However, budget and staffing constraints limit
their participation in international and regional arenas and their
ability to increase public awareness and advocacy at the national level.
  In an effort to strengthen needed capacity, the Open Society Institute
Public Health and Information Programs are seeking applications from
qualified organizations interested in receiving institutional support
for their work on access to essential medicines.


Project Summary

Funding is available for organizations with a mandate and demonstrated
capacity to advance policy and civil society engagement related to
access to medicines.  Funding for access to medicines work will be
unrestricted and can be used for salaries, overhead, and projects of the
applicants’ choosing.  Requests of up to $75,000 annually will be
considered.  OSI anticipates renewing this support for a three year
period.

If requested, technical assistance will be offered throughout the length
of the grant period.  OSI may further sponsor seminars and meetings for
grantees to share lessons learned.

The Open Society Institute

The Open Society Institute (OSI) is a private operating and grantmaking
foundation based in New York City that serves as a hub of the Open
Society Network, a group of autonomous foundations and organizations in

The Access to Medicines Project

The Access to Medicines project supports efforts to increase access to
essential medicines to developing countries and marginalized
populations.  Work has focused on three key areas:  transparency and
monitoring of the pharmaceutical industry; procurement mechanisms, and
intellectual property.  The project promotes civil society engagement
with these issues and actively supports a civil society platform around
the WHO Working Group on innovation for neglected diseases.  The project
works closely with OSI’s palliative care and harm reduction initiatives.

This project is located within OSI’s Public Health Program.  Additional
information on the Public Health Program can be found at
www.soros.org/health.

The Information Program
The Information Program aims to enhance the ability to access, exchange,
and produce knowledge and information for key open society
constituencies and disadvantaged groups, especially in the poorer parts
of the world.  It further supports the use of new tools and techniques
to empower civil society in national, regional, and global arenas.
