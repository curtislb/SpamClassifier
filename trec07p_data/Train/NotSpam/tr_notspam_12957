Parrot has four types of registers, for integers, floating point numbers, 
strings, and PMCs.

With hot-spot operations as you might find in number crunching code, Parrot 
and the underlying CPU may be able to operate on the values in registers 
almost directly (that is, load from Parrot register into CPU register, store 
back) without having to marshall and demarshall all of the Parrot arguments 
for a section of code into and out of a single stack.

Without particular benchmarks, however, it's difficult to give any particular 
performance guidelines.

For a point of comparison, however, Perl 5 spends a lot of time in managing 
the argument stack--a significant amount of time for otherwise small and fast 
operations.

 - better compiler tools than lex and yacc.
 - native support for plenty of dynamic language features, if they want them
 - whatever portability and maturity Parrot has at the time
 - interoperability to whatever degree they allow

Of course.  We can't do the C++ trick of compiling class attribute access into 
slot offset access.  The world doesn't cool to near absolute zero when 
compile time ends.  Someday, someone may want to add an attribute to a class 
at runtime.

Some static compilers and environments do use runtime profiling to identify 
optimizations that static analysis was unable to discover.

Snarkily, it's better than the JVM because it actually supports features of 
dynamic languages natively without forcing all dynamic languages built on it 
to invent everything besides "look up named method at runtime".

It's better than the CLR because the Parrot copyright holders don't have the 
plans or (as far as I know) the ability to bring patent suits against anyone 
who uses Parrot.  Also our definition of portability is more than "Both 
Windows XP AND Vista".

Structural typing and related optimizations.

As for gains, it's not difficult for me to imagine that Parrot could support 
something like Smalltalk's browser.

I don't understand this question.  Are they statically typed or dynamically 
typed?

Now if you're asking whether, as with some Lisp implementations, you can give 
optional type hints to the compiler so that it can perform optimizations, 
then that's indeed a feature of Perl 6 and Parrot will support it somehow.

We haven't reached the point of worrying about optimizations, however.

More charitably you might say "There are no concrete designs for these systems

This is UnManagedStruct.

I don't believe it would do so at compile time.  Neither Python nor Perl do 
this to my knowledge.

I suppose it would perform type analysis on some sort of abstract tree 
structure before generating Parrot bytecode.

Primitive handling operations.
Aggreggate access.
Method lookup and invocation.

Then their semantics differ, and you can only rely on their documented 
interfaces for appropriate behavior, the same way that you can only rely on 
the documented interface of objects outside of your control.

I don't see why.  Certainly you have to be cognizant if you're crossing a 
language boundary, but all of the cross-language code I've written so far has 
worked without problems.

I don't understand the question.  The point of view of Parrot is "What 
behavior does Parrot need to support to be a good host for dynamic 
languages?"  That's not at all independent of target languages.

Thus, vtables.

All string-like PMCs implement a set of string vtable entries.  All access to 
string data goes through those vtables.

A GroovyString PMC that performs the "clear string" operation when code 
invokes its "concatenate" vtable entry is buggy in the same way that it would 
be if it launched Nethack instead.

For a language to interoperate with other languages through its PMCs, those 
PMCs must adhere to the semantics of the appropriate PMC vtable interfaces.

I think you're overstating the case.

Ditto.

I don't see it as such a problem.  I can imagine that Parrot could detect 
cross-language calls and morph variables appropriately, but I have some 
amount of confidence that the vtable interfaces are well-chosen.

Of course, and we could suggest in a very JVM-ish way that all dynamic 
languages should roll their own string concatenation operators (hey, just two 
string fetches, a splice, and a store!).

That's not Parrot's goal, however.

No benchmark; won't speculate beyond saying that the object structure only 
needs a pointer to a vtable shared by all entities of that PMC type.

I don't understand this question.

Indeed, in the same way that C's performance (especially during compilation) 
can vary greatly, depending on the quantitiy of variables in scope in 
subroutines.

Perhaps.  Perhaps not.  Unimplemented.

I doubt that.  By far most of the programs I've ever written (let alone seen) 
spend more time IO-bound than CPU bound.

I consider the use of smaller subroutines to offer orders of magnitude in 
benefit with regard to maintainable code, far more than any potential gain or 
loss of performance.

I suspect that line of thinking is prevalent among many other users of dynamic 
languages.

Unspecified at the moment.

Interoperability.

To some degree, optimization.

It's easier to optimize a reasonably simple, if specialized, operation than it 
is to optimize the same operation built out of many more, if simpler, 
components.

You can certainly have only one "add" opcode in a system, and that's fine.  It 
pops two arguments off of the stack, checks their types, and performs the 
right type of operation, deciding if it's an integral addition or a floating 
point addition and what type of result to provide.

Or you could have "add_int_int_int" (which takes two ints and produces an int) 
and "add_float_int_float" (which takes an int and a float and produces a 
float) and compile that code down to JITted instructions.

Then get rid of the stack and you can dispatch to those ops without going 
through the thunk.

Then use VM registers, and you always know how to map to and from the right 
CPU registers with the proper offsets into your call frame, and things might 
get even faster.

Then again, no benchmarks; shouldn't speculate.

I don't really understand the question.

I don't understand this question either.  Can you give an example?

So is Perl.  I find understanding Perl 5's design helpful in working on 
Parrot.

Doubtful.

It already supports strings, floats, and integers.  Do you mean bits and 
chunks of memory x-bits wide?  There is support for that to some degree.

I don't understand which type of register you mean when you first use the 
word.  Additionally, I don't understand the question either way I could 
interpret it.
