The problem is the use of winbindd_idmap.tdb from smbd.
If we change something in the future we may forget again there is
pdb_tdb.c that expects something there.You should have used passdb.tdb
IMO.
By moving everything to a common function at least we keep all access to
the same tdb in one place so future changes will less likely break
something.

Simo.
