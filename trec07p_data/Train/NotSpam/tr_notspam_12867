Analysis: Pharma swimming against IP tide?

By OLGA PIERCE
UPI Health Business Correspondent

WASHINGTON, May 23 (UPI) -- In an effort to head off a potential
worldwide flood of so-called compulsory drug licenses -- where foreign
countries skirt intellectual-property laws and make generic versions of
a patented drug -- the head of the U.S. pharmaceutical manufacturers'
trade group met with Thai officials this week, but activists say those
efforts might not prove successful.

"It's not just what Thailand is doing," said Billy Tauzin, CEO of the
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a lobbying group
that represents U.S. drug makers.

"The example set by the Thais is very important," Tauzin told reporters
after the meeting with Thai Health Minister Mongkol na Songkhla, where
he said he urged the government to return to negotiations with drug
manufacturers.

World Trade Organization rules allow countries to issue a compulsory
license overriding intellectual-property rights when they need drugs to
combat a public-health emergency. The license allows the country to
manufacture its own generic version of a drug while making a small
royalty payment to the drug company that holds the drug's patent.

The Thai government has taken advantage of the compulsory license
provision several times in the past year, issuing compulsory licenses
for the AIDS treatments Kaletra and Sustiva, saying it could not afford
to provide treatment to the roughly 500,000 Thais with HIV at the prices
the manufacturers want to charge.

Pushing the definition of "public health emergency," the government then
issued a license for the blood thinner Plavix, and earlier this month
the Health Ministry said it will issue compulsory licenses for cancer drugs.

Use of compulsory licenses could spread far beyond the borders of
Thailand. Brazil recently issued its own compulsory license for Sustiva,
and other countries appear poised to follow suit.

To prevent a worldwide explosion of the licenses, the pharmaceutical
manufacturers' association is fighting back, Tauzin told United Press
International. In addition to meetings with officials in developing
countries, the group is urging the U.S. government to consider pushing
back at the Thai government by taking away preferential trade status or
filing a complaint with the World Trade Organization, a reversal of the
current official position that the Thai licenses are in accordance with
international law.

"We can and will continue to have discussions with our own government
and officials around the world to promote intellectual property
protection," he said.

Drug manufacturers also hope their support of charity programs in the
United States and the developing world will encourage countries to
negotiate, instead of issuing compulsory licenses, Tauzin added.

But those efforts may not be enough to outweigh the pressures countries
face to expand access to AIDS treatment.

Legally, countries are well within their rights to issue the licenses,
and economically they have a tremendous incentive to do so, said Shamnad
Basheer, a visiting professor of intellectual-property law at George
Washington University.

"A lot of countries are going to see this as an enormous opportunity,"
Basheer told UPI.

Countries like Thailand are such a small part of the global market for
the drugs that their licenses are unlikely to cost countries in the form
of less research and development as drug manufacturers have alleged, he
said, but the countries have a lot to gain by making cheaper drugs to
treat their AIDS populations.

Because those forces are strong, drug makers would have more success
changing the way they sell drugs than trying to legally or politically
pressure developing countries, Basheer said. "There's a problem with how
they are selling in the global market, and they need to look at it and
change it.

"They need to think of innovative ways of changing their business model,
of changing their pricing.

Many advocates of the compulsory licenses are defiant in the face of
drug company admonitions.

"The bottom line here is that compulsory licenses are a right that every
nation has and no amount of propaganda from (drug companies) is going to
change that," Michael Weinstein, president of the AIDS Healthcare
Foundation, told UPI.

"Thailand is doing the right thing and the (pharmaceutical
manufacturers' association) is trying to demonize them and it won't
work," Weinstein said.

"If you want to take a stand on intellectual property (covering)
sunglasses, that's one thing. But you can't do it over lifesaving
medication."
