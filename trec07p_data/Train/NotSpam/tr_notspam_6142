I've done realclean a few times actually.  If I run with r18322, it 
runs just fine, but r18323, which dealt with zero length mallocs for 
strings, caused it to start crashing.  Here's a backtrace.  This is one 
of those tests where with -G it succeeds, so you'll have to make sure 
that gc is enabled.  I'm not having any trouble on my darwin/ppc 
machine, but my only two running platforms are darwin/ppc and 
freebsd/amd64.
