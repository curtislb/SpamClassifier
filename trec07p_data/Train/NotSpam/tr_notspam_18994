9:47 PM, 6/13/07, Update: Spacewalk ends=20

Astronauts Pat Forrester and Steve Swanson wrapped up a grueling seven-hour=
 and 16-minute spacewalk today after partially retracting a solar array bla=
nket and setting up a powerful rotary joint needed to turn another set of a=
rrays to follow the sun. When the spacewalk ended, Forrester was getting al=
arms for high carbon dioxide levels in his suit but NASA officials said he =
was never in any danger.

The astronauts did not fully activate the starboard solar alpha rotary join=
t, or SARJ, as originally planned after flight controllers discovered two d=
rive motors apparently were wired backward. Commands sent to drive lock ass=
embly No. 1 actually went to DLA-2 and vice versa.

Playing it safe, flight controllers told Swanson and Forrester to leave one=
 launch lock engaged to make sure the newly installed S4 solar array blanke=
ts, which stretch 240 feet from tip to tip, can't inadvertently move while =
engineers make sure they understand the operation of the starboard SARJ.

Otherwise, Forrester and Swanson accomplished all of their primary objectiv=
es, helping ground controllers retract the 115-foot-long P6-2B solar array =
blanket some 45 feet, installing internal braces to stiffen the S3 segment =
and removing a variety of launch locks and restraints from the SARJ to get =
it ready for operation.

"Very nice job today, guys," astronaut Jim Reilly radioed from inside the s=
tation. "Excellent work."

"Thanks for the help, you and the ground," one of the spacewalkers replied.

"Houston concurs, you guys did a great job today," astronaut Megan McArthur=
 chimed in from mission control.

This was the 85th spacewalk devoted to station assembly and maintenance sin=
ce construction began in 1998 and the second for Atlantis' crew. Astronauts=
 Jim Reilly and Danny Olivas spent six hours and 15 minutes attaching the S=
3/S4 solar array truss Monday while Swanson and Forrester logged seven hour=
s and 16 minutes today, for a cumulative mission total of 13 hours and 31 m=
inutes. Total station spacewalk time through 85 EVAs now stands at 522 hour=
s and 36 minutes.

Reilly and Olivas plan to stage a third spacewalk Friday. Among other tasks=
, the astronauts plan to repair a pulled-up insulation blanket on the shutt=
le's left-side Orbital Maneuvering System rocket pod. Anchored to the shutt=
le's robot arm, one of the spacewalkers will push the 4-inch by 6-inch blan=
ket back in place and use a surgical stapler to secure it for re-entry.

A fourth spacewalk, by Swanson and Forrester, is scheduled Sunday to accomp=
lish any unfinished tasks, to perform "get aheads" for future assembly work=
 and to finish the P6-2B solar array retraction, if necessary.

Additional details will be posted here after this evening's mission status =
briefing.
