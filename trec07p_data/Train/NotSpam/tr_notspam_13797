O.K. Got that.  Had to get tpconfig, it wasn't on the machine.
Am trying to lower the z threshold, it's currently reported at 6 of 7 by 
tpconfig -i.
Have tried "tpconfig -Z 4" but that doesn't do anything. Then tried 
"tpconfig -Z4", again nothing.  Then "tpcofig --threshold 4".  After 
each attempt tpconfig -i reports
that threshold is still at 6
Suggestions
