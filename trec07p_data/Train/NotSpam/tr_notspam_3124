*blush* yes, that was it.

So I've now successfully done a ./sugar-jhbuild update

But I'm now having problems with ./sugar-jhbuild build-base

Some dependencies listed I already have; some dependencies listed I  
don't know where to get.

On the former: it originally said it needed automake 1.7 and 1.9. I  
got automake from macports and the 1.9 is no long listed as a missing  
dependency, but automake 1.7 still is.

I have libtools but it is showing as a missing dependency. As with  
expat.

James
