Hello sm1lies,

It's time for another Microsoft Connected Services Framework Competition.  $4,500 is up for grabs!

Microsoft Corp. and BT Group PLC, in association with TopCoder(R), are currently running a series of Connected Services Sandbox Mashup Service Design and Assembly competitions.  The competitions encourage participants to create "network mashups" that merge telecommunications features, such as voice and text messaging, with Web 2.0 applications like mapping and search.
 
A new Creative Design competition launched today that asks developers to create a storyboard for a mashup idea and present that idea -- either graphically or through written specifications -- to a panel of British Telecom judges. The winning mashup design from the Creative stage will move on to the Assembly stage, where developers will build a prototype of the winning design.

Prizes will be awarded to the top three mashup ideas, with a total prize purse of $4,500.  Check out the contest details at http://csf.topcoder.com/.  

Best of luck to you in the CSF Competition Series!
