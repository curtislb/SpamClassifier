04:00 PM, 6/22/07, Update: Atlantis glides to California landing=20

Running a day late because of blustery Florida weather, the space shuttle A=
tlantis dropped out of a sunny Mojave Desert sky and swooped to a smooth to=
uchdown on runway 22 at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., to close out an act=
ion-packed space station assembly mission.

Flying upside down and backward over the Indian Ocean half a world away, sh=
uttle commander Rick Sturckow and pilot Lee Archambault fired Atlantis' twi=
n braking rockets at 2:43:47 p.m. EDT for 2 minutes and 33 seconds, slowing=
 the ship by about 200 mph - just enough to drop it into the atmosphere for=
 an hourlong glide back to Earth.

The astronauts had hoped to return to Florida, but cloudy weather and rain =
showers prevented a landing Thursday. With a forecast for more of the same =
on tap today, entry Flight Director Norm Knight diverted the crew to Edward=
s one orbit after waving off the first of two opportunities to land at the =
Kennedy Space Center.

Approaching California from the southwest just off the Baja peninsula, Atla=
ntis streaked above San Diego in a steep descent toward Edwards some 100 mi=
les northeast of Los Angeles. Heralded by twin sonic booms, Sturckow took o=
ver manual control as the shuttle descended through 50,000 feet, guided the=
 orbiter through a sweeping right overhead turn and then down to a picture-=
perfect touchdown on runway 22 at 3:49:38 p.m. EDT.

"Houston, Atlantis, wheels stopped," Sturckow radioed mission control when =
the shuttle rolled to a halt.

"Atlantis, Houston, copy wheels stopped. Welcome back, congratulations on a=
 great mission," replied astronaut Dominic "Tony" Antonelli from the Johnso=
n Space Center.

Flight surgeons were standing by to assist returning space station astronau=
t Sunita Williams, who made the trip back to Earth resting on her back in a=
 recumbent seat bolted to the floor of the shuttle's lower deck. Launched t=
o the station last December, Williams logged 195 days off the planet - a si=
ngle-flight record for female astronauts.

"I can't wait to get back and feel the air on my face and the sea breeze," =
Williams told a reporter Wednesday. "I'm looking forward to hopefully going=
 to the beach and taking a walk with my husband and my dog. That's the firs=
t thing. And secondly, I just can't wait for a good piece of pizza."

And a hair cut.

"I think I'm going to have a lot flatter hair when I get back," she laughed=
. "So I think I'm going to have to work on getting a hair cut as soon as I =
get back so it looks a little bit normal. I have been living like this with=
 hair up and flying around for a little while, so it's going to be funny to=
 see what it looks like when I get home."

She might get the haircut, but it might be a while before Williams feels up=
 to a stroll on the beach. It typically takes returning space station astro=
nauts a month or so to get their land legs back and up to a full year to co=
mpletely recover from the bone and muscle loss associated with long stays i=
n weightlessness.

Williams said earlier she had exercised as required throughout her stay abo=
ard the station and she did not anticipate any major problems readapting to=
 gravity.

Her shuttle crewmates - Sturckow, Archambault, flight engineer Steve Swanso=
n, Pat Forrester, Danny Olivas and Jim Reilly - were expected to doff their=
 pressure suits and greet NASA officials on the runway for a quick inspecti=
on of the orbiter. All seven astronauts plan to spend the night at Edwards =
before flying back to the Johnson Space Center on Saturday.

Mission duration was 13 days 20 hours 11 minutes and 34 seconds covering 21=
9 complete orbits and 5.8 million miles since blastoff June 8.

Atlantis blasted off three months late because of hail damage to the ship's=
 external fuel tank. The shuttle's primary payload was a 36,000-pound $367 =
million solar array truss segment, along with a fresh station crew member -=
 Clay Anderson - to replace Williams.

The S3/S4 solar array truss was attached to the right side of the lab's mai=
n power truss the day after docking and hooked up during three spacewalks b=
y Reilly, Olivas, Swanson and Forrester. The astronauts also completed the =
retraction of another set of arrays that must be repositioned later this ye=
ar.

Because of concern about a peeled-back insulation blanket on the shuttle's =
left-side Orbital Maneuvering System rocket pod, NASA managers extended the=
 shuttle flight two days and added a fourth spacewalk to give the crew time=
 to make repairs and complete their other work. The repair job eventually w=
as added to the third spacewalk and Olivas, anchored to the end of the shut=
tle's robot arm, pushed the blanket back down and used a surgical stapler a=
nd stainless steel pins to hold it in place.

Engineers will examine the rocket pod later to make sure it didn't suffer a=
ny heat damage during re-entry. But the blanket appeared intact and in plac=
e on the runway, indicating the repair job worked as expected. The shuttle'=
s critical nose cape, wing leading edge panels and heat-shield tiles showed=
 no obvious signs of any major damage.

Atlantis' mission was challenging enough without major space station proble=
ms but that's exactly what happened last week during installation of the S3=
/S4 solar array truss. At roughly the same time the new arrays were attache=
d, the Russian command module's three guidance, navigation and control comp=
uters, known collectively as the terminal computer, along with three high-l=
evel command-and-control machines known as the central computer, failed to =
reboot after the guidance system crashed. After three days of around-the-cl=
ock troubleshooting, Russian engineers asked station commander Fyodor Yurch=
ikhin and flight engineer Oleg Kotov to install jumper cables to bypass sus=
pect secondary power supply switches.

The repair worked and after additional tests and checkout, two computers, o=
r "lanes," in each system were brought back on line. The other two were kep=
t off line in backup mode. But engineers still don't know what caused the s=
o-called soft switches in the secondary power supplies to act up. The circu=
itry is designed to cut off power to the computers if the incoming electric=
ity isn't stable to within fairly narrow parameters.

Some engineers suspected the new solar arrays caused some slight change in =
the station's power grid that affected the power supply switches. But durin=
g a test last Friday, the computers were isolated from the new arrays and t=
hey still failed to boot up. Yurchikhin and Kotov then bypassed the seconda=
ry power supply switches and all six computers ultimately were successfully=
 activated.

On Thursday, the two off-line backup computers - lane No. 1 of the central =
computer and lane No. 2 in the terminal computer - were powered back up, ve=
rified to be healthy and then shut down so Yurchikhin and Kotov could remov=
e the power supply bypass jumpers in a test to help engineers determine whe=
ther the cause of last week's problem was transitory or the result of some =
ongoing issue.

But the computers failed to boot up without the jumpers, indicating whateve=
r caused the problem last week is still there, or at least the problem in t=
he power supplies is still present. Russian mission managers plan to launch=
 replacement computer gear aboard an unmanned Progress supply ship schedule=
d for takeoff July 22. But before they install any new gear, engineers woul=
d like to pin down the root cause of the earlier computer problems.

Next up for NASA is launch of the shuttle Endeavour around Aug. 7 to delive=
r a short spacer segment that will be attached to the S4 solar array permit=
ting the eventual attachment of a new set of arrays - S6 - next year. The c=
rew also will deliver an external equipment storage platform.

The Endeavour mission features educator-astronaut Barbara Morgan, backup to=
 Challenger "teacher-in-space" Christa McAuliffe. Morgan is now a full-fled=
ged astronaut making her first flight.
