I agree entirely with Gabor.  My advice would be to just ignore the people =
who=20
think differently -- however, if you want those particular folks to respond=
,=20
you'll have to play by their rules.  (and if you don't play by their rules,=
=20
you'll just have to ignore the consequences -- this _IS_ the internet, afte=
r=20
all).
