HEADLINES:
TWO CLAIMS OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR IRAQI PARLIAMENT BOMBING
Two claims of responsibility for the Iraqi parliament cafeteria attack have been posted on Islamic Web sites by the same insurgent umbrella group.  The differing claims -- posted by the Islamic State of Iraq -- employ similar and non-contradictory concepts.  But the fact that there are two claims could indicate that the movement is disorganized and split into factions. Or it could be that the second claim was made because the initial one claimed three members of parliament were killed in the yesterday’s attack. Today, U.S. and Iraqi authorities said that only one had died.  There are about six groups in the Islamic State of Iraq. Al Qaeda in Iraq is one of them, and the Islamic Army in Iraq is another. Evidence of disunity recently popped up in the Arab media.

NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR CORZINE IMPROVING, STILL CRITICAL, AFTER CAR CRASH
New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine remained in critical but stable condition in a hospital intensive care unit today after a highway crash last night in which he sustained "severe trauma," a doctor said.  "There's no way to tell how close he came to more severe injuries, but based on the pictures I've seen of the crash, I think he was lucky," said Doctor Steven Ross, head of trauma at Cooper University Hospital in Camden.  It does not appear Corzine was wearing a seat belt at the time of the crash, said his spokesman, Anthony Coley.  The governor was a front-seat passenger in an SUV driven by a New Jersey state trooper. It crashed on the Garden State Parkway in Galloway Township, just north of Atlantic City.  The governor's left thigh bone was broken in two places, with the femur bone popping through the skin, according to Doctor Robert Ostrum, an orthopedic surgeon who operated on the leg yesterday. Other injuries include several broken ribs on each side, a broken sternum, a b!
 roken collarbone and a slightly fractured lower vertebrae.  Ostrum said Corzine also had a large cut on his face that was repaired by a plastic surgeon.  Corzine remains on a ventilator and is heavily sedated to control pain from his chest fractures.  But the governor "significantly improved" overnight, Ross said. "He does awaken, and is able to communicate with us a little bit. ... He is doing well, considering the injuries he's sustained."

FEMA: $4 MILLION WORTH OF FOOD STOCKPILED FOR HURRICANE SEASON WENT BAD
Today, officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency confirmed that about $4 million worth of food stockpiled for last year's hurricane season went bad because it was not stored properly.  The agency pre-positioned about $40 million worth of food in the southeastern United States in advance of the 2006 hurricane season as a result of the criticism it received for not being able to get food and water quickly to victims of hurricanes Katrina and Rita two years ago.  FEMA stockpiled enough food to feed a million people for a week.  But, because the agency did not have enough space to keep all the food in its warehouses, it stored some of it in hundreds of trucks. When no major hurricanes materialized, that food -- primarily commercial versions of the military's "meals ready to eat, or MREs -- went bad as the trucks broiled in the sun.  The story was first reported in the Washington Post, today.  A FEMA official said the food that has not gone bad is being given to Seco!
 nd Harvest, a nonprofit organization that feeds the hungry.  FEMA also said changes are being made for this year's hurricane season: officials said the agency will be asking vendors who sell it commodities such as food, water and ice to store them in their own warehouses.  FEMA will then access those supplies and move them when they are needed.

IMUS APOLOGIZES TO RUTGERS BASKETBALL TEAM & THEY ACCEPT
Today, Rutgers University President Richard McCormick said radio broadcaster Don Imus -- who was dropped this week by CBS and MSNBC for inflammatory comments -- apologized to the members of the Rutgers University women's basketball team yesterday.  The apology came during a meeting at the New Jersey Governor's Mansion that included Imus, his wife, Deirdre, the 10-member team, their parents, coaches and administrators, and religious leaders.  Head Rutgers basketball Coach Vivian Stringer said the team accepted Imus' apology and they "are in the process of forgiving."  "We find his statements to be unacceptable and this is an experience we will never forget," Stringer said, referring to Imus referring to members of the team as "nappy-headed 'hos."  Imus made the statements a day after Rutgers lost the NCAA championship to the University of Tennessee Lady Volunteers.
