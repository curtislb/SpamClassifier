The reason ctags doesn't understand --links=no is because these are 
options for exuberant-ctags.  If you have emacs installed you'll 
probably find that ctags is actually a simlink to ctags-emacs-21 or 
similar.  We should probably detect which version of ctags people have 
as part of parrot configuration and then use the one which corresponds 
to exuberant-ctags.

What configurations do people on the list have?  My system is Gentoo 
Linux and I have the ctags package installed which provides the 
'exuberant-ctags' program.  The emacs installation gives a ctags 
simlink to ctags-emacs-21.  Do other people have an exuberant-ctags 
package installed on their system and it actually installs a 'ctags' 
binary?  Or are they all 'exuberant-ctags'?  The reason I'm interested 
is because we might be able to make a small change to the makefile 
rather than the extra work of a new configure step.

Comments most definitely welcome.

Paul
