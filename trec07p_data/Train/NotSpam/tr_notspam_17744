The process is inexpensive and distributed, but it is not "costless".

Consumers pay for their distribution costs when they pay their ISPs
(usually a flat subscription rate). Hosting sites must also make money
in some way, in order to pay for equipment costs. This can be quite
reasonable, but is not "costless".

There are two classes of ways to do this commercially -- various
subscription/fee based schemes (costs charged directly to downloader)
and various advertising-based schemes (costs covered by related
activities which benefit from the same communications channels).

One of the reasons why it is better not to use "non-commercial" licenses
is because they rule out both methods for hosting nodes to make any
revenue from the distribution process, which means that these
distributed costs can't be covered.

Cheers,
Terry
