The term breaking was originally used by Brazil, maybe as early as
2001, during their first threat to issue a CL.  It may be a language
issue.  In some cultures or languages, a patent = a monopoly, so the
CL "breaks" the monopoly.   It can be helpful to point this out, and
to describe the action as leaving the patent intact, but "breaking"
the monopoly, by replacing the exclusive right with a remunerative
right.  Jamie
