Here's an interesting one:

http://thedailyswarm.com/swarm/interesting-idea-ebay-record-label/

Basically, a musician is offering ONE copy of a particular track for sale on
eBay. That track is licensed under BY-NC (I know I know) so the highest
bidder has the right to redistribute the track non-commercially. In this
case non-commercial seems to forbid resale, one of the most common
interpretations of the license provision, but also "commercial
exploitations" which may or may not prohibit the highest bidder from posting
it on an adwords blog.

Anyway, I think its a particularly neat way to co-opt eBay and digital
distribution to handle part of the job of a record company.

Now we just have to wait and see how much the auction goes for (it starts on
June 1st.)

<br><br>Yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only drawback I can see is that it&#39;s no longer &quot;charitable&quot; when<br>they are fed back into the commercial ticketing system, you&#39;d have to create<br>some kind of not-for-profit deriv.&nbsp;&nbsp;Renders the whole thing a bit of a

<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Recording companies pay artists upfront to create<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something new and then charge the consumers per copy; let<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 's have fans pay the artists directly and give them the

<br><br>Agreed.<br><br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve also heard of other schemes where funders are effectively<br>investors.<br>&gt; &gt; So the whole thing becomes like the stock market with share values for<br>&gt; &gt; artists etc.
<br>&gt;<br>&gt; This is effectively no more than a twist on the corporate or partnership<br>&gt; model. Unless there is a Free license involved, what is to stop a sell out<br>in<br>&gt; a few years to the majors? (Leaving the majority of fans no better off

<br>&gt;<br>&gt; That is one option, but I think setting a price at which you will release<br>a<br>&gt; track with a Free license (say CC BY-SA for the sake of argument) is worth<br>an<br>&gt; experiment. If I can get some people together willing to record this way,
