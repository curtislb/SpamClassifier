One of the advantages of the work that Love has done to put the PAC
validation into the kerberos library is that we could potentially
seperate all kerberos processing into a locked-down selinux-protected
special user.  Then the various system tools wanting to do kerberos
would not need the long-term keys, but could still get stuff like the
PAC back, validated.

Likewise, I think a similar tool (achieving the same ideas as the
winbind kinit integration, possibly such as kcm?) could handle all the
kerberos, keeping the user's TGT away from the desktop apps.=20
