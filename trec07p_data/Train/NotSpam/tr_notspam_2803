Has anyone proposed using a bootstrap for Pedro's problem?

What about taking a boostrap sample from x, a boostrap sample from y, take
the difference in the medians for these two bootstrap samples, repeat the
process 1,000 times and calculate the 95th percentiles of the 1,000
computed differences?  You would get a CI on the difference between the
medians for these two groups, with which you could determine whether the
difference was greater/less than zero.  Too crude?

   -Cody

Thanks for your note Thomas.  I do feel that the problems you have
rightly listed occur infrequently and that often I only care about two
groups.  Rank tests generally are good at relatives, not absolutes.  We
have an efficient test (Wilcoxon) for relative shift but for estimating
an absolute one-sample quantity (e.g., median) the nonparametric
estimator is not very efficient.  Ironically there is an exact
nonparametric confidence interval for the median (unrelated to Wilcoxon)
but none exists for the mean.

Cheers,
Frank
