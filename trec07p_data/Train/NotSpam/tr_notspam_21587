9:07 AM, 6/22/07, Update: Forecast calls for possible showers near Kennedy =
Space Center; good conditions at Edwards=20

The Spaceflight Meteorology Group at the Johnson Space Center in Houston is=
 predicting just a chance of showers at the Kennedy Space Center for the fi=
rst opportunity to bring the shuttle Atlantis back to Earth today. But cond=
itions in Florida are expected to deteriorate as the day wears on, with thu=
nderstorms popping up one orbit later.

Commander Rick Sturckow and his crewmates have two opportunities on success=
ive orbits to land in Florida, and three opportunities to land at Edwards A=
ir Force Base, Calif. The first Edwards opportunity comes on the same orbit=
 as the second Florida opportunity and conditions in California are expecte=
d to be "go." But the wind likely will kick up later in the day and it woul=
d appear Sturckow's best chance for getting home today is the first opportu=
nity in Florida or the first at Edwards.

Here's how the forecast shapes up (all times in EDT):


DAY...EDT..........DD...HH...MM...SS...EVENT

Fri  01:12:34 PM...13...17...34...30...KSC: Deorbit on rev 218
Fri  02:18:30 PM...13...18...40...26...KSC: Landing

Forecast: Scattered clouds at 3,000 and 8,000 feet, broken clouds at
25,000 feet; Winds out of 300 degrees at 8 knots with peaks to 13; a
chance of showers within 30 nautical miles.

Fri  02:43:39 PM...13...19...05...35...EDW: Deorbit on rev 219
Fri  03:49:54 PM...13...20...11...50...EDW: Landing

Forecast: Few clouds, winds from 240 degrees at 7 knots with gusts to
11; no constraints

Fri  02:50:31 PM...13...19...12...27...KSC: Deorbit on rev 219
Fri  03:55:00 PM...13...20...16...56...KSC: Landing

Forecast: Winds shift to 200 degrees, 9 knots gusting to 13;
constraint: chance of thunderstorms within 30 nautical miles

The winds at Edwards are expected to pick up as the day wears on, gusting t=
o 27 knots by the third opportunity.
