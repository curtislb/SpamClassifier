Hey Kev, (others)

I am thinking along the same but different lines. (Perhaps the two could be 
combined at some point.)

I am thinking make your music available as an ardour project file. Complete 
multi-track.

Now, I have not experimented enough to know if all the pieces are there yet, 
but what I see is the raw tracks with an official mastering control file 
throught jamin to a final mix, and the stereo mixdown that comes from that.

Then let the fan go hog wild for themselves. Drop a backing vocal and record 
their own and do another mix down. Then their CD that they end up burning 
will really be personalized. Same if they play an instrument.

I was wondering yesterday if you could take one of the Live Audio 
Distributions and stick and ardour project on it and make it boot to a 
playing project... I may try this soon if I can find the time.
