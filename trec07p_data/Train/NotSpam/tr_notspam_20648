As mentioned during today's #parrotsketch meeting, I have 
a number of questions about the specifics of performing
certain operations in the new object model given by pdd15.
These are all generally "how do I...?" types of questions,
where I have something I want to do but in reading pdd15
it wasn't immediately clear to me how to do it.

My first question is "How do I add a class method?" -- i.e.,
a method that operates on a class instance as opposed
to an object instance of that class.  Ideally the answer
would contain explanations/examples for defining such
methods in PIR and also as PMC methods.

More questions to come!
