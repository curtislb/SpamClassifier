You have not told us your OS, but this looks like a x86_64 Redhat-based 
Linux and I will assume their file layout.

If so, this is a known problem with Rmpi, which I reported to the 
maintainer quite a while back.

You do not want --with-mpi=/usr/lib64/lam, as that is not where lam is 
(I presume it is where liblam is).  But there is no means provided to have
includes in /usr/include/lam and library in /usr/lib64/lam, and paths are 
hardcoded into the package.  Note that whoever you are quoting said

>> where /path/to/mpi is such that /path/to/mpi/include /path/to/mpi/lib,
>> etc exists

not lib64, and there is no such prefix on x86_64 Linux.  (Also, that is 
not what configure --help says, and the latter is wrong.)  Beyond that, 
the configure code tests for a static library, and you will need a dynamic 
one on x86_64 Linux to link into libRmpi.so.

If you have not bugged the Rmpi maintainer about this, please do so.

It is possible to hack your own Rmpi/src/Makevars to get this to work, but 
if you knew enough to do that I doubt it you would be asking this (and 
the hack depends on your unstated OS).
