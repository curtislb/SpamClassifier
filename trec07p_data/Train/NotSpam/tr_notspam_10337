Still possible with optional semicolons (as you say later):

 a = 1
 b = \
     2
 c = 3; d = 4

Most of the younger scripting languages didn't.

Your semicolon could also be tabbed way off, so you can't be sure there
either.
"I see no semicolon, so it's likely that the statement continues on the
next line".

No problem I think.

It's exactly as certain as with semicolon termination. See above.

But even if the advantage of line termination is low (some characters
saved, some people might say it looks cleaner), I cannot see any
advantage of semicolon termination.
