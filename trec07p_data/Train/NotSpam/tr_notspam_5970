Assuming Y's improvements involved sufficient creativity to make them
copyrightable, yes.  In the absence of strong evidence to the contrary,
you should assume they do.

Again, you mean "proprietary", not "commercial".  X already has Y's
permission to sell the software commercially, as long as X does so under
the GPL.  X just may not apply a proprietary license to the software
without permission from Y.

Anything sufficiently creative for copyright to exist in it.  You assume
above that Y does hold copyright in the modified version, and if that hol=
ds
true, X would need Y's permission.

For the specific cases you gave, I agree with Andrew Donnellan's assessme=
nts.
