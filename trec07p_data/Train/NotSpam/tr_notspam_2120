+The internal API for package names is always case-sensitive, even if
+the library system is hosted on a system that is not case-sensitive.
+This implies either some sort of name mangling capability or storage
+of intermediate products into a database of some sort.  In any event,
+the actual storage location must be encapsulated in the library system
+such that it is hidden from all language level naming constructs.
+(Provision must be made for interrogating the library system for
+the actual location of a module, of course, but this falls into
+the category of introspection.)  Note also that distributions
+need to be distributed in a way that they can be installed on
+case-insensitive systems without loss of information.  That's fine,
+but the language-level abstraction must not leak details of this
+mechanism without the user asking for the details to be leaked.

 The syntax of a versioned module or class declaration has multiple
 parts in which the non-identifier parts are specified in adverbial pair
 notation without intervening spaces.  Internally these are stored in
