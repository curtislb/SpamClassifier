ALERT OF THE WEEK: TELL CONGRESS WE WANT COUNTRY OF ORIGIN LABELS ON OUR FO=
OD
Concerns over long distance food transportation (food miles) and global war=
ming, compounded by recent food poisoning scandals, linked to contaminated =
pet, poultry, and pig food ingredients from China, have taken away many Ame=
ricans' appetites for cheap imported foods. Shocked at media reports that t=
he U.S. Food and Drug Administration is inspecting approximately one-percen=
t of all imported food, health-minded consumers are demanding that Congress=
 implement mandatory Country of Origin Labels (COOL) labels on food. Federa=
l farm policy theoretically requires Country of Origin Labeling for food. R=
eacting to polls indicating that 80% of American consumers want to know whe=
re their food is coming from, Congress incorporated COOL into the 2002 Farm=
 Bill. COOL was supposed to go into effect in September 2004. Unfortunately=
, corporate agribusiness, Wal-Mart, and the supermarket chains bribed an et=
hically-impaired Congress with millions of dollars to block implementation =
of COOL labels. As a result, Americans are buying billions of dollars of im=
ported foods without knowing it. In order to promote health and sustainabil=
ity, and to save North American family farms, we need to restore our right =
to know where our food is coming from. Tell Congress we want Country of Ori=
gin Labels for both conventional and organic food, and we want it now:http:=

PRODUCT PLUNDER OF THE WEEK: PET FOOD CONTAMINATION MOVES INTO USA MEAT SUP=
PLY
The pet food poisoning scandal that has prompted the largest recall of pet =
foods in history has spread into the livestock and meat sector. This week, =
the USDA admitted that the contaminated food ingredients that have killed t=
housands of pets across the U.S. were also used to feed hogs and chickens t=
hat have already been processed and eaten by several million Americans. Ove=
r three million chickens and pigs have consumed the tainted food. Although =
there have been no government studies done on the toxicity of this contamin=
ation, the FDA claims the risk is low. It?s important to note that organic =
animal feed was not contaminated in this latest incident, underlining the o=
bvious point that pet owners and meat eaters should give preference to safe=
r, more nutritious organic products (find organic pet foods here). Learn mo=
re: http://www.organicconsumers.org/articles/article_5017.cfm

QUICK FACTS OF THE WEEK: MORE REASONS TO BUY LOCAL

* Each year, the average American consumes 260 pounds of imported food.
* 98.7% of foods imported into the U.S. are NOT inspected by the FDA for sa=
fety.
* Of the scant 1.3% of imported foods the FDA tests, over 200 shipments of =
grains, fish, vegetables, nuts, spice, oils and other imported foods are de=
tained each month for issues ranging from filth to unsafe food coloring to =
contamination with pesticides to salmonella. The other 98.7% of untested fo=
od is immediately green-lighted for the American diet.
* The U.S. imports almost twice as much food today as it did just ten years=
 ago, yet the FDA's budget for testing imports has been cut nearly in half =
since 2000.

WEB VIDEO OF THE WEEK: COMEDY CENTRAL PARODIES THE RBGH CONTROVERSY
Comedy Central's Colbert Report takes a hilarious look at the rBGH controve=
rsy. Although the synthetic hormone has been banned in most nations, due to=
 its links to endocrine disruption and cancer, it is still widely used in t=
he U.S.. Monsanto recently filed a formal complaint with the FDA demanding =
that dairies that have banned the use of rBGH should not be able to label t=
heir products as "rBGH-free." Learn more at OCA's "Millions Against Monsant=
o" campaign and watch the short Colbert web video here (Note: Mr. Colbert's=
 humor is irreverent and for adult audiences. Viewer discretion is advised.=

TIP OF THE WEEK: FIVE WAYS TO REDUCE YOUR ECOLOGICAL FOOTPRINT WHEN SHOPPIN=
G
This month's issue of E Magazine includes interviews with leading advocates=
 for ecological shopping, including OCA's Environmental Scientist Craig Min=
owa. Here are five quick tips for becoming a green shopper:

1. Switch to environmentally friendly cleaning supplies. The use of convent=
ional cleaners exposes your family and our environment to some very nasty t=
oxic chemicals.
2. If you buy only one or two organic items, make them milk and meat. Most =
conventional milk and meat are produced on factory farms that feed their an=
imals massive amounts of pesticide and fossil-fuel intensive conventional c=
orn, at the same time creating massive manure lagoons that contaminate loca=
l ground water.
3. Be as conscious about the packaging as you are about the product. The pr=
oduction and disposal of packaging takes a heavy environmental toll. You ca=
n eliminate 1,200 pounds of carbon dioxide (CO2) every year by simply reduc=
ing your waste by 10%. While you're at it, bring your own shopping bags.
4. Buy local and regional, or at least USA-grown, whenever possible, to red=
uce energy and pollution from long transportation. But of course some produ=
cts are not produced in the US.. For overseas products, look for the organi=
c and Fair Trade label.
5. Buy in bulk. If you regularly buy a certain product, consider buying it =
in bulk. It usually has less packaging, is more affordable, and requires fe=
wer trips to the store.

ORGANIC BYTES READERS TALK BACK:

IS THE FDA GOING TO START REGULATING VEGGIE JUICE AND HOLY WATER? QUESTION =
FROM READER: "I'm confused about your stance on the FDA's new Guidance Docu=
ment pertaining to alternative health care products. I've seen an alert fro=
m another group that seems to suggest the sky is falling, but the OCA's sta=
nce in your previous issue of Organic Bytes seems mellow in comparison. Can=
 you please elaborate?"

ANSWER FROM OCA: There is only one group that has launched an alert on this=
 issue, while all other health freedom groups have taken a more reserved st=
ance. After much research and discussion with our allies in the alternative=
 health world, it is the opinion of the OCA that although this FDA Guidance=
 Document deserves attention, it does not change any laws that are already =
in place, and, in fact, serves as a distraction from some of the more impor=
tant issues currently going on in regards to alternative health care regula=
tions. For an in-depth review of this controversy, click here: http://www.o=
rganicconsumers.org/articles/article_4988.cfm

WHY HAVEN'T I RECEIVED YOUR ORGANIC BYTES EMAILS?
QUESTION FROM READER: "I used to get Organic Bytes regularly, but lately it=
 seems to arrive only sporadically. What's up?"

ANSWER FROM OCA: As our Organic Bytes subscriber list has grown larger, we =
have run into more problems with getting blocked by various spam filters. T=
he best way to guarantee you'll receive each issue is to add ronniecummins@=
organicconsumers.org to your email address book. Thanks! Learn more about h=
ow to guarantee Organic Bytes will land in your inbox: http://www.organicco=

ALERT:
IT'S TIME TO PHASE OUT THE POISONOUS PLASTIC PVC
Polyvinyl chloride is the most toxic plastic on the planet, yet it is one o=
f the most widely used plastics in the U.S. The World Health Organization c=
lassifies it as a carcinogen; so many businesses are voluntarily phasing it=
 out. From production to disposal, PVC plastic releases poisonous chemicals=
 that can cause cancer and birth defects. The good news is safer alternativ=
es are available... we don't have to use PVC in our kid's toys or shower cu=
rtains. Unfortunately, Target lags behind Wal-Mart and other major retailer=
s in phasing out this unnecessary and dangerous plastic. Join a coalition o=
f groups from around the country fighting for safe and healthy communities =
at a national PVC Day of Action on May 24th to urge retail giant Target to =
phase out PVC. The May 24th day of action will take place in conjunction wi=
th Target's annual shareholder meeting. Putting together an event is fun an=
d easy, and can be as small as you and a friend or as big as dozens of peop=
le outside of your area Target. We'll help you set it up. Get involved and =
