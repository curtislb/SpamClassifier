6:30 PM, 6/20/07, Update: Entry flight director says Atlantis ready for lan=
ding, weather permitting; MMT holds unusual meeting=20

The Atlantis astronauts packed up today for a hoped-for return to Earth Thu=
rsday to close out a dramatic space station assembly mission. Entry flight =
director Norm Knight said the shuttle's systems are operating normally and =
the only question mark is the weather, with forecasters calling for low clo=
uds and afternoon showers at the Kennedy Space Center.

NASA's Mission Management Team, meanwhile was asked to gather for an unusua=
l night-before-landing meeting to resolve a trio of seemingly minor issues:

*** A final imagery assessment to determine, if possible, the nature of deb=
ris seen floating between the shuttle and the space station after undocking=
 on Monday. Engineers believe the object is of no consequence, but the imag=
e analysis is not yet complete.

*** An aero-thermal assessment to make sure a small bit of unraveled thread=
 that serves as the upper edge of a "gap filler" between an outboard leadin=
g edge panel on the left wing and an adjacent row of heat-shield tiles pose=
s no threat for significantly higher downstream heating during entry.

*** Consideration of a revised analysis of the heat experienced by Atlantis=
' left-side rocket pod during ascent when one corner of an insulation blank=
et peeled back. The blanket was repaired during a spacewalk, but because en=
gineers underestimated how hot the underlying structure got during the clim=
b to space, MMT Chairman John Shannon ordered a final discussion to make su=
re no one had any concerns.

"We're just trying to be completely thorough," Shannon said. "The reason we=
're having an MMT is to make sure everybody understands what assumptions we=
re made, what new data we've learned, what the new thermal assessment is. A=
nd we also have to get the final aero-thermal analysis for that little bit =
of fluff that's on the outboard part of the left wing. We're just going to =
review those, I think we're going to stomp them flat and then we're going t=
o be done with it and be ready to come home."

Weather permitting, of course. As Knight reminded reporters today, "tomorro=
w's the first day of summer, by coincidence, and we know what summer brings=
 to Florida, and that's afternoon thunderstorms."

The Spaceflight Meteorology Group at the Johnson Space Center in Houston is=
 predicting scattered clouds at 3,000 feet, a broken deck at 5,000 feet and=
 overcast at 12,000 feet. Winds will be out of 240 degrees at 8 knots with =
gusts to 13 and thundershowers are expected within 30 nautical miles of the=
 runway. NASA's flight rules require ceilings of at least 8,000 feet and no=
 shower activity within 30 nautical miles.

"So those are going to be our challenges tomorrow," Knight said. "Obviously=
, I would like clear skies, unlimited visibility and little wind. But unfor=
tunately, those are not the cards we're typically dealt. We train to this, =
we're used to this type of environment in Florida. No landing is easy with =
weather."

The Florida forecast does not get much better Friday and Saturday, although=
 ceilings improve a bit. Atlantis has enough on-board supplies to stay in o=
rbit until Sunday at the latest.

"We have consumables that will support out through end of mission plus thre=
e," Knight said. "What that means in English is, end of mission being Thurs=
day, we also have Friday and Saturday as a weather extension day and we kee=
p Sunday open as a systems wave-off day.

"So based on this, our weather strategy going into tomorrow is that on Thur=
sday we're only going to target the Kennedy Space Center and we have two op=
portunities to do that. Friday, we're going to target Kennedy Space Center =
again. However, we may target the Edwards Air Force Base landing site, it w=
ill all depend on the weather, how it looks on Saturday. We'll look at the =
Saturday forecast. If the Kennedy Space Center is still questionable and Ed=
wards is not pristine, then we will call up Edwards on Friday and land the =
vehicle.

"On Saturday, if we still have not landed, we will bring up all three sites=
, this is what we call pick 'em day, and we will target Kennedy Space Cente=
r, followed by Edwards Air Force Base and if we need to, we will land at No=
rthrup (in New Mexico). Don't expect that to happen."

do. If the weather does not cooperate, we'll keep the vehicle safe and the =
crew safe and obviously go around a day."

ecause we're landing at the Kennedy Space Center tomorrow.' That's what we'=
