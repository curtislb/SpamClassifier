By the way, if someone could forward the original question to me (I'm
subscribed to but not currently receiving R-help, as I found I was
spending too much time reading it!) I might think of something more
useful. (alternatively, when was it posted; I can find it on gmane,
too).

Hi Spencer,
I have copied Woody Setzer. I have no idea whether lsoda can estimate
parameters that could take imaginary values.

Hmm. I have no idea.
