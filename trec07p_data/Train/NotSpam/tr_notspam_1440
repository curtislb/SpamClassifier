We're ok for a lot of use cases here. You can install multiple Debian
Desktops and easily setup a dns server and/or web server. New tasks
(and its contents in terms of packages) to cover others use cases is
appreciated.

You're right, but before polish Debian Desktop tasks to be 'Debian
Enterprise Server' aware, we need the second at least in the plans. In
terms of LDAP authentication, it would be good to add such packages
and make sure that the admin can change from regular authentication to
authenticate that desktop through LDAP even if the LDAP server is
running OpenLDAP or Fedora Directory Server in other distribution. To
add this feature we need at least libpam-ldap and a GUI tool to make
the switch. Do you have something in mind for the job?

Talking about the 'shared folders' thing, GNOME has the
Places->Network Servers and Places->Connect to Server. Aren't this
enough? I'm into a mixed environment and it 'just works', I can see
the 'windows network', authenticate and download from their shares.
Actually, I think we lack the ability to the user share through samba
or webdav (remember that apache is overkill here). AFAIK, KDE is in
the same state and Xfce i dunno. Comments?

It would be better cleanup first and work on the 'clean room' for
adding Lenny related content, IMHO.
