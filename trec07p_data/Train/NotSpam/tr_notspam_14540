Enough Is enough, can we leave this thread be now. This just puts people off
posting questions looking for help in fear of joining some flame war.

ugh. pedantic semantics...

yes, the real code is beyond what I would think of as "beginner"
I truly meant to just post a small, working piece pf code that worked with
some basic data structures... The DBI client is a bit more complicated, yes?

The sample I put out and the code I was
working on are not identical. I declared my array in a different scope in
the sample. Neither is "wrong", they are different.

ugh. insults. I am not trying to insulting you Paul, why resort to that?
You have no idea how many programs I've written, well. I'd say its bad form
to assume the worst or lowest in people.

please examine logic - rewriting core Perl docs vs a 10 line sample program

no, I'd suggest you read it that way.. Its notoriously difficult to convey
context and nuance in a few lines of ascii text. Please refer to your RTFM
and then essentially yelling at me for a modest sample program.

I am not backing down from your brow-beating. I posted a small working
sample program then found out more about the context I was dealing with and
attempted to discuss it in an unassuming manner. For this I get these
responses. phooey!

I'll be posting again from time to time, and probably going to OSCon.
Happy
to talk with you anytime. May not respond every time though. I think I am
sensing a pattern here...

best regards
