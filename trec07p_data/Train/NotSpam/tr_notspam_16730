Hello,
    I didn't load any of these modules explicitly.  I notice that when I 
modprobe snd, however, all the problems seem to go away: /dev/mixer and 
/dev/snd/ are created, etc.  I don't know why it didn't do this for me...
    As for mplayer, thanks for the tip.  It's very useful.
Yours,
Zack.
