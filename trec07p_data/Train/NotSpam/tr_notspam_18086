An anonymous reader writes "An article up at the Harvard Business
Review's website by Jonathan Zittrain, one of the founders of the Berkman
Center, discusses how [0]the desire to clamp down on Internet openness
can be avoided. From the piece: 'Those who provide content and services
over the Internet have lined up in favor of "network neutrality," by
which ISPs would not be permitted to disfavor certain legitimate content
that passes through their servers. Similarly, those who offer open APIs
on the Internet ought to be application neutral, so all those who want to
build on top of their interfaces can rely on certain basic functionality.
Generative systems offer extraordinary benefits. As they go mainstream,
the people using them can share some sense of the experimentalist spirit
that drives them.'"

alphadogg writes "Neil Schubert is only partly kidding when he calls
Marriott International's [0]move toward a converged network a horror
story. 'I'm here to tell you a terrifying tale of network design, support
and administration,' he said at an IT conference in Boston, referring to
a major bandwidth crunch caused by guests wielding Slingboxes and other
network devices that overran the hotel chain's outdated network. 'One of
the things we've learned about our guest networks is we have one of the
most foreign, hostile environments known to man in the network
administration world ... I can take 100,000 customers a night on that
infrastructure and we actually have less incidents of harm than we do on
our corporate back-office infrastructure.'"

starkravingmad writes "The Economic Times is running a story on Hindu
nationalists in India threatening to [0]wreck internet cafes that don't
block parts of Orkut that the vigilantes find offensive. From the
article: '"Orkut is used by many destructive elements to spread canards
about India, Hindus, our gods and cultural heritage," said Abhijit
Phanse, president of Bharatiya Vidyarthi Sena, the student group. "We are
gently telling Internet cafe owners that it is their responsibility to
see that surfers do not use their facility to carry out such hate
campaigns ... Or else, we will have to do that job for them." Last week,
dozens of Shiv Sena workers vandalised some Internet centres, saying they
were not stopping their customers from accessing Orkut groups involved in
sending hate messages.'"

An anonymous reader writes "Harvard University celebrated its 356th
Commencement on Thursday. It is tradition at Harvard is to have an
undergraduate deliver a Latin Salutatory address. This year's speaker,
Charles Joseph McNamara, delivered [0]an address all about Star Wars in
Latin! TheForce.net has a write-up of the event, and the speaker was
really hilarious. He apparently [1]doesn't like Star Wars that much, but
it's still awesome. The video is available online, and you too can [2]see
him do a Yoda voice and make light-saber motions ... in front of over
30,000 people. The speech is under "Morning Exercises" on the Harvard
site. The Latin Oration begins at about 1:09:30."

[0]RFC writes "In a move that may be indicative of modern ISP customer
service, Time Warner has announced [1]the introduction of packet shaping
technology to its network. 'Packet shaping technology has been
implemented for newsgroup applications, regardless of the provider, and
all peer-to-peer networks and certain other high bandwidth applications
not necessarily limited to audio, video, and voice over IP telephony.' As
the poster observes, this essentially renders premium service useless.
The company is already warning users that attempts to circumvent these
measures is a violation of their Terms of Service."

[0]Frosty Piss writes "The Seattle PI reports that [1]Google has
complained to US antitrust officials about the hard-drive searching tool
built into Windows Vista, saying that it stymies Google's similar search
program. The complaint, lodged late last year, was revealed Saturday by
The New York Times in a story about [2]the Bush administration's handling
of Microsoft antitrust issues. The real story, though, is not the Google
complaint itself, but how the Justice Department is failing to enforce
the Microsoft anti-trust decree. According to the story, Thomas Barnett,
the assistant U.S. attorney general in charge of antitrust issues, sent a
memo last month to state attorneys general across the nation, seeking to
persuade them to reject Google's complaint."

[0]david.jonathan.russe writes "The school district in Kamloops, BC,
Canada has been working on [1]a linux-based terminal infrastructure for
several years. They now have a system in place district wide and they can
not keep up with all of the requests for info. They have a great hybrid
system, using diskless workstations all booting from local servers. 'The
second-generation system cost the Kamloops district about $47,000 to
implement, as well as the cost of training and the release time for
personal study and taking exams. However, Ferrie has no doubt of the
savings overall. License costs are disappearing as the district phases
out its Novell NetWare licenses, and the district no longer needs to
purchase productivity software. Ferrie also figures that the increased
reliability represents a substantial savings, although he admits that it
is hard to quantify. However, perhaps the greatest benefit of switching
to free software is that the reliability of the new system frees up
technical staff to do more than routine support.'" Linux.com and Slashdot

"Snapped by the probe's Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) as the
spacecraft flew past Jupiter earlier this year, this first-ever "movie"
of an Io plume clearly shows motion in the cloud of volcanic debris,
which extends 330 kilometers (200 miles) above the moon's surface ... The
appearance and motion of the plume is remarkably similar to an ornamental
fountain on Earth, replicated on a gigantic scale.""

The Washington Post is reporting on a finding by London-based group
Privacy International. In a new report, they find that [0]Google has some
of the worst privacy-protection practices anywhere on the web, giving
them the lowest possible grade. "While a number of other Internet
companies have troubling policies, none comes as close to Google to
'achieving status as an endemic threat to privacy,' Privacy International
said in an explanation of its findings. In a statement from one of its
lawyers, Google said it aggressively protects its users' privacy and
stands behind its track record. In its most conspicuous defense of user
privacy, Google last year successfully fought a U.S. Justice Department
subpoena demanding to review millions of search requests."

A News.com story discusses the increasing trend towards [0]adding
metadata to casually created content. Their discussion centers around
vacation photos taken with increasingly sophisticated cameras, and
uploaded to ever more feature-rich websites. These photos, taken on a
whim by snap-happy tourists, become invaluable for people wanting to
follow in their footsteps. "It's the odd juxtapositions of randomly
plotted photos that may be the most surprising--and useful--to travelers
with more obscure interests. For example, fans of graffiti can search the
word, 'graffiti,' and 'New York City' at Flickr.com/map, and pull up
photos of freshly painted tags, all plotted with pushpins on a clickable
Yahoo map. A search for 'Dumbo Brooklyn graffiti,' for example, finds
some 99 photos, including the infamous 'Neck Face' tag, spray-painted on
a brick warehouse at Jay and Front Streets in Brooklyn. Try finding that
in a guidebook."
