Most of the work will be under CC-BY-NC. With some footage etc under a 
Sampling Plus license.

We had a discussion on our forums about it, and stopped short of CC-BY 
to protect the overall work from predatory commercial use. So that's 
not quite the OSD art equivalent. It allows us the flexibility to 
protect and sell some commercial rights, and the Swarm have already 
voted the project as non-profit distributing, so any profits from the 
feature will be rolled into the next one, and building the community.

Other than that, we're going to be as liberal as possible with the 
licensing hence the Sampling Plus license for things like footage 
generated (so for example VJs or short filmmakers can utilise video 
footage in commercial performance works).

OK, this helps. This media gather is for the documentary about the 
project. Not the movie itself. But the next one may well see footage to 
be included in the movie. So I'll be explicit about both these media.

The call for video is here:

Thanks for the feedback, Matt
