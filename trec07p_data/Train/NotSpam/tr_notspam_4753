Today  U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington
D.C. issued a permanent stay of an injunction involving the
infringement of patents owned by Verizon, the phone company.   The
Court allowed Vonage, a company that competes directly with Verizon
to offer Internet based telephone services, to use the Verizon
patents, in return for placing a 5.5 percent royalty into an escrow
fund, while Vonage contests the validity and scope of the Verizon
patents.   Jamie

Vonage Wins Permanent Stay in Verizon Patent Litigation

Company Will Conduct Business As Usual; Continues Adding New
Customers and Serving Existing Ones

HOLMDEL, N.J., April 24, 2007 /PRNewswire-FirstCall via COMTEX News
Network/ -- The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in
Washington D.C. today issued Vonage a permanent stay of a previous
court's injunction that would have barred it from signing up new
customers. Vonage sought the stay following an April 6th decision by
the U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Va. enjoining the company from
using certain VoIP technology to add new customers. The permanent
stay enables Vonage to add new customers as we pursue our appeal.
Existing customers remain unaffected by the company's ongoing patent
litigation.

"We thank the appellate court for its thoughtful consideration of the
merits of our case," said Jeffrey Citron, Vonage chairman and interim
chief executive officer. "It's business as usual for us. We will
continue providing reliable, quality digital phone service at the
best value in the market and connecting thousands of phone calls
every day. We remain focused on growing and strengthening our
business and driving toward profitability."

Citron added, "We continue to believe we have not infringed on any of
Verizon's technology and remain optimistic that we will ultimately
prevail in this litigation."

Vonage will continue to serve existing customers by paying into
escrow a quarterly royalty of 5.5 percent throughout the appeals
process and by posting a $66 million bond as required by the court.
The company's current cash position allows it to pay these fees to
secure the stay as it continues to make progress on and pursues its
legal appeal over the coming months.

Appeal

Vonage remains highly confident in the strength of its legal appeal.

"We believe the original verdict was based on an erroneous claim
construction -- meaning the patents in this case were defined in an
overly broad and legally unprecedented way," said Sharon O'Leary,
Vonage's executive vice president, chief legal officer and secretary.
"We believe the district court's decisions repeatedly neglected well-
established law on claim construction and, as a result, artificially
expanded the coverage of Verizon's patents well beyond what was
intended by the patent trademark process."

O'Leary continued: "We are confident this error will be rectified by
the appeals court, which hears intellectual property cases
exclusively. As a result, we remain highly confident Vonage will
prevail on appeal."
