Forgive me for the duplicate submission, but I was told that this was a
better topic for this list than the general questions list.

I have a user who gets some random disconnects (well not exactly, it is
more like her box goes insane randomly...explained better below).  I was
able to run a wireshark dump on her box and when the trigger action is
performed (running a report) I get a STATUS_INVALID_HANDLE.  

She is in MS Access an runs a report to trigger it (then she gets about
a thousand "disk or network error" dialog boxes).  The action is 100%
repeatable and was not present on the NT4 PDC.

Relevant bits of the dump are available to the interested (but left out
to avoid spamming people).

Any help would be most appreciated!
