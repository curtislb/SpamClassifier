According to a press release (June 16) of Ministry of Foreign Affairs
and Trades, USTR officially proposed revisions to a free trade
agreement between Korea and US.

The proposal is in the form of a revised legal text reflecting New
Trade Policy for Americas, and delivered to Korean government through
US Embassy in Seoul. The revised legal text covers the issues
including labor, environment, pharmaceuticals, essential security,
government procurement, port security, and investment.

According to the release of MoFAT, the affirmation of the Parties'
commitment to Doha declaration on TRIPS Agreement and Public Health is
included. However it is not yet known if other issues such as data
exclusivity, patent extension and approval-patent linkage are included
in the proposal.

USTR hoped dispatching Wendy Cutler next week to explain the proposal
and having re-negotiation with Korea on June 21 to 22 at Seoul.

Automotive, manufactured, agricultural and service markets, which are
said to be addressed in New Trade Policy Details, are not included in
the proposal.
