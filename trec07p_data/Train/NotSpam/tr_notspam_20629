A federal judge in Manhattan today upheld the patent on the anticlotting drug Plavix, good news for the companies that co-market the blockbuster product, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Sanofi-Aventis.
The ruling by Judge Sidney H. Stein of Federal District Court was not unexpected. He had signaled last fall that he tilted toward upholding the patent, which is not scheduled to expire until 2011.
Shares in both companies, however, were up sharply today on the news. Bristol’s stock was up nearly 5 percent in New York, and Sanofi-Aventis was up as much as 2.2 percent in Paris
In addition to upholding the Plavix patent, Judge Stein permanently prohibited the generic manufacturing company Apotex from selling additional supplies of its version of the drug, called clopidogrel bisulphate.
Judge Stein also said he would schedule a hearing to establish damages to be paid by Apotex, which flooded the market with more than $1 billion of its product last fall, drastically cutting into earnings of both Bristol and Sanofi-Aventis. Bristol alone had collected more than $3 billion in Plavix revenue in 2005, making the drug the company’s largest product.
While good news for the brand-name manufacturers, the ruling was bittersweet. Bristol-Myers and Sanofi-Aventis, based in France, had been intent on settling the patent dispute last year, so much so that they negotiated away the right to collect triple damages from Apotex. That will reduce the ultimate amount of any damages.
Apotex, which is based in Toronto, vowed to appeal the decision. In a statement today, the company’s chief executive, Bernard C. Sherman, said he thought the patent would ultimately be held invalid.
Apotex had argued that the drug clopidogrel bisulphate, a salt, was an obvious variation on another older patent held by Sanofi-Aventis. The question of whether scientific discoveries should be obvious to scientists is an issue in patent cases.
But Judge Stein ruled that “Sanofi has effectively rebutted a prima facie case of obviousness by demonstrating that clopidogrel bisulfate — as a whole — possesses unexpected properties that could not have reasonably been viewed as a likely outcome of preparing the invention.”
