Mm.... Kate in the car.

You and I and Rosabel believe.

Kate. I've been thinking about voices and thinking about thinking
about voices... and ...

The Dreaming. I know those songs like a baby knows the word mama. I've
been singing them for approx. 23 years. I know every note and
inflection in that album and it just comes soaring out of me. I don't
have to much think about it, but if I do... it's also lovely. Such
amazing thoughts set to wild expansive music.... sung...
indescribably...

Kate has freed many wild ones on this earth. She has the keys to that
portal where we can roam and prowl unmolested. Unarrested. That's why
she has such a loyal tribe.

Get Out of My House turns me into a demon. I had to talk myself into
enjoying the speed I was doing while driving in. I soooo wanted to
race through Kate's mind and that music in my car on this plane.

I feel secretly, quietly sexy and alive.
