Ah, Zentara was using the base64* method of creating a Tk::Photo.
Base64 is an encoding for a binary file that lets it be used/sent in
places where only ASCII characters are available (i.e. email
attachments).  On most UNIX boxes creating a base64 encoding of a file
is as easy as saying "uuencode -m file".  On XP I am not certain what
the best way is, but, hey, we have Perl so we don't need any stinking
utilities.  Simply install MIME::Base64* and you can convert foo.jpg
into a base64 encoded string by saying:

perl -MMIME::Base64 -e '$/=undef; print MIME::Base64::encode(<>),"\n"' foo.jpg
