It would be illegal syntax currently.

: given $foo { when 1 {...} };
: 
: equivalent to
: 
: given $foo;
: when 1 {...};

Both of these suggestions would seem to duplicate the existing construct:

    $_ = $foo;

:-)

Of course, now someone will argue that unary:<=> should assign to $_ by
default, in which case we'd have to find a new interation operator...
