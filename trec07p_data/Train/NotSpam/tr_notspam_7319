Hiya,
    I got to thinking this morning of a feature of Speakup which, I admit, I've been sort of taking for granted lately.  It's the attribute reading key--speakup+keypad period.
    What I'm wondering about is how, exactly, Speakup gets information on the colors of the console, or of certain text therein?
    This is an issue which seems on the whole to be fairly complicated under a Windows system: I've yet to really find a screen reader which will duplicate it.  I'm wondering, then, how Speakup does it?
Thanks much for indulging me,
Zack.
