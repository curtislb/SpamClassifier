The context of that statement is the GPL as a license, not as a
work. The license, applied to another work, is free.

The GPL as a work, however, is *not* free, since the license on that
work does not grant the requisite freedoms. Surely there's no
disagreement on this?

As discussed, I don't think it does follow; it deserves an explicit
mention.

I believe I've rebutted many of these attempts to dismiss the need for
this, and feel all the more strongly that the change is needed.
