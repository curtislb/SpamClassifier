I have offered the I-APL math language on the devel list as a Sugar
activity. It uses a form of math notation, and is thus not
language-specific, and resides in less than 32K. I control the
licensing on the software, and on a series of math textbooks written
in the language, from arithmetic to calculus. I would be happy to GPL
the language and GDL the textbooks, if I can get some help with
turning the software into a Sugar activity and a few other things.

I also have a copy of an unpublished textbook for teachers on using
the software to teach programming, starting in third grade. I would be
happy to talk to the author about a GDL or Creative Commons license.

What I would really like is the j engine (http://jsoftware.com/), but
Ken Iverson's son Eric won't so far discuss GPLing it. There are only
commercial and freeware versions. J already has the whole math and
graphics thing done up with a bow.
