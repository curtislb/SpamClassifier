REID ANNOUNCES MORE IRAQ VOTES BEFORE JULY 4 RECESS: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Tuesday the Senate will
face another round of votes on the Iraq war before the July Fourth recess, a strategy intended to show that Democrats
are not giving up on efforts to bring troops home. While the measures are unlikely to pass, the announcement comes as
party leaders are under fire by many liberal supporters for passing legislation that funds the war through September.
"We're going to hold the president's feet to the fire," Reid, D-Nev., told reporters after emerging from a closed-door
meeting with Senate Democrats. Under Reid's plan, the Senate will cast separate votes on whether to cut off funding for
combat next year, order troop withdrawals within four months, impose stricter standards on the length of combat tours
and rescind congressional authorization for the Iraqi invasion. The measures likely will be offered as amendments to
the 2008 defense authorization bill, a measure that approves $649 billion in military spending. AP via Yahoo! News:

IRAQ'S ARMY NEEDS AT LEAST 20,000 MORE TROOPS, SAYS U.S. COMMANDER: A senior U.S. military commander said yesterday
that Iraq's army must expand its rolls by at least 20,000 more soldiers than Washington had anticipated, to help free
U.S. troops from conducting daily patrols, checkpoints and other critical yet dangerous missions. Even then, Iraq will
remain incapable of taking full responsibility for its security for many years -- five years in the case of protecting
its airspace -- and will require a long-term military relationship with the United States, said Lt. Gen. Martin
Dempsey, who until recently led the U.S. military's training effort in Iraq. Washington Post: Big Boost In Iraqi Forces
Is Urged http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/12/AR2007061202179.html

"DEADLOCK" IN IRAQI PARLIAMENT: Iraq's political leaders have failed to reach agreements on nearly every law that the
Americans have demanded as benchmarks, despite heavy pressure from Congress, the White House and top military
commanders. With only three months until progress reports are due in Washington, the deadlock has reached a point where
many Iraqi and American officials now question whether any substantive laws will pass before the end of the year. Kurds
have blocked a vote in Parliament on a new oil law. Shiite clerics have stymied an American-backed plan for
reintegrating former Baathists into government. Sunnis are demanding that a constitutional review include more power
for the next president. And even if one or two of the proposals are approved — the oil law appears the most likely,
officials said — doubts are spreading about whether the current benchmarks can ever halt the cycle of violence gripping
Iraq's communities. New York Times: Iraqis Are Failing to Meet U.S. Benchmarks
http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/13/world/middleeast/13benchmarks-iht.html

PRESIDENT BUSH "SCROUNGING FOR VOTES" ON IMMIGRATION BILL: President Bush, once able to easily corral GOP lawmakers to
get what he wanted on Capitol Hill, found himself in an unusual role yesterday: scrounging for votes from members of
his own party. Accompanied by Vice President Dick Cheney, the president made a rare visit to the US Capitol, hoping to
persuade skeptical Republicans to resurrect an immigration overhaul package that many in his party have criticized as
an "amnesty" bill for illegal immigrants. Bush was warmly received at a luncheon meeting -- his first with Senate
Republicans in five years, senators said -- and tried to address conservatives' concerns that the bill is weak on
border security. Boston Globe: Bush presses GOP on immigration bill
http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2007/06/13/bush_presses_gop_on_immigration_bill/

LAT/BLOOMBERG: MOST AMERICANS BACK IMMIGRATION LEGISLATION: Most Americans back a guest-worker program and a proposal
allowing illegal immigrants to become U.S. citizens that were part of legislation the Senate shelved last week after it
failed to gain sufficient support. A new Bloomberg/Los Angeles Times poll shows that at least a plurality of Americans
favors the two most contentious provisions of the bill, the proposal to offer 12 million undocumented immigrants a path
to citizenship and the program for temporary workers. Of a third provision -- a point system for immigrants based on
professional qualifications -- many say they don't have enough information to have an opinion. Moreover, most of those
surveyed appear to reject one of the central arguments deployed by the bill's opponents: The poll finds that less than
a third of all respondents, including Republicans, believe illegal immigrants take jobs away from Americans who need
them. Bloomberg: Most Americans Back Stalled Senate Immigration Bill, Poll Shows

SENATE TO DEBATE RAISING FUEL ECONOMY STANDARDS: The Senate is weighing the first major increase in federal fuel
economy standards since Congress first responded to the oil crisis of the 1970s, part of a new energy bill that
Democratic leaders hope to pass in the next few weeks. The measure would raise fleetwide fuel economy standards by 35
miles per gallon by 2020, up from the 25 miles per gallon average now for cars and trucks. The standards would rise an
additional 4 miles per gallon every year until 2030. But lawmakers must first overcome stiff resistance from U.S.
automakers, who claim the new standards are impossible to meet and could cripple an already ailing industry. Michigan
lawmakers plan to offer amendments to weaken or kill the new fuel efficiency standards. San Francisco Chronicle: Major
increase in fuel standards in the works http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/06/13/MNG88QE8PD1.DTL


MIERS, ROVE AIDES "DEEPLY ENMESHED" IN ATTORNEYS RESPONSE: Several high-ranking White House officials were closely
involved in crafting a public response to the uproar over the firing of a group of U.S. attorneys, according to
documents released late yesterday. Then-White House counsel Harriet E. Miers and aides to presidential adviser Karl
Rove were deeply enmeshed in debates over how to respond to the controversy as early as mid-January, when Sen. Dianne
Feinstein (D-Calif.) questioned the spate of prosecutor departures in a Senate floor speech, according to e-mails that
the Justice Department turned over to the House and Senate judiciary committees. The e-mails are the latest documents
to surface among the thousands of pages provided to Congress in last year's firing of nine U.S. attorneys. Washington

COLEMAN MAY SEE PRIMARY CHALLENGE FROM FORMER ADVISER: An Iraq war veteran and former adviser to Sen. Norm Coleman
(R-Minn.) yesterday said he is considering a primary challenge against the lawmaker in 2008. Retired Lt. Col. Joe Repya
(R) lost a race for the state Republican Party chairmanship last week, after which speculation began to percolate that
he would challenge Coleman. Yesterday, in a statement, Repya confirmed that he is mulling a run. He said he will travel
around the state and talk to people about the viability of a bid during the next two months. "I've received numerous
calls and have been approached by a number of people who have asked me to consider running against Norm Coleman for
U.S. Senate," Repya said. "I am making no decisions at this time. I am going take 30 to 60 days to decide what my
political future is going to be." The Hill: Coleman faces challenge from his former adviser

OVERSEAS VOTERS "UNCERTAIN" THEIR BALLOT WILL BE COUNTED: Over the last six years, the Defense Department has spent
more than $30 million trying to find an efficient way for American soldiers and civilians living abroad to vote in
elections back home. But with the presidential primudles approaching, the Pentagon's system, which is Web-based,
remains slow, confusing and plagued with security and privacy problems. And that has left many of the five million
Americans overseas uncertain that their vote will be counted. Fewer than 20 local election officials in the United
States have said they want to use the military's Web system in the coming election. Just 63 voters used it in the 2006
election to request and return ballots over the Internet, according to a Defense Department study. New York Times:
Casting Ballot From Abroad Is No Sure Bet http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/13/washington/13overseas.html

OBAMA Q2 $$$ VICTORY "WOULD MEAN NOTHING TO MY CAMPAIGN," SAYS CLINTON: Senator Clinton insists she is not worried
about the fund-raising prowess of her chief Democratic rival, Senator Obama, but a recent flurry of campaign activity
suggests she is leaving nothing to chance. On a day when her campaign was touting the endorsement of a prominent
Hispanic senator, making a new appeal for cash, and rallying support among women of color, Mrs. Clinton downplayed the
potential impact of an Obama victory in the next round of fund raising. "It would mean nothing to my campaign. Nothing
at all," Mrs. Clinton declared to reporters yesterday after announcing the endorsement of Senator Menendez of New
Jersey. The former first lady had started to leave the event, but she stepped back to the microphone to answer a
question about Mr. Obama's fund raising. New York Sun: Clinton Is Taking No Chances on Fund Raising
http://www.nysun.com/article/56417

MENENDEZ ENDORSES CLINTON, WILL CO-CHAIR CAMPAIGN: Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton announced on Tuesday that New Jersey
Sen. Robert Menendez will serve as co-chair of her presidential campaign, providing her with a strong link to the
Hispanic community. In a joint news conference, the New York senator said she appreciates Menendez' support and called
him "the embodiment of the American dream." "The support of Latino Americans is especially important to me because
these days require us to bring our country together," Clinton said. Menendez, a Cuban-American and former member of the
House leadership, was appointed in December 2005 to fill the Senate seat of Gov.-elect Jon Corzine. Menendez was
re-elected in 2006, defeating Thomas Kean, Jr., the son of the former Republican governor, in a hard-fought and
expensive race. AP via Yahoo! News: Menendez to co-chair Clinton campaign

OBAMA BACKS OFF PLAN TO PUSH COAL AS ALTERNATIVE FUEL: With pressure mounting on Democratic presidential candidates to
adopt hard-line positions on curbing global warming, Sen. Barack Obama on Tuesday backtracked from his long-held
support for a controversial plan to promote the use of coal as an alternative fuel to power motor vehicles. The
Illinois Democrat made his announcement with little fanfare — in a dryly worded and technical-sounding e-mail sent late
in the day from his Senate office to environmental advocacy groups — and did not mention the issue during an appearance
at a Brentwood gas station designed to shore up his green bona fides with a renewed call to nationalize California's
ambitious goals for reducing carbon levels in fuel. Los Angeles Times: Obama yields to a greener side

FRED THOMPSON'S "RIDE IS STARTING TO GET A BIT BUMPY": Fred Thompson has had a relatively easy ride as he has flirted
with a bid for the Republican presidential nomination. His strategists have found traction promoting him as the heir to
Ronald Reagan -- and a conservative alternative to the top tier of the GOP field. But the ride is starting to get a bit
bumpy. Opponents and their researchers have begun working -- mostly behind the scenes -- to highlight perceived soft
spots in his conservative bona fides. And Thompson will have to neutralize questions on the campaign trail and in the
media about his centrist votes in the Senate, his stances on litmus test conservative issues including abortion and --
perhaps most significantly -- his work as a lawyer and lobbyist. The Politico: Rivals try to deflate F. Thompson
campaign http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0607/4470.html

"SIGNS OF UNRAVELING" IN McCAIN CAMP? Sen. John McCain's presidential campaign is showing signs of unraveling, with a
continuing slide in the polls, voters' irritation over his support of what they called amnesty for illegal aliens and
his decision to pull out of the Iowa straw poll. Party fundraisers say potential McCain donors are hanging back while
Republican voters register rage over the Arizona senator's backing of the immigration reform bill, which was
sidetracked in the Senate last week. The fundraisers say the party's base remains annoyed with Mr. McCain's refusal to
say the McCain-Feingold campaign-finance law was a mistake that hurt free speech and helped wealthy Democratic donors
and that his initial opposition to President Bush's tax cuts was meant to endear him to independents and Democrats.

ROMNEY SPENDING BIG BUCKS ON EARLY ADS: Mitt Romney has stepped up what is already the costliest early advertising push
in a presidential campaign, an effort that his advisers and several media experts credit with helping vault him to the
lead in the Republican field in some recent polls in Iowa and New Hampshire. Mr. Romney, the former Massachusetts
governor, has spent some $4 million on television advertising since February, focusing mostly on Iowa and New
Hampshire, crucial early voting states, according to industry estimates and tracking by an opposing campaign. That
heavy spending comes even though the first nominating contests are at least six months away. He increased his
advertising in a huge way last month, spending more than $2 million, much of it on national cable advertisements. This
month, he added a run of television commercials in South Carolina, another early primary. New York Times: Romney Steps
Up Advertising Push http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/13/us/politics/13ads.html

GIULIANI UNVEILS 12-POINT PLAN; EXPANDING MILITARY #1 PRIORITY: Rudy Giuliani yesterday promised to make the war on
terror, a larger military, and illegal immigration among his top priorities if he is elected President. "We're going to
lay out a mission of doing what other people think are impossible," Giuliani said. "I love that. I love doing what
people think are impossible. Nothing energizes people more than doing the impossible." Speaking at the Old Town Hall,
Giuliani unveiled a 12-point agenda for his Presidency, contrasting his optimism and focus on the future with what he
called the defeatism and despair of Democratic Presidential candidates he said want to bring the country back to the
higher taxes and lower military spending that characterized the Clinton Presidency. New Hampshire Union Leader:
Giuliani vows war on terror, larger military will top list
