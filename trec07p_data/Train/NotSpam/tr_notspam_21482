I'm not sure that it does, but then again I'm not exactly sure what this 
valgrind run implies.

I use the shell alias:

valgrind --suppressions=~/dev/parrot/tools/dev/parrot.supp --num-callers=500 \
    --leak-check=full --leak-resolution=high --show-reachable=yes \
    parrot --leak-test

I find the diagnosis somewhat suspicious, as the call to plan() works like 
most of the rest of Test::More and Test::Builder, but for kicks what happens 
if you trigger GC runs with and without that line?

	.local pmc interp
	interp = getinterp
	interp.'run_gc'()

-- c
