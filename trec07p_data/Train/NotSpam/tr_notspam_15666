Actually, I must take this back; it's almost certain that ftpmaster
did not approve this, because the work when originally included in
Debian (S tar 1.4.3) was only licensed under the GPL [From star.c]:

I'm not entirely sure that it would have been found acceptable had it
gone through NEW with its current license.
