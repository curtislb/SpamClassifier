_randy_64 writes "In a story that ties in nicely with a recent discussion
about the possible reprieve for Net Radio, the Wall Street Journal asks
[0]Can Music Survive Inside the Big Box? The article discusses how the
'big box' stores (e.g. Wal-Mart, Best Buy) are cutting back on space and
acceptance of music CDs. With 85% of music sales still coming from CDs,
maybe this is another thing to push the music industry towards better
online sales models? 'Thanks largely to aggressive pricing and
advertising, big-box chains are now responsible in the U.S. for at least
65% of music sales (including online and physical recordings), according
to estimates by distribution executives, up from 20% a decade ago. Where
a store that depends on CDs for the bulk of its sales needs a profit
margin of around 30%, big chains get by making just 14% on music, say
label executives who handle distribution. One of these executives
describes the shift as a tidal wave.'"

motion sensors that let users detect motion or play action games like
those on the Nintendo Wii console. The D904i from NTT DoCoMo, Japan's top
mobile carrier, contains a tiny motion sensor that detects shaking and
tilting, company spokesman Nobuyuki Hatanaka said. 'The software supports
three main types of motion: shake, rock and roll. Shake can be used for
actions such as rolling dice and shuffling MP3 decks. Rock interprets
right, left, up and down gestures to generate traditional cursor-style
user input commands. Roll offers joystick control by responding to
tilting motions used in navigating games, maps or Web pages.'"

the use of the Presidential Primary Debates on the internet. Some
examples: '5. No excerpts may be aired after 8:30 pm on Saturday, May
26th. Excerpts may not be archived. Any further use of excerpts is by
express permission of MSNBC only. 6. All debate excerpts must be taped
directly from MSNBC's cablecast or obtained directly from MSNBC and may
not be obtained from other sources, such as satellite or other forms of
transmission. No portions of the live event not aired by MSNBC may be
used.' Kevin Bondelli talks about why this is 'shameful and wrong'.
Voters are missing out on the ability to actually have an engaged
conversation about the candidates and their debate performances because
of NBC's greed." [2]Alexander Wolfe at InformationWeek and [3]Jeff Jarvis
at BuzzMachine share similar sentiments, and discuss the matter in
different ways.

rumors or disturbing the social order' — according to the site's terms
and conditions. In China these are all crimes which carry a hefty prison
sentence. Any attempt to post content containing phrases that the Chinese
government doesn't like, such as 'Taiwanese independence', the banned
'FaLun' religious movement or the Dalai Lama, produces the following
message. 'Sorry, the article you want to publish may contain

current head of the nonprofit One Laptop Per Child project, gave analysts
and journalists an update on the OLPC project. Two big changes were
announced — [0]the $100 OLPC is now the $175 OLPC, and it will be able to
run Windows. Even in a market where there are alternatives to using
Windows and Office, there's a huge demand for Microsoft software. The
OLPC was seen as a way for open source Linux distributions to achieve
massive exposure in developing countries, but now Negroponte says that
the OLPC machine will be able to run Windows as well as Linux. Details
are sketchy but Negroponte did confirm that the XO's developers have been
working with Microsoft to get the OLPC up to spec for Windows.' We also
find out that the OLPC gets a [1]price hike and will officially come to
the US. Could this be tied into Microsoft's new [2]$3 Windows XP Starter
and Office 2007 bundle? Now that the OLPC and Intel's Classmate PC can
both run Windows, is Linux in the developing world in trouble?"

Astrophysicist writes "The Astrophysical Journal this week published an
article about [0]the abundance of oxygen in the Sun. Oxygen is the third
most abundant atom in the universe, behind hydrogen and helium. Most of
the hydrogen and helium was formed in the Big Bang, which means that
oxygen is the element most frequently produced by nuclear fusion
reactions in the interior of the stars. The solar abundance of oxygen,
which is key in astrophysics because of its use as a calibration
reference for other objects, was thought to be well established since the
80s. However, recent evidence indicates that it has been overestimated by
almost a factor of two. A revision of the solar oxygen abundance would
have a cascading effect on other important elements, such as carbon,
nitrogen and neon, whose abundance is only known relative to that of
oxygen. In addition to the impact on the chemical composition of many
stars, models of solar interior may require some reworking in order to be
consistent with the new data."

Kelten Miynos writes "According to CNet, the BBC has written a white
paper in which [0]they claim it's possible to double the available
Freeview TV bandwidth by using some clever technologies. 'Doubling the
space would mean we could easily have HD channels on [1]Freeview,
although everyone would need to buy a new receiver and aerial to pick
them up. The key to all this is something called [2]MIMO, which stands
for multiple-input multiple-output. MIMO works using two transmitters,
and two receivers. The two transmitters mean the two sets of data — sent
on the same frequency — will arrive at the receivers at different times.
Different arrival times are what allow the receiver to differentiate
between the two separate signals and subsequently decode them.' These
procedures could then be transplanted abroad to other countries with
similar services."

[0]Billosaur writes "CNN has a report that the Dean of Admissions at MIT
has resigned her post after admitting to [1]lying about her academic
record. 'Marilee Jones, who joined the staff of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1979 to lead the recruitment of women at
the university, stepped down from her post after admitting that she had
misrepresented her academic degrees to the institute, according to a
statement posted on MIT's Web site.' The school had recently received
information about her credentials and the subsequent investigation
uncovered the misrepresentations. Question is, why did it take 28 years?"

[0]NewYorkCountryLawyer writes "In the ongoing case of [1]UMG v. Lindor,
Ms. Lindor has now [2]moved to exclude the trial testimony of the RIAA's
'expert' witness, Dr. Spie Jacobson. Jacobson is the CTO and co-founder
of Palisade Systems, Inc, and a teacher of internet security at Iowa
State, but in his [3]February 23rd deposition testimony she argues he
failed to meet the reliability standards prescribed by [4]Daubert v.
Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and [5]Federal Rule of Evidence 702.
The Groklaw and Slashdot communities participated in both the
[6]preparation of the [7]deposition questions, and the [8]vetting of the
witness's [9]responses."

An anonymous reader writes "IBM, Sun, Novell, and Red Hat all have a very
significant open source element to their businesses. In addition to these
juggernauts, there is growing investment in various open source models.
Will money flowing into open source destroy its roots? Mark Hinkle just
posted an editorial asking the questions [0]Is Commercialization Killing
Open Source? in which he [1]comments on 'opensville' and gives some
actual investment data, and a lot of insight into the growing trend in
'open source commercialization'. Is there such a thing as 'too much
money' when it comes to developing software?"
