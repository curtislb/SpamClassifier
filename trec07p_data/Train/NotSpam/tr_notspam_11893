I very much agree with Drew's statements here.  It's the recording
industry's favourite smoke and mirrors trick to cut hobo shaped silhouettes
for musicians on the assumption that if they can't afford studio time then
they can't afford to eat.

I know a whole bunch of musicians personally who release free music in
various license forms (some copyright, creative commons, even PD) who have
no delusion that they're going to pay their mortgage from the royalties.

Mike's post about the Chinese situation was spot on, they're ahead of the
game because of the "lost cause" nature of the target market.  Yet artists
there still continue to make a good living in such a cd-hostile environment.

I've looked into several possibilities here in the UK.  There's a number of
projects which gain government funding for "charitable work", or "community
work" which benefits others at reduced or no cost.  We have a community
studio locally for instance, I could record stuff there cheaply, or continue
to do as I do now and record stuff in my own home setup.  I'm not sure if a
band could run as a registered charity, though it's an interesting concept
;)

There's a band called The Crimea who are doing something like this already,
they offer the CD for those folks who want something tangible (or high
quality), but also offer their latest album for download completely free of
charge.

They're smart enough to realise it'll benefit them in the longrun, as far as
gigs and promotion goes.  Much like the Chinese situation.

Fans do pay the artists directly, every time they turn up to a gig or buy a
t-shirt, or a high-def DVD surround sound limited edition recording.
There's no reason for the fans to pay for recordings anymore, as The Crimea
point out. The costs associated with writing and recording are a fraction of
what they used to be, and the opportunities for the band to claw back the
investment with merchandising and in the commercial space are massive.

There was another website in the news recently which looked a lot like yours
in concept, I forget the name.  This other website was making a song and
dance (almost literally) about their first artist making a CD from monies
pledged by myspace fans.  I say great, whatever works.  Though when they
finally make their recording it wasn't clear if they'd then give the
recording away for free or start to charge for it.

I've also heard of other schemes where funders are effectively investors.
So the whole thing becomes like the stock market with share values for
artists etc.

I would suggest building into your plan somehow the "beyond music" strategy
of the Chinese, so artists using your site don't expect to make money from
the fans for the music directly.  There should be something else,
merchandising or signed pictures or whatever.

My 2p for what it's worth :)

Best of luck with the venture Brandt! :D

Kevin
