			<p class="storytext">In Tuesday's blog, I wrote that we have no travel plans for Thursday. Well, that changed: We have a day trip to New York City for an interview (care to guess who we are interviewing?) If all goes as planned, Thursday will be a quick trip north to NYC, the interview and a quick flight back to D.C. to do the show live from our bureau.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">As you read this blog, we are "on the road"… headed to Arizona to interview <a href="javascript:siteSearch('Senator McCain');"><b>Senator McCain</b></a>'s wife in their home in Arizona. We hear so much about the candidates even this early in the campaign season (which is now a two-year season). I want to know about the candidates, but I also find it fascinating to see who might be the <a href="javascript:siteSearch('first lady');"><b>first lady</b></a> (or… in '08, I should add, who might be the "first gentleman"?)</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">If all goes as planned, we will fly five hours to Arizona, drive to the McCain home, do the interview, drive back to the airport and fly five hours back to D.C. Everyone on our staff thinks we will make our return flight to D.C. and get back in time to do our 10 p.m. show, but I am pessimistic about this one. I have done the math. I bet we end up in Arizona tonight night… or a guest host pops up at 10 p.m. on our show while we make our way back east. Care to bet?</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Now for some e-mails — and yes, randomly picked:</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext"><strong>E-mail No. 1</strong></p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">I've been wondering whatever happened to the news about the lawyer who went missing and he had left his dog and a hot pot of coffee. He left without a trace and someone had called 911 and hung up from his phone. I was watching it every night and apparently missed a couple of nights and it was never on again. Did they find him? I'd like to know the end of the story. I've tried finding information on the internet but have been unsuccessful.<br />
Thanks for any info you can provide.<br />
<em>D. Hutto</em></p> 
		
			<p class="storytext"><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Like you, I would like to know if there is any news about this lawyer. We check daily and so far… no news. They have not found him. I promise to stay on this story.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext"><strong>E-mail No. 2</strong></p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Dear Greta,<br />
I can't stand Ozzy's music, never could even 30 years ago when I was much younger. But I love Ozzy himself and really enjoyed your interview. And even though I don't like his music, I still admire his talent.<br />

			<p class="storytext">Greta,<br />
Love the show. We are hearing lots about the <a href="javascript:siteSearch('Lindsay Lohan');"><b>Lindsay Lohan</b></a> fiasco. I'm curious… why aren't the clubs that allow entrance and serve alcohol to Lindsay Lohan and other under aged celebrities getting cited, fined or losing their licenses? They are known to be serving alcohol to minors! Isn't that illegal? Can you address this on the show? I have not heard this angle discussed. Thanks!<br />

>From this perspective, contrary it seems to all others, it wasn't Rosie that jump-started or reinvigorated "<a href="javascript:siteSearch('The View');"><b>The View</b></a>," it was and continues to be the coverage of her antics by every other media and news organization that did.<br />

You may not know this about me but I have graduate degrees in physics and engineering. As an expert in these fields I have read everything I can get my hands on regarding the Twin Towers and Building 7. I haven't formed a definitive opinion as yet; however, believe it or not, I am leaning toward all of Rosie's positions. She is much more convincing and scientific than the Popular Mechanics engineers or the scores of professors and researchers I have spoken to in the past few months. However, even though I am tilting toward Rosie, I will reserve final judgment on the subject until I hear the positions of <a href="javascript:siteSearch('Carrot Top');"><b>Carrot Top</b></a> and Gallagher.<br />
Any way you can book Carrot Top and Gallagher on your show to discuss their theories of what happened on 9/11? I, and I'm sure all thinking people, would be very interested in what other great thinkers beside Rosie O'Donnell think.<br />
<em>Jim Greene</em></p> 
		
			<p class="storytext"><strong>E-mail No. 6</strong></p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">To, "On the Record:"<br />
Rosie O'Donnell, when she talked about building 7, Rosie O'Donnell forgot that when the first two towers fell there was a lot of debris that went everywhere and building 7 was to close and built the same way as building 1 and 2. It is also possible that parts of the planes went through building 1 or 2 and hit building 7. I heard that part of one of the planes was found on top of another building. The problem with Rosie O'Donnell is she does not back up her so-called facts.<br />
Now as for Iraq, it is a mute point if the United States should have gone in or not, Iran getting close to having the bomb would have made Saddam try that much harder to get WMD if he did not already have them. If anything the United States troops in both Iraq and Afghanistan have become a buffer to Iran. Back to Saddam, the idea that 9/11 happened made Saddam more dangerous, also Saddam had threatened the United States many times.<br />
For those that think the war in Iraq was all about oil, well the United States could have made a deal with Iraq and get all the oil we wanted however the United States trusted Saddam once and it backfired. The United States backed Iraq in their war with Iran.<br />
Thank you,<br />

			<p class="storytext"><strong>E-mail No. 7</strong> [Accused kidnapper Michael Devlin's apartment is up for rent… we asked last night on the air if anyone would rent it. It is the apartment where <a href="javascript:siteSearch('Shawn Hornbeck');"><b>Shawn Hornbeck</b></a> was held for about 4 years…]</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">With prices these days, of course I would rent it, if I lived and worked in the area and the apartment was in an area relatively safe to live. It is to me the same thing as buying a car from an estate of a dead person. It is empty now and needs someone else to use it.<br />

			<p class="storytext"><strong>• Man who was rescued after 8 hours at sea faces sex charges</strong></p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — A man who jumped from a cruise ship off Florida's coast and was rescued about eight hours later by the Coast Guard, was arrested today on sex charges.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Authorities say 35-year-old Michael Mankamyer of Orlando was being held without bond.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">He is charged with sexual battery not likely to cause injury and lewd or lascivious molestation on a victim older than 12.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">The charges stem from an F-B-I investigation into Mankamyer's fall about 70 feet after jumping from the balcony of his room aboard the Carnival Glory in March.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Mankamyer says he is innocent and did not know why he was in custody. He also declined to speak with investigators, saying he had retained a lawyer. His attorney's name was not immediately known.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext"><strong>• Cleared Duke lacrosse player opts to attend Brown</strong></p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — One of three former Duke lacrosse players cleared of rape charges has decided he will attend Brown University in the fall.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Reade Seligmann says he's looking forward to being a student again.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">The announcement comes a day after the Blue Devils lost to Johns Hopkins 12-to-11 in the NCAA championship game in Baltimore.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Seligmann's attorney Jim Cooney says his client will play lacrosse at Brown. Seligmann, who was a sophomore, was indicted, along with fellow players Collin Finnerty and Dave Evans on charges of rape, kidnapping and sexual offense.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">The season was canceled, and Seligmann and Finnerty, both sophomores, were suspended. Evans, who is from Bethesda, graduated the day before he was indicted.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Seligmann says he appreciates the support and loyalty of his teammates at Duke. He says he'll miss them and hopes they'll understand why he needs to go elsewhere.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext"><strong>• Fitness vibration plates popular but may be risky, experts say<br />
</strong>By CARLA K. JOHNSON<br />
Associated Press Writer</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">CHICAGO (AP) — What if you could burn fat while shaking a martini?</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Actually, it's your body that shakes like a martini on a new type of fitness machine that's generating lots of buzz and celebrity use. Even NASA has tested the concept.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">These machines use vibrations to tone muscle and claim to do it faster. Aggressive promoters also say the equipment improves flexibility and strength, reduces pain and stress, builds muscle and reverses osteoporosis.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">However, researchers warn of possible injuries ranging from back pain to cartilage damage. One even warns that the high-powered jiggling might harm the brain. They say the science is thin and too little is known about the long-term effects of such powerful vibrations.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Still, NASA is studying vibration as a possible tool for reducing muscle atrophy and bone loss during astronauts' long, weightless trips in space.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">And users of the equipment love the sensation and the quick workout. Workout times are reduced by two-thirds, advocates say, a claim that appeals to busy professionals, mothers of young children and just about anyone who shuns exercise.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">"I feel kind of tingly and a little like I got off a ship, kind of shaky but in a good way," said Amy Allen, a 40-year-old working mom in Chicago, after a 25-minute workout on the Power Plate, one of the higher-end brands. "I'm hoping this is the solution to help me get that extra weight off."</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">The Power Plate vibrates 20 to 50 times a second in three directions, increasing g-forces on the body, and according to the Northbrook, Ill.-based company of the same name. The company says that raises the effectiveness of lunges, squats and other exercises done while standing on it.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">The workout is not aerobic; it's more like weightlifting without weights.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">"You don't really feel like you're working that hard, but then you get that sweat going and once the vibration stops, you can really feel it in your legs or upper body," said Michaela Zakheim, 45, who uses the machine at a fitness center in her Lincoln Park neighborhood.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Power Plate sells models for home and gym at prices ranging from $3,000 to $10,500. Motors in the base make a low humming noise. Controls adjust the duration and intensity. The machines weigh 264 to 500 pounds and have handles to hang onto.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Fitness trainers love them, but some users don't like the fact they can't read or watch TV while working out on them, said Craig Bradley, general manager of Holmes Place, an upscale Chicago health club that has four Power Plates. Doubts also stem from memories of the belt vibrators popular 50 years ago.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Others have been won over though.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">"I think the machines are as good as the imagination of the person using them," Bradley said.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Dozens of companies have entered the market, including Soloflex which has sold more than 30,000 of its $295 vibrating, skateboard-like, handle-free platforms in less than three years, said Jerry Wilson, the Hillsboro, Ore.-based company's CEO and founder.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">"We get reports back that it helps people with incontinence," Wilson said. "Their aches and pains have gone away. They're stronger. They sleep better. It has basically the same effects as if they'd started an exercise program."</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">A study at NASA's Johnson Space Center showed that the use of a vibration platform during exercise squats made muscles work more, but it didn't look at whether vibration makes athletes run faster or jump higher.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">"Vibration works... but we're still trying to figure out how to use it best and I think we're a number of years away before we do that," said Bill Amonette, one of the study authors and a fitness expert at the University of Houston-Clear Lake. "I think we have to be cautious of some of the claims. ... With aggressive marketing, sometimes they claim things that aren't necessarily true."</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Some researchers are also concerned that high-amplitude vibration can be dangerous over time since it can send jarring waves throughout the body, said Andrew Abercromby, another researcher at Johnson Space Center.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">"I believe, and I think quite a few other people believe, the jury is still out on it," Abercromby said.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Clinton Rubin, a biomedical engineering professor at State University of New York at Stony Brook, said he has asked Power Plate to stop citing his research in its promotional materials. His work has led to a vibration device before the Food and Drug Administration approval for prevention and reversal of bone loss from osteoporosis, but that device uses much gentler vibrations than Power Plate, Rubin said. He believes the Power Plate's vibration levels could cause low back pain, cartilage damage, blurred vision, hearing loss and even brain damage.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">"I think they are cavalier in dismissing the dangers of chronic exposure," he said. "I'm a scientist. I worry that people are going to use this device based on a misrepresentation of science."</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Power Plate warns pregnant women and people with retinal detachment, blood clots, bone tumors and other medical conditions not to use the machines.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Soloflex recommends using its device only 30 minutes a day because too much use would exceed industry standards for safe vibrations in the workplace. (The Occupational Safety and Health Administration doesn't set safety levels for fitness equipment, an agency spokesman said.)</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">"I own a steel factory so I know whole body vibration has allowable exposure limits," Wilson said. "But too much aspirin is bad for one too."</p>
