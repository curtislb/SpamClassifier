Hello Matt,

My name is Aelaf Worku, and I am interning with James Love at KEI/CPTech.  I am writing to you today because you were referred to me as someone with insight with regards to my project.  I am working on a signature list to expand the WHO's Essential Medicines List to include more patented drugs.  I was having trouble, however, locating appropriate contacts.  As a medical student, I wanted to target faculty or student groups associated with public health, medical, or pharmaceutical schools.  So far I have contacted AMSA, e-drugs, Caroline Gallant at UAEM, ip-health as well as some individuals.  If you could recommend some others, I would appreciate it. Thanks.

Sincerely,
Aelaf Worku

Dear Pharmacy, Public Health, Medical Students and Faculty,

The following is a letter we are circulating for signatures, asking the WHO to expand it's model Essential Medicines List, to include a category for products that would be included, "if available at generic prices." Right now, there are only 16 patented medicines on the EML, all but two of which are for treatment on one disease -- AIDS.   We want to give this letter to members of the WHO's governing body the week of May 14. If you are willing to sign, send your name and medical school affiliation to:

fix.the.who.eml@gmail.com

Aelaf Worku, Medical Student ,The Mount Sinai School of Medicine

Please circulate for signatures until May 12, 2007.


Open Letter to the World Health Organization Intergovernmental Working Group on Public Health, Innovation, and Intellectual Property

We, the undersigned students and faculty of pharmacy, public health and medicine, are writing to request a specific reform in the composition of the World Health Organization's (WHO) model  Essential Medicines List (EML).   This reform is necessary to implement the mandate set out in a variety of World Health Assembly resolutions concerning the need to expand access to medicines.  We are deeply familiar with the importance of medications in safeguarding the health of patients.  New drugs continue to elevate the standard of care for countless diseases and extend and improve lives.  Ensuring that our future patients and patients everywhere, have access to these medications is of the utmost concern.  To this end, we applaud the February 7, 2007 statement of WHO Director General Dr. Margaret Chan that "WHO unequivocally supports the use by developing countries of the flexibilities within the TRIPS agreement that ensure access to affordable, high quality drugs."

We are concerned, however, that the WHO's EML does not fully reflect this support.  WHO evaluates whether medicines are sufficiently cost effective for inclusion in the list on the basis of current market prices, ignoring lower generic prices available to countries that employ patent flexibilities supported by WHO.  As a result, of the 312 medicines on the list, only 16 are newer patented drugs, including 14 for the treatment of AIDS.  Not a single patented drug for a non-communicable disease is included –not for cancer, not for diabetes, not for ischemic heart disease.  This is despite the fact that non-communicable diseases are the leading cause of mortality in low-income countries, and that many new drugs offer substantial improvements in the treatment of non-communicable disease.

The existence of a WHO "Essential Medicines List" which does not contain a single patented medicine for non-communicable diseases provides rhetorical cover for those who oppose public health exceptions to patent laws and who argue that patients in developing countries should not expect treatment for "Western" diseases.  The current list also offers little guidance to developing countries exploring legal, WHO supported options for obtaining drugs at lower cost.

For these reasons, we ask the WHO Intergovernmental Working Group on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property to support a change in the EML that is consistent with WHO's support for the use of TRIPS flexibilities.  As proposed in a March 2, 2007 request by Knowledge Ecology International, the WHO EML should include a category for medicines that would be included in EML "if available at generic prices."  This change in the EML list would avoid sending mixed signals on the legitimacy of patent flexibilities and the medical importance of patented drugs.  It would provide developing country Health Ministries with invaluable information to more effectively negotiate drug prices and make informed decisions on the use of compulsory licensing.  Finally, such a list would no longer exclude many of the most effective drugs for millions of patients in developing countries who suffer from non-communicable diseases.

As teachers and students of medicine and health, we are firmly committed to the WHO's mission of "the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health."  Creating an EML that supports developing countries striving to achieve the highest standard of care for all patients would be a vital step towards achieving that goal. We urge the Intergovernmental Working Group to incorporate this proposal into its Global Strategy and Plan of Action.
