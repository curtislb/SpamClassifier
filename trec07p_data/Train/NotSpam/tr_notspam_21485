jcgam69 writes "A federal judge in New Mexico has [0]put the brakes on
the RIAA's lawsuit train, at least in the US District Court for New
Mexico. The case in question is part of the RIAA's campaign against
file-sharing on college campuses and names "Does 1-16," who allegedly
engaged in copyright infringement using the University of New Mexico's
network. In a ruling issued last month but disclosed today by
file-sharing attorney Ray Beckerman, Judge Lorenzo F. Garcia denied the
RIAA's motion to engage in discovery. This means that the RIAA will not
be able to easily get subpoenas to obtain identifying information from
the University."

*SECADM writes "Learning from Microsoft's error, [0]Google is building a
lobbying power house in Washington." From the Washington Post article:
Two years ago, Google was on the verge of making that Microsoft-like
error. Davidson, then a 37-year-old former deputy director of the Center
for Democracy & Technology, was the search-engine company's sole staff
lobbyist in Washington. As recently as last year, Google co-founder
Sergey Brin had trouble getting meetings with members of Congress. To
change that, Google went on a hiring spree and now has 12 lobbyists and
lobbying-related professionals on staff here — more than double the size
of the standard corporate lobbying office — and is continuing to add
people.

EULA-based ban on the virtualization of Vista Basic and Premium, only to
cancel the announcement at the last minute. The company reached out to

"user choice" before pulling the plug, apparently clinging to security
excuses. From the article, "The threat of hypervisor malware affects
Ultimate and Business editions just as much as Home Premium and Basic. As
such, the only logical explanation is that Microsoft is using pricing to
discourage users from virtualizing those OSes. Since when is a price tag
an effective means of combating malware?" Something else must be going on
here."

accurate ink-jet printers are when they report that cartridges are empty.
Not very, it turns out. Epson came out on top of the study (and Ars
rightly questions how objective it was, given that Epson paid for it),
but even they waste 20% of the ink if users take the printers' word for
when to get a new cartridge. On average, the printers in the study wasted
more than half the ink that users bought.

Yesterday we discussed [0] Manhunt 2's AO rating, and what it meant for
the game's retail outlook. Gamespot points out that effectively an AO
rating means that [1]the game will never be released in the first place.
"Both [Nintendo and Sony] forbid licensed third-party publishers from
releasing games rated AO for Adults Only on their various hardware
platforms. Though Manhunt 2 isn't slated for any of Microsoft's systems,
the company has also confirmed that it does not allow AO-rated titles on
the Xbox or Xbox 360. The sole exception to this rule was in 2005 when
the already released Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas was retroactively
rated AO, at which point retailers pulled it from shelves and Take-Two
suspended production of the game."

Strudelkugel writes "The New Yorker has a book review describing [0]our
common misunderstanding of the value of technology and its ultimate uses.
The reviewer notes that the way we think about technology tends to ignore
older objects of technology. Quoting: '[W]hen we do consider technology
in historical terms we customarily see it as a driving force of progress:
every so often... an innovation — the steam engine, electricity,
computers — brings a new age into being. In "The Shock of the Old:
Technology and Global History Since 1900", by David Edgerton, a
well-known British historian of modern military and industrial
technology, offers a vigorous assault on this narrative. He thinks that
traditional ways of understanding technology, technological change, and
the role of technology in our lives, have been severely distorted by what
he calls "the innovation-centric account" of technology.'" Money quote:
"Seen in this light, my kitchen is a technological [1]palimpsest."

[0]Spamicles writes "The guys over at the Pirate Bay have launched a new,
[1]censorship-free image hosting website called [2]BayImg. Users of the
new service don't have to sign-up in order to upload images. However,
they can assign a 'removal code' to uploaded images, in case they want to
delete the files after a while, and tags to categorize images. BayImg
currently supports 100+ file formats, and supports uploading Zip and Rar
archives. The maximum file size of uploads is 100MB. The article also
discusses TPB's plans for launching a video streaming service that will
potentially compete with YouTube."

An anonymous reader writes "Last week's House Appropriations Subcommittee
for Commerce, Justice, and Science FY08 budget markup would prevent work
on programs devoted to human missions to Mars. According to a House
Appropriations Committee [0]press release, the markup language states
that NASA cannot pursue "development or demonstration activity related
exclusively to Human Exploration of Mars. NASA has too much on its plate
already, and the President is welcome to include adequate funding for the
Human Mars Initiative in a budget amendment or subsequent year funding
requests." The Mars Society is already leading an [1]effort to get the
language removed."

[0]ElvaWSJ writes "In preparation for its exclusive launch of the
cellphone industry's most anticipated device, [1]AT&T is pulling out all
the stops. It is adding about 2,000 temporary employees to cope with the
influx of shoppers in the first few months. And it is planning for
enhanced security to control the potentially large crowds and avoid theft
of the phones, which will go for a steep $499 or $599, depending on
memory capacity. Some sales agents expect to see people camping outside
the night before. 'Apple, which plans to start selling the phone in all
of its 162 retail stores on June 29, did not disclose any plans around
training or staffing for the launch. Apple will also start selling the
phone online on the launch date, but AT&T will first launch only in its
stores ... AT&T, which is requiring iPhone shoppers to sign up for a
2-year contract, has not yet revealed the service fees it will charge
iPhone customers.'"

Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is experimenting with [0]reforming
the way patents are applied for and processed. Launched on 18 June 2007
was an Internet-based peer-review program whereby anyone (even you) can
help to evaluate a number of software patent applications voluntarily
submitted for public evaluation. The one-year pilot Peer-to-Patent
program is a collaboration between the USPTO and New York Law School's
Institute for Information Law and Policy, in New York City. The program's
[1]Web site allows users to weigh in on patent applications by
researching, evaluating, submitting, and discussing prior art, which is
any existing information, such as articles in technology journals and
other patents, relevant to the applicant's claims."

[0]JonRob writes "The Open Rights Group has released a report on
[1]challenges faced by voting technology. Using the May 2007
Scottish/English elections as a testbed, researchers have collated
hundreds of observations into a verdict on voting in the digital age.
'The report provides a comprehensive look at elections that used
e-counting or e-voting technologies. As a result of the report's findings
ORG cannot express confidence in the results for the areas we observed.
This is not a declaration we take lightly but, despite having had
accredited observers on location, having interviewed local authorities
and having filed Freedom of Information requests, ORG is still not able
to verify if votes were counted accurately and as voters intended.' The
report is [2]available online in pdf format for download."

An anonymous reader writes "According to a CNet article, an incredible
one in three people aged 16 to 24 in the UK would [0]not give up their
mobile phone for a million pounds. 'The phone-centric survey, called
Mobile Life, was carried out across the UK and questioned 1,256 people
aged 16 to 64 on a variety of topics ... So young people really like
having a mobile phone and we all love buying gadgets. But before you
dismiss this research as stating the bleeding obvious, think about this
-- if someone had told you even ten years ago that people would be taking
out second mortgages to buy flat screen TVs, would you have believed it?'
Is this just the result of deliberately skewed marketing dressed up as
research, or is this another indication of western culture's obsession
with communication and technology? How much is too much tech?"

corporate radio giants and NPR, claiming that small community stations
