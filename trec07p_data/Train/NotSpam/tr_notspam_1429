Since the lm.ridge function does not have a weights argument, here are a
couple of alternatives:

1:  The lasso does something along the same lines as ridge regression
and the l1ce function in the lasso2 package has a weights argument, you
could try that approach and see if it gives you want you want.

2:  Standard regression solves the matrix equation (x'x)b = x'y for b,
weighted regression solves the equation (x'Wx)b = x'Wy for b where W is
the matrix of weights (diagonal matrix for wls, covariance matrix for
gls).  Now if you have a matrix w such that w'w = W (just the square
root of the weights if using the diagonal matrix) and you define x* = wx
and y*=wy, then if you do regular regression (ols) on y* and x* you get:

(x*'x*)b = x*'y* => ( (wx)'(wx) ) b = (wx)'(wy) => ( x'w'wx )b = x'w'wy
=> (x'Wx)b = x'Wy 

Which is the weighted least squares (wls).  So doing a regular
regression on y* and x* gives a weighted regression, so it would stand
to reason that doing a ridge regression on y*=wy and x*=wx would give
something along the lines of a weighted ridge regression (I am not an
expert on ridge regression, so I don't know if there are any hidden
traps to this approach).

Hope this helps,
