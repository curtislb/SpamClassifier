Dear debian-legal,

The license is below.  Is it good enough for Tommi Inkila's FoF music
to be uploaded to non-free?


== How it was made ==

Tommi mailed me privately, and told me he and his teammates
would prefer that the license allow use of the music in FoF only, not
in derivatives.  I tried to convince him why allowing forking is good,
and he understands, but he still prefers to keep it this way for now.
So I think we should try to get the upstream music in Debian as-is for
now instead of bothering upstream more.  If someone wants to fork FoF
and use the upstream music, they should take it up with upstream
themselves.

So, I took http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd-nc/1.0/legalcode
and made some changes.  For example, I changed "Creative Commons Legal
Code" to "Restricted Media Legal Code".  I didn't use the name "Frets
on Fire" there since I don't want people to think the license applies
to the whole game.  It is only for Tommi Inkila's music.  As another
example, I removed the trademark-related text.  I hereby release the
new license text to the public domain.  A diff of the original and new
licenses, and a paste of the new license in its entirety, follow.

And so I ask you, dear debian-legal: Is the new license good enough
for Tommi Inkila's FoF music to be uploaded to non-free?  If it's OK,
then we can kindly ask upstream to look over it themselves then send
it to Teosto for approval.

Regards,
Jason

INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. THE AUTHORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES
REGARDING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
RESTRICTED MEDIA PUBLIC LICENSE ("RMPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS
PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE
WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND
AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS
YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF
SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions
 a. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue,
    anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in
    unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions,
    constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are
    assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
    Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as
    defined below) for the purposes of this License.
 b. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the
    Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical
    arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture
    version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,
    condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
    transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a
    Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the
    purpose of this License.
 c. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work
    under the terms of this License.
 d. "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the
    Work.
 e. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under
    the terms of this License.
 f. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
    License who has not previously violated the terms of this License
    with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission
    from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a
    previous violation.
 g. "The Game" means the game Frets on Fire.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce,
limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or
other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under
copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
    Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
    Collective Works;
 b. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
    publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
    transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective
    Works;

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by
Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
    publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this
    License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
    Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the
    Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
    publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
    on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or
    the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may
    not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that
    refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may
    not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
    digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that
    control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with
    the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work
    as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require
    the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject
    to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work,
    upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
    remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or
    the Original Author, as requested.
 b. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3
    above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed
    toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The
    exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of
    digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be
    intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private
    monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any
    monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of
    copyrighted works.
 c. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
    digitally perform the Work or any Collective Works, You must keep
    intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original
    Author credit reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing
    by conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original
    Author if supplied; the title of the Work if supplied. Such credit
    may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however,
    that in the case of a Collective Work, at a minimum such credit
    will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears
    and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable
    authorship credit.
 d. You may not publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
    digitally perform the Work except as part of the Game and you may
    not distribute the Work except with the intention of it being used
    with the Game.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 a. By offering the Work for public release under this License,
    Licensor represents and warrants that, to the best of Licensor's
    knowledge after reasonable inquiry:
      i. Licensor has secured all rights in the Work necessary to
         grant the license rights hereunder and to permit the lawful
         exercise of the rights granted hereunder without You having
         any obligation to pay any royalties, compulsory license fees,
         residuals or any other payments;
     ii. The Work does not infringe the copyright, trademark,
         publicity rights, common law rights or any other right of any
         third party or constitute defamation, invasion of privacy or
         other tortious injury to any third party.
 b. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS LICENSE OR OTHERWISE AGREED IN
    WRITING OR REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE WORK IS LICENSED ON AN
    "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING
    THE CONTENTS OR ACCURACY OF THE WORK.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, AND EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM LIABILITY TO A
THIRD PARTY RESULTING FROM BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES IN SECTION 5, IN
NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination
 a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
    automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
    Individuals or entities who have received Collective Works from
    You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
    terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
    compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
    survive any termination of this License.
 b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted
    here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in
    the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right
    to release the Work under different license terms or to stop
    distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
    election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
    license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the
    terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
    force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous
 a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or
    a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license
    to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license
    granted to You under this License.
 b. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
    of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further
    action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
    reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision
    valid and enforceable.
 c. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
    breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
    writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or
    consent.
 d. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
    with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no
    understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the
    Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any
    additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
    You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written
    agreement of the Licensor and You.

The authors of this License are not party to this License, and make no warranty
whatsoever in connection with the Work. The authors of this License will not be
liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages
whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special,
incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this
License. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if the authors
of this License have expressly identified themselves as the Licensor
hereunder, they shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.
