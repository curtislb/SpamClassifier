I understand.  My impression was that there was a claim that the
exemption had to be removed for all files, not just the problematic
ones.  So I tried to allay that particular concern.

Make Bacula use GnuTLS.  Unfortunately, that may take some effort.
Downloading the 2.0.3 release, it seems that bacula uses the headers

<openssl/ssl.h>
<openssl/evp.h>
<openssl/x509v3.h>
<openssl/rand.h>
<openssl/err.h>
<openssl/asn1.h>
<openssl/asn1t.h>

According to this page

  http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/comparison.html

GnuTLS + libgcrypt + libtasn1 implements everything unless you need
ECC.

Michael Poole gave a good answer.
