Hi Guys,

We are involved in a similar experiment in India. Its called TempoStand
www.tempostand.com where we are using CC BY-SA. We had a tough time
explaining people the importance of free music but we managed to impress
over 30 bands. We will be soon releasing our first album, the first CC album
in India. It will cover 8 artists and over 1.5 hours of music. classical,
sufi, ghazals and some instrumentals. We are recording music for free for
these bands and they seem to be understanding the philosophy behind CC.
TempoStand is also into merchandise, organising shows, selling music. I am
sure strayform will do great.

Cheers,
Ujjwal Grover
