today one of Russell's online articles was about the report of a
parlementary committe who wants to mix qand match more "IP' rights,
having been told these are a good thing by the RIAA canada, the MPAA
canada, Microsoft and Microsofts Astroturf squad.

I do think that the trademark issue needs to be trated carfully.

On one hand thademarks are the one "IP" issue that had an upside for
consumers.  IF I see for example "HP" CDR disks, or "panasonic"
batteries, or "NGK" Sparkplugs, I can have some assurance that the goods
will probaly be of a quality that I have found acceptable for my use in
the past.

Makers sometimes see simalar products in different markets at differing
prices, and in most cases the underlying goods have the same technology.

Crafty Business folks sometime take advantage of this and for example
sell me "reaL" goods that were actually inteded to be sold in say
Brazil, or perhaps Australia.  These are called "grey Market" imports
and are generaly NOT appreceated by the Candian "official" importer.

Perhaps - since the report seems to come close to attempting to lump
this market in with the real scum folks who would pass off JUNK as a
brand name product.  there may be an argument to point out that the
advice the committe has received was lead by the self interest of the
"witnewsses" rather than the interest of thehLegitamate consumer.

My own personal opinion thought about and written at home on my own time
and all that
