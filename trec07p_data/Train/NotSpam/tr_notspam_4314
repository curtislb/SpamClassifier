Ravi,

Thanks a lot for your detailed reply. It clarifies many of the confusions in my mind. 

I want to look at the parameter estimates at each iteration because the full model that I am trying to estimate is not converging; a smaller version of the model converges but the results are quite meaningless. The problem in the estimation of the full model is the following: my likelihood function contains the elements of a (bivariate normal) covariance matrix as parameters. To compute the likelihood, I have to draw random samples from the bivariate normal distribution. But no matter what starting values I give, I cannot ensure that the covariance matrix remains positive definite at each iteration of the optimization exercise. Moreover, as soon as the covariance matrix fails to be positive definite, I get an error message (because I can no longer draw from the bivariate normal distribution) and the program stops. Faced with this problem, I wanted to see exactly at which parameter estimates the covariance matrix fails to remain positive definite. From that I would think of d
evising a method to get around the problem, at least I would try to.  

Probably there is some other way to solve this problem. I would like your opinion on the following question: is there some way I can transform the three parametrs of my (2 by 2) covariance matrix (the two standard devaitions and the correlation coefficient) to ensure that the covariance matrix remains positive definite at each iteration of the optimization. Is there any method other than transforming the parameters to ensure this?
