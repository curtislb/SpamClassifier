Hi Bill,

Thanks for your reply.  The first place I looked was in
the survival package since it can obviously handle 
censored data.  However, I don't have any particular desire
to restrict myself to standard survival models just because
I have some censoring.  Frailties appear to fit in nicely
with the types of models typically used with survival data,
but that's not the only kind of model I'd like to look at.

Thanks,
Spie
