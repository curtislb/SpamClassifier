And lets rename Perl to Python. This is just change for the sake of change.

Dict also makes it sound like you are talking about pornography.  Of
course, hash makes it sound like you are talking about getting high.

Please provide the peer-reviewed study that proves this as it goes
against my experience.

The Perl 5 people are already annoyed that . is changing to ~, sigils
are becoming invariant, etc.  Why not change the name of one of the
data structures too?  If we give them too many things to complain
about they won't be able to decide where to start!

They may be the same number of characters, but I can type hash without
leaving the home row on QWERTY keyboards, I don't know about Dvorak.

snip

Right, because dictionaries have keys and values not terms and
definitions.  Of course, it all makes sense now.

snip

Except of course those poor schmucks who foolishly wrote code like

if (ref $arg eq 'HASH') { ... }
