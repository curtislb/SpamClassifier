as an attempt to suggest something more helpful than "do write the
compressor yourself if you have a problem with pdf()":

as you are using MacOS X, you'll have ghostscript installed anyway. so
try in R `dev2bitmap' with `type =pdfwrite'. I believe `gs' _does_
include compression. a quick test showed at least a reduction by about
a factor of 2 relative to `pdf()'. probably one can fiddle with the
ghostscript settings (cf. e.g. `Ps2pdf.htm' in the ghostscipt docs: you
can adjust the resolution for images in the pdf file) to
improve this, so as a last resort you could indeed export the graphics
as postscript and do the conversion to `pdf' by adjusting the `ps2pdf'
switches. but even with the default settings the pdf produced via
dev2bitmap/ghostscript is the better solution. apart from file size I
by and then ran into problems when converting `pdf()' output to
postscript later on, for instance.

hth,
joerg
