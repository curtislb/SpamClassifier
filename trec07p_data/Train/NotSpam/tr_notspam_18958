I watched some of it. They talked a lot about how it helps the film 
production industry, even though it has no effect on Hollywood films 
produced in Canada. It would have a small effect on Canadian films, but 
I wouldn't be surprised if the filmmakers are happy to have anyone watch 
their films, even if they are illegally copied.
