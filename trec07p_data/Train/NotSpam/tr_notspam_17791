Garrett,

I have a question about openwrt.  I have a linux box that needs to go out on
the Internet and I am getting two wrt54G v2 routers.  Is there a way in
Openwrt to allow only a certain ip address on to the Internet without
actually letting all the other systems hang out on the Net.  I forget the
actual term it is something like Nat forwarding or redirection.

Scott

Stephen,

I would recommend the wrt54gl, the reason being that you can reflash it with
openwrt (http://www.openwrt.org) and get ssh access/iptables firewall
access. I've got two of these with OpenWrt and a decent firewall
configuration, and have had no problems.
