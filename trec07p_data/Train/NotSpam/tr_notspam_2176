Well, there's a slight omission on my part, but it's not really
misinformation.  I don't expect cairo to support all the bit depths and
image formats that exist.  But the problem is that Cairo just doesn't
have very good support for 16bpp right now _with_alpha_.

For starters, from cairo-deprecated.h:


So you can certainly get 16bpp 565 surfaces manually as a _side_ effect
of create_similar on a 16bpp Xlib window if X is running in 16bpp
mode.  

But here's where the problems start...  Given a 16bpp 565 xlib surface:

    source = cairo_surface_create_similar (target,
			CAIRO_CONTENT_COLOR,
			width, height);

gives you a 565 surface.

    source = cairo_surface_create_similar (target,
			CAIRO_CONTENT_COLOR_ALPHA,
			width, height);

gives you a 32-bit ARGB surface.

I can understand why; but in our case it's undesirable.  We'd rather
have 16bpp, but _some_ kind of alpha.  Like fontconfig property binding
with strong and weak.  The current code ensures that all the colors
possible in the target are possible in 'source', but we'd rather keep
the bit depth at 16bpp and get 1 or 4 bits of alpha rather than step up
to 32bpp.

There are a few issues here.

1) Since we're running in 565 in X, obviously pixel smashing has to
happen if there's any alpha in the pixmaps we're sending to X.  And
that's what's killing us right now.

2) Even if cairo did hand back a 1555 or 4444 surface, we'd still have
to composite it and smash it down to 565.  And pixman doesn't have
MMX-accelerated code for that anyway.

3) Maybe we should be running in 1555 or 4444 mode instead of 565, so
that we could get some native alpha without having to smash pixels.  But
of course we don't have MMX acceleration in pixman for these formats
either.

Ideally we could ask Cairo to create a surface of _any_ type we want,
either 1555, 4444, 0565, 8888, 0888, 0444, etc.  But cairo can't do that
AFAIK.  That's why I said "grudgingly supports 565" and "it's native
format is really 32bpp".  When I say "manually create" a surface, I mean
telling cairo _exactly_ what format of surface you want.
