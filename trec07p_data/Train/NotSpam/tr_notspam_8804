SatCon Receives $750,000 Contract to Develop Advanced ''Predictive''
Controller




BOSTON, May 09, 2007 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- SatCon Technology Corporation(R)
(Nasdaq CM: SATC), a developer and supplier of power management and
system architecture solutions for the alternative energy and distributed
power markets, today announced that it has been awarded a Phase II
contract from the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) to develop a
"Predictive Controller for Power Supply Prognostication." The total
value of the contract is $750,000 with the work being accomplished over
the next 18 months. The development and incorporation of this technology
into SatCon's successful line of commercial grade inverters, used for
fuel cell and photovoltaic applications, could provide an additional
competitive advantage for the company. 

"With the ever-increasing expansion of electrical solutions, there has
been increased interest in being able to predict failure of electrical
components and systems," said Dr. Leo Casey, SatCon's Chief Technology
Officer. "Performing prognostics within the system as it operates will
help to predict the remaining useful life of its components and thus
avoid system failures. This improves the safety of the system, but also
reduces operational costs by eliminating what may be unnecessary
scheduled maintenance and downtime. It can also be used to turn on
redundant components to prevent catastrophic failure in live critical
systems. Prognostics ability has significant benefits for such systems
in aerospace applications prompting AFRL's decision to fund this work.
It is also important for environments such as electric and
hybrid-electric automobiles and large power generation plants such as
solar and wind power farms where down time can have significant
implications to the grid or the end users of the generated power."
