There should be an 'or' between the two parts of 1 - see
http://www.debian.org/vote/1999/vote_0002
It seems Darren Benham (gecko) didn't copy the 'or' as I can't see any
other reason that it is missing.  Should I correct that?

Does the use of the logo satisfy 'the product it is used for is made
using a documented procedure as published on www.debian.org (for example
official CD-creation)'?  It looks like hinner.de is selling official CDs.

Thanks,
