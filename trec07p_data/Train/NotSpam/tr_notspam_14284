I've done it. Not with  grml but with the modified knoppix CD on the speakup 
web site. That was probably a year and a half ago. I can't tell you exactly 
what to do because I took so many false turns that I couldn't reproduce my 
own steps.  It took me probably 4 or 5 hours but I got it to work 
eventually. If you know what you're doing you could probably do it in 
considerably less time.

I don't think it matters which live CD you use. I found the instructions I 
used by googling for 'knoppix debootstrap'. I'm sure if you google for 'grml 
debootstrap' you'll find lots of instructions.
