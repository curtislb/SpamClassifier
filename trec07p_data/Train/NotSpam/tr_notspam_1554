Hi Kirk,

Was the express driver broken prior to today in CVS?  My
checkout for the Debian iso was two days ago for
integration into a fairly heavily patched 2.6.18 and
everything did compile after a bit of coercing.  I don't
have an express to test though so just wondering if I
should remaster with the new CVS.
