Of course.  Yet some dozen years later, the argument for keeping interfaces 
such as File::Find (because sysadmins should learn all about closures and 
callbacks but can only understand global variables) and code such as CGI.pm 
(it was SelfLoader before SelfLoader was cool and *that* was a while ago) in 
the Perl 5 core has absolutely nothing to do with quality, ease of use, or 
suitability for the problem domain and everything to do with incidentally 
having been first and, thus, immediate evolutionary dead ends.
