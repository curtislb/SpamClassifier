It seems to make sense.

And indeed, I would be satisfied with the MIDI file as source for the
song, as long as the MIDI file corresponds to the complete song (and not
to one instrument only, for instance...).
I do not happen to know if this is the case here, and that's why I said
"I'm not sure".  A clarification should be sought, IMHO.

I'm not really convinced: we must ask the person(s) who made the
recording.
If there are non-lossy-compressed recordings of the separate tracks,
they could be preferred for making modifications.

Your parenthetical sentence just expresses the concerns that I had in
mind when I said "I'm not sure".  A clarification is needed.

Really important, IMO.

I don't know, but I'm afraid we need one, as long as the soundfonts are
copyrightable works by themselves...
