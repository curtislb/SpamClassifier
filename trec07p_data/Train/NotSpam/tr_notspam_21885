Why did you change the subject to "nevermind"? The subject didn't change.

You used the /x modifier which allows for comments within regular 
expressions. Remove /x, and the old regex will work as expected.

Read "perldoc perlre" too.

You also could have written it this way:

open AUTHFILE, "</home/customercare/authorized_users.txt"
   or die "Can't open file: $!";
@email_list = grep !/^#/, <AUTHFILE>;
close AUTHFILE;
