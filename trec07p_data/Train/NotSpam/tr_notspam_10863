Well, now, let's get this discussion rolling along.

What are your 4 great tracks? Your 4 reasonable tracks? Your 4 bland 
tracks?

I can't agree about KOTM. I find it to be one of the more redeemable 
songs on the set. If it were given a SIYL treatment, it would have been 
that much better.

And, looking back, TSW might just be my favorite KB album, taken as a 
whole. HOL is half-great, but, oh, what a half. I also love TD and NFE. 
So those are the big 4 long-players for me.

TKI is something special, but not overwhelmingly strong from start to 
finish. Lionheart and Ae are flawed. TRS suffers from contributions by 
awful mainstream artists who are clearly not worth of Kate Bush.
