Subject: Trouble installing Tree-Suffix-0.14

Hi I am trying to install Tree-Suffix-0.14. And when I
run Makefile.PL, I get following messages
-----------------------------------------
Unrecognized argument in LIBS ignored: 'mypath
/libstree-0.4.2/lib'
Unrecognized argument in LIBS ignored: 'mypath….
/lib:.'
Note (probably harmless): No library found for -lstree
Writing Makefile for Tree::Suffix    
 --------------------------
 
And make command failed with bunch of errors. README
file doesn’t talk about any specific requirements.
However, I installed libstree, as I thought it could
be the prerequisite, and I set environment variable
CFLAGS= mypath../libstree-0.4.2/include and
LDFLAGS= mypath../libstree-0.4.2/lib . I tried
different ways, but I couldn’t install it. Can anyone
help on this one please? As I am not sure, what I am
doing wrong or what is the right way to install it. I
am trying to install it in both Linux and SunOS with
with c complier installed. Thank you very much.
