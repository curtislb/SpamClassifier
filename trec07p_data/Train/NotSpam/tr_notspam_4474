The future of the medical bill
(The Times of India Via Thomson Dialog NewsEdge)

Laxman Bhaskar's face looks pale, as though an inner glow has been
turned off. He is a grim man in his thirties who is right now in the
almost silent workshop of the Cancer Patients Aid Association (CPAA). He
is printing a design on a cloth bag, a small favour to an organisation
that is keeping him alive.

Bhaskar has a rare cancer - chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). About
30,000 Indians are diagnosed with the disease every year. The drugs that
CPAA gives him cost Rs 10,000 a month. And that's cheap. He takes the
generic versions, the copies, made by Indian companies. The original,
usually called Glivec, owned by Swiss pharma giant, Novartis, would have
cost him over Rs 1,20,000 a month.

Novartis is at the moment in a battle with the CPAA and, in a way, the
Indian government, to win the exclusive marketing rights for Glivec
which will result in local companies being ordered to stop making
cheaper copies of the drug.

Novartis says that it invented the base compound (imatinib) and deserves
the exclusive rights to market it. The appeal of Novartis, till recently
heard by the Madras High Court, has now been transferred to the newly
created Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) which is expected
to pass a verdict soon.

At stake is a very complex issue, almost philosophical. That the poor
have a right to live is a truth that has no meaning if there are no
life-saving drugs in the first place. And it is not the goodness of
activists that cures diseases, but the commercial motives of big pharma
companies like Novartis which spawn multi-million dollar research.

If Novartis wins the battle for Glivec, Indian generics, whom the Swiss
company's CEO Daniel Vasella had once described as "thieves", will be
wiped out and not only a cancer cure but also HIV, TB and other
treatments will become many times more expensive. The ramifications of
the Glivec battle is so important to the commerce of cure and the very
meaning of a poor person's life in a capitalistic world, that
journalists from the first world, especially Europe, have been landing
in the country in the last few weeks.

At the heart of the battle, as always, is a technicality. It is called,
without affection by Novartis, 3d. It is a section in the Indian Patents
Act. The base compound of Glivec was invented in 1993. It was only two
years later that India joined the World Trade Organisation.

India said that over the next 10 years, as it moved towards a patents
regime, it would consider fresh patent applications of inventions that
did not exist before 1995. So the original base compound of Glivec did
not qualify, but Novartis filed for patent for a slight variation, a
beta crystal form.

In 2003, Novartis was granted the exclusive marketing rights for that.
But when the Indian Patent Law came into effect in 2005, there was a
clause in section 3d that implied that cosmetic variations, like the
beta crystal form of imatinib, cannot be considered. So, in 2006,
Novartis lost its exclusive rights and the Indian generics who were
debarred from making copies rose again.

Novartis claims that it is only fighting for its rights and not for
money. A spokesperson of the company says that its Glivec International
Patient Assistance program (GIPAP) has given the drug free to 8,000
patients in India. "Ninety-nine percent of the Indians who have been
taking Glivec, have been getting it free."

It is a claim that makes Y K Sapru, the gritty chief of CPAA, a former
pharma executive himself, laugh. "What they don't tell you is that they
give the drug to patients free for one or two months, that's all.
Novartis is not here for social service. It is here to make money. Last
year, Glivec made $2.6 billion worldwide. They want to make more money.
And this argument that they deserve to earn because they invested in the
research of the drug is not very good. Fifty percent of the funding came
from the US government, 30% from a US NGO and 10% from the Oregon Health
and Science Institute. Only 10% came from Novartis."(Novartis did not
respond when asked for a confirmation.)

A few months ago, Novartis CEO Daniel Vasella is reported to have said
that Sapru was being financed by Indian pharma companies. Sapru filed a
defamation suit for half a million dollars. Vasella eventually claimed
that he never made the statements. It is also said that Sapru is angry
because Novartis did not choose CPAA to run its free treatment programme
but instead chose an international cancer charity organisation called
Max Foundation.

"It's true that we were in talks with Novartis and things didn't work
out between us, but that's all there is to it,"Sapru says. He accuses
Novartis of using Max Foundation, "to promote both Glivec and to collect
clinical trial data. This has been confirmed by the founder of Max
Foundation, Pedro Rivarola."Rivarola's son, Max had died of cancer and
so he was emotionally involved in the charity.

A letter written by Rivarola to Sapru is part of the legal documents in
the Glivec case. Rivarola says in the letter, "I believed (being truly
na?ve) in the good will of Novartis The relationship changed into a
daily struggle to keep my beloved foundation independent from Novartis'
insatiable pawsThe last drop in the goblet made me leave. It was the
situation in Thailand where Novartis demanded that patients had to buy
three months of supply before qualifying for the program; It's time to
stop this as the name of my son is being trashed and abused just for
marketing reasons."

The battle beween CPAA and Novartis also has racial overtones. It is
being unofficially viewed as MNC vs India. Anand Grover, a lawyer
representing CPAA against Novartis says, "It's time the whites know that
they cannot walk into this country and expect us to be intimidated as
before. We know how to fight."He is optimistic that the future of Indian
generics is not in jeopardy. "But don't forget, they too are in it for
the money."

Sapru says that the production cost of a Glivec generic is about Rs
1,000. "Indian companies are selling it at 10 times the price. So, they
are making huge profits. But, at least, they are cheaper than Glivec."DG
Shah, secretary general of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, says
matter-of-factly, "It's true, we are not here for charity."Indian pharma
is valued at over $ 5 billion, 65% of this coming from the export of
generic drugs to developing.

"These revenues will help us invest in research,"DG Shah says, "and in
the coming years, India will be known as not just the maker of cheap
copies but as a research hub which makes its own blockbuster drugs."But
the future of generics and how the poor will buy their right to stay
alive is still not clear.
