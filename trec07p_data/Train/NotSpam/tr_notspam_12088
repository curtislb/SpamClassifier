The WHO drafting group on Brazilian resolution meets at 6 PM today in
Room 7.  The African Region (47 Member States), Viet Nam and Iran
public expressed support for the resolution as well as Argentina,
Bolivia and Chile.

Germany (on behalf of the EU) and Switzerland were of the view that any
further resolutions on IGWG should be process-based in order to further
guide the work of the WHO IGWG rather than being predicated upon
technical or political content.

The US noted that the IGWG process be tightened up.
