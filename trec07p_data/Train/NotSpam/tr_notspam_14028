There is a hook into init_library_paths in library.c on a C level. You
have to provide C code to append to the array.

On a PIR level I am not sure.

See [RFC] extension guessing on the ML. I am working on the design
for this right now.

If a path is relative in the path-list it will be prefixed with one of=20
two possible values. The first is "prefix" which is set in config.pasm.
The environment variable PARROT_RUNTIME can override the iglobals[prefix].

I am re-factoring this. I want to get rid of it entirely and generate
this robotic C code from a configuration file of some sort.

there was a extension guessing part that was reverted while a more thorough
design is hashed out. In the extension guessing proposal there was a featur=
e to
traverse the array in reverse order. That is why the array traversals are
[end] instead of [end + 1] as usual. The revert probably ripped out the com=
ments that=20
documented why this was.

If you are really interested in this area please look at what I have been d=
oing
so we do not collide. There are two patches in RT currently: one that hoist=
s all of the
generic path handling routines into path.c/path.h , and one that cleans up =
Parrot_get_runtime_prefix.

Beyond that I have the RFC where a new design is hashed out and a prototype=
 implementation.
