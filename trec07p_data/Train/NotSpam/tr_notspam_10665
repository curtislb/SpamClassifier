Your simplified code makes testing much easier -- thank you.

I used "#" to increase the number of
characters that qx() feeds into the Unix shell
(my actual 1300 line SAS program program constructed by Perl 
and fed into Unix with qx() does not enhance the underlying
large-number-of-characters problem).
With just blank lines (no "#"),  I suspect either Perl or the Unix shell drops those lines,
so there is no large-number-of-characters problem.

Let me drop each line's "#", but instead begin each line with ":" 
(Unix ignores such lines) followed by 99 more characters of "A",

$ perl -e'
my @manylines = ( ( ": " . "A" x 99 . "\n" ) x 1257, q[echo "Last
Line of large program!"] );
print qx[@manylines];
'  |wc
      0       0       0

yet using 1256 or fewer such lines,

$ perl -e'
my @manylines = ( ( ": " . "A" x 99 . "\n" ) x 1256, q[echo "Last
Line of large program!"] );
print qx[@manylines];
'  |wc
      2       5      28

So, after a certain number of characters (101*1257 = 126957 here),
qx() executions give no response.

Letting my imagination loose,
I ponder that  qx()  could have a fixed buffer size, which cannot be exceeded;
or Unix takes in a block of size 2^16 but not of size 2^17.
But I am probably only cluttering my mind with possibilities,
when the problem is a simple looking  large-number-of-characters problem.
Any ideas?
