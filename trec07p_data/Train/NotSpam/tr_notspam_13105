Tom, thank you for the detailed answer and sorry for the long delay,
i'm at a conference right now. This sadly means that i have no access to
the papers, it will take more time. 

But in the meanwhile, here's a little program which might be useful,

structural.balance <- function(g) {

  triples <- combn(1:vcount(g)-1, 3)
  good <- bad <- 0
  for (t in 1:ncol(triples)) {
    
    tri <- triples[,t]
    edges <- E(g) [ tri %--% tri ]
    if (length(unique(get.edges(g, edges))) < 3) { next }
    if (prod(E(g)[edges]$sign) > 0) {
      good <- good +1
    } else {
      bad <- bad +1
    }
  }
  c(good, bad)
}

It uses the igraph package, version 0.4 or higher. Basically it
extracts all possible triples from the network and first checks
whether it is connected or not. If it is a connected triple then 
it simply multiples the values of the edges to see whether it is
positive or negative.

Here is a little test with a directed random graph with random
edge values:

g <- erdos.renyi.game(20, p=5/20, directed=TRUE)
E(g)$sign <- sample( c(-1,1), ecount(g), repl=TRUE, prob=c(0.5,0.5))

structural.balance(g)

The code is of course suboptimal, it is brute-force, but if your
networks are small it might be good enough.

Best Regards,
Gabor
