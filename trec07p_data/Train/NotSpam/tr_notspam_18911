Dear Cabot Wealth Advisory Reader,

The market has given us a great bull run this year and I hope you're
enjoying your profits.  The stocks of young, fast-growing companies like
Crocs, First Solar, MasterCard, Novatel Wireless, Baidu and Chipotle have
been on fire, bringing early investors big gains.

But how long can this bull market last?  The truth is that no one knows;
the future is not yet written and anything can happen.

As the weeks go by, the course of interest rates will certainly be
important.  Investor sentiment, as always, will matter.  And corporate
earnings, both real and projected, will have a big effect.

But how do you deal with all this information?  More specifically, how
long -- and in what stocks --do you stay aggressively invested, knowing
that the risk of a market top grows greater with each passing day?

Fortunately, over the decades we've amassed an arsenal of tools that help
us see the potentialities, and subscribers to the Cabot Market Letter
receive regular updates on these indicators and all our recommended stocks
in every issue.

Today, I'm offering a special deal to new subscribers who've never tried
the Cabot Market Letter before.  It's very affordable, and if it can save
your profits in just one stock, you know it's worth it.
