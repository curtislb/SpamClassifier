Actually, with a hack or two and some (rather specific) hardware, you  
can already run mac osx on a pc.
The reason it takes particular hardware is because of the drivers  
included with the os.
No need to make drivers for other hardware when you generally roll  
your own.
However, folks are already running osx on pc machines.
It can be done.
The hacks are mostly for  removing the checks performed to ensure  
apple software, and the reliance on apple particular firmware.
