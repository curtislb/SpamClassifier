What C says about piracy is exactly what I am talking
about.  Payment should be made for creation and no charge
should be taken for distribution since it can be
accomplished costlessly.  

As for the CD as art and cultural memorabilia, I find the
cd as a storage and distribution device is unecassary and
outdated.  Strayform allows for the commissioning and
production of any digital media.  So for those artist and
fans who find that important artwork and other
supplementaries can be included in Proposals.  Our
upcomming merchandising system will also allow for artists
to sell physical items such as t-shirts, cds, autographed
instruments etc...

www.strayform.com
where artists and fans connect to fund and distribute new
creative works.
