See #34994:
http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=34994

(I tried to reply earlier to #34994 on RT but I guess that wasn't the right
way to do it.)

Anyway, there seems to be a long discussion about this at #34994.

I've now tried running make reallyinstall . The runtime prefix returned is
/usr/local, while the runtime/parrot directory gets installed to
/usr/local/lib/parrot, and config.fpmc is in /usr/local/lib/parrot/include.
That means config.pir is looking for config.fpmc in
/usr/local/runtime/parrot/include, which is wrong.

I don't know what the runtime prefix is good for right now. grepping in my
parrot directory returned just the parts in imcc that handle the
command-line, running.pod explaining about it, library.c that provides
Parrot_get_runtime_prefix, and inter_misc.c that gives the interpinfo
option.

IMHO, the runtime prefix should probably be parrot/runtime rather than just
the parrot dir, and /usr/local/lib (in my case) when installed rather than
just /usr/local. I don't know how this relates to what they were doing
regarding #34994.

In any case, even if the interpinfo part of my patch will be useful someday,
the part in config.pir is probably wrong, and it definitely won't work right
now when Parrot's installed.
