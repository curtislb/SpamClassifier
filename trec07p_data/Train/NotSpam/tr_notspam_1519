Hmmm, that's a good little bit of code, as was Damian's use of the
hyper-operator. The trick is to figure how how much I can use in Llama
6 without scaring off the reader. :)

I'm actually starting at the back of the book so I know what I have to
put in the front of the book to get that far. In previous Llamas the
file tests operators came before stat, but maybe this answer is a good
end-of-chapter sorta thing.

I'll also have to think about using given {} merely as a topicalizer
too, I guess, although showing it next to an explicit assignment to $_.

:)
