HEADLINES:

DEFIANCE: SENATE SENDS IRAQ SPENDING BILL TO WHITE HOUSE
Today, the Senate approved a $124 billion war spending bill that calls for U.S. combat troops to leave Iraq in 2008, sending the measure to the White House for a threatened veto by President Bush.  The bill's 51-46 margin is far short of the two-thirds vote needed to override a presidential veto, which President Bush says he will deliver swiftly. The House passed the same measure on a 218-208 vote last night.  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said the measure funds U.S. troops in the field while acknowledging that the 4-year-old war needs a political, not military, solution. He cited recent statements by General David Petraeus, the U.S. commander in Iraq, who told reporters today that, "Success, in the end, will depend on Iraqi actions."  "No one wants this nation to succeed in the Middle East more than I do," Reid said. "But I know that after four years of mismanagement and incompetence by this administration in the war in Iraq, there is no magic formula, no silver bullet !
 that will lead us to the victory we all desire."  But Republicans said the bill amounted to an admission of defeat. Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said demanding a withdrawal while U.S. commanders are claiming progress in pacifying the Iraqi capital would hand a victory to the al Qaeda terrorist network, which has taken root in Iraq since the 2003 invasion that toppled former dictator Saddam Hussein.  "We must give the plan for winning the military component of the war in Iraq a real chance to succeed," said McConnell, Republican of Kentucky.  “Without it, there is no political solution."  President Bush has said he will veto any bill that sets an "artificial timetable" for withdrawing troops from the war. White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said it is unclear when the bill will make it to the president's desk, but said the president would kill the bill swiftly -- "then get to work with congressional members on the next step."

APARTMENT BUILDING COLLAPSES IN TURKEY; 2 PEOPLE FREED FROM RUBBLE
Today rescuers freed a young girl and a man who were trapped beneath a multi-story apartment building that collapsed in Istanbul, apparently as construction workers tried to tear down a building next door.  It's not believed that anyone else is in the debris, journalist Andrew Finkel tells CNN.  Construction workers were trying to tear down a building next door and authorities believe that is what caused the apartment complex to collapse, Istanbul's mayor Kadir Topbas said.  Crowds of people immediately descended upon the pile of debris, frantically searching for anyone who might be trapped below.  The apartment building is located in the Sirinevler neighborhood of Istanbul, near the airport.  Residents said they evacuated the building after hearing a crack in the roof, but some went back inside before the building collapsed, Istanbul Governor Muammer Guler told CNN Turk.  The building was at least six stories high, and each level pancaked on top of each other.

BODY FOUND IN BURNT FARMHOUSE IS ALLEGED STATE TROOPER KILLER, OFFICIALS SAY
Authorities have confirmed that the charred body discovered, yesterday, in the rubble of a New York farmhouse destroyed by fire belongs to the suspect who killed a state trooper and wounded another.  The body was identified as Travis Trim's through fingerprint matching.  Police say the body was found in a doorway holding a rifle.  Trim is believed to have killed one state trooper and wounded another during a manhunt that began Tuesday after he allegedly shot and wounded another state trooper during a traffic stop.  While the cause of the blaze remained unknown, Felton said authorities fired several canisters of tear gas into the building shortly before the fire broke out at 6 p.m. "We're not saying it can absolutely not cause a fire, but it's not constructed to cause a fire," he said.

NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR TAKES FIRST STEPS
New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine has taken his first steps since he was badly injured two weeks ago in a car wreck.  Using a walker, Corzine took his first few steps Tuesday, his office said today.  A drainage tube remains in the area surrounding his lung, but doctors are pleased with his progress, a news release said. It added that President Bush called the Democrat yesterday to wish him well.  Corzine, 60, was removed last week from a respirator and is talking with his family and doctors.  Corzine has been moved from the intensive care unit at Cooper University Hospital in Camden, New Jersey. He appears to have recovered from a bout of tracheo-bronchitis and was taking antibiotics, according to a statement issued yesterday.

RICHARD GERE SUBJECT OF ARREST WARRANT, LAWYER SAYS
An Indian court issued an arrest warrant for American actor Richard Gere today.  It accuses him of violating the country's obscenity laws earlier this month when he kissed Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty, an attorney who filed the case tells CNN.  According to Poonam Bhandari, the warrant was issued by a lower court in
Jaipur, a tourist city about 185 miles west of New Delhi.  Under the warrant, Shetty has been requested to appear in court on May 5.  Court records were not immediate available.  "I was annoyed that Indian traditions had been violated," Bhandari said. "I'm a vigilant citizen.  I've done my duty."  The case stems from an April 15 AIDS awareness event in the Indian capital in which Gere wrapped his arms around Shetty and kissed her several times on her cheeks.  The encounter was played repeatedly on Indian TV and around the globe, prompting angry crowds in several Indian cities to burn effigies of Gere.  Such cases are often filed against celebrities in India and clog the country's the judicial system.
