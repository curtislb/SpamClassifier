Something as crude as 

use Data::Dumper;
open( FILE, '< file' )
  || die $!;
  my ( $line, $ela, $elb, $pre, %count, $i, $tot); $tot = 0; 
  while ( $line = <FILE> ) {
	$i++;
	( $ela, $elb ) = split ( '\|', $line );

	#
	# remove any white space
	#

	$elb=~s/\s+$//g;
	$elb=~s/^\s+//g;

	#
	# dont do the first element as will always
	# be different
	#

	if ( ( $ela ne $pre ) && $i != 1 ) {
		$count{$pre} = $tot;
		$tot = 0;
		$tot += $elb;
	}
	else {
		$tot += $elb;
	}
		$pre=$ela;
}

#
# get the final row total
#
$count{$pre} = $tot;
print Dumper(\%count);

Will probably do the job

Subject: How to sum up values

Dear all,

Question about the sum function; the file structure is as follows:

A|100
A|200
A|150
B|20
B|90
C|10
C|30
C|300

The result I want to obtain is to sum values in the second column
(columnB) for each particular letter in the first column (ColumnA); e.g.:

A|450
B|100
C|330

I don't want to use hash structure because the input file is very large. 
Is there any simple way to do that step-by-step: to sum up values in columnB
until the letter in columnA changes and print the result...

Thanks in advance for any suggestion, Andrej


#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;
 
open FH1, "< test.txt" or die "Can't open file : $!"; while (<FH1>) {
    chomp;
    ($columnA,$columnB)=split /\|/;
    ... ???
}
