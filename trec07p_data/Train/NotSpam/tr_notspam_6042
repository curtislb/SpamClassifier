Okay. I found the configuration file for speechd-up in Gentoo:
/etc/conf.d/speechd-up
Now: Here is what the file looks like:
# /etc/conf.d/speechd-up: config file for /etc/init.d/speechd-up

# Niceness level at which to run speechd-up

NICELEVEL=-5

DONTINITTABLES=1

I do not know if that will actually work. Could someone please look at my syntax and instruct me to weather I did that wrong?

The point is for the dontinittables 1 option to be activated on all system boot-ups.

Regards,

--Keith
