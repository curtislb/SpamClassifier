Hi,

Thank you for all the ideas.  No success so far, but I'll keep going 
through them.

In the meantime, I have what might be a better error for anyone who's good 
with these things, from alsaconf:

talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of
God. Your playing small doesn't serve the world.  (Marianne Williamson)
