Because, if I remember correctly, mod_perl will still be broken.
Unless he is willing to recompile it as well then he will have a
problem with it.  The docs seem to support my memory:

from the Apache docs*
    Should I Rebuild mod_perl if I have Upgraded Perl?
    Yes, you should. You have to rebuild the mod_perl enabled server
since it has
    a hard-coded @INC variable. This points to the old Perl and it is
probably linked
    to an old libperl library. If for some reason you need to keep the
old Perl version
    around you can modify @INC in the startup script, but it is better
to build afresh
    to save you getting into a mess.

This is not normally a problem on modern Linux boxes because upgrades
occur through a package management system that upgrades mod_perl at
the same time.
