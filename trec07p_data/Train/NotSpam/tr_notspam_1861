Wait, the "Mark Holder" would be [Y], I think.
At least, in the examples sent by Nathanael in his original message[1]
(the one that started this thread), SPI and Mozilla Foundation were
substituted for [Y].
Hence I would say:

I don't fully understand the "if applicable" part: could you elaborate,
please?

You're right, let's switch to the term "sign" as long as the trademark
license is concerned.

Mmmh, I'm afraid I lost you here.
How would the intended rewording look like?
Something like the following?

| If the Mark qualifies as an original work of authorship under
| copyright law, then the Mark Holder hereby also grants you a copyright
| license, but that is not a trademark license and should not be
| construed as one.

Not *in* this license, but *after* this license.
I would like to keep the two licenses visibly separate.

I think a textual delimiter should be enough to distinguish the two
licenses...


OK, let's try and recap (again):


| The sign [X] (hereafter "the Mark") is a trademark, rights to which
| are held by [Y] (hereafter "the Mark Holder"), representing [Z] if
| applicable.
|
| The Mark Holder hereby licenses you to use the Mark, or a modified
| version thereof, in any way and for any purpose, with the exception of
| the following:
|
| You are not authorized to use the Mark, or a modified version thereof,
| in commerce in any way that is likely to cause confusion, or to cause
| mistake, or to deceive
|
| (1) as to the affiliation, connection, or association of you or your
| product, service or other commercial activity with the Mark Holder, or
|
| (2) as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of your product,
| service or other commercial activity by the Mark Holder
|
| If the Mark qualifies as an original work of authorship under
| copyright law, then the Mark Holder hereby also grants you a copyright
| license, but that is not a trademark license and should not be
| construed as one.
