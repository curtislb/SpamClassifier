Sorry, but I don't think linux "molds" the kernel to the computer, unless 
your talking about grub.
I've done an install, and moved the harddrive around.
Also, this would kill the purpose of a USB key.
Anyway, the issue is on the comp I installed it on. (Not being able to add a 
second drive).
Thanks,
