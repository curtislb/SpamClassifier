Hi, well when speakup starts it changes my rate from zero to nine upon
speakup load.  Could all of these settings be changed or set threw
command line options rather then being hard coded into the dectalk
express or what ever synthisizer driver the user was using at the time?
It even would be better if they could be set upon compilation and
command line option so you would have the best of both worlds.  Looking
on the speakup site I see no information on how to check in sources or
changes, am I missing something?On Sat, 21 Apr 2007, Gregory Nowak wrote:
