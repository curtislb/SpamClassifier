I don't require actual character comparison, comparison of \{263a} is  
sufficient.
And it's rather difficult to determine in raw email what the correct  
charset is to use for each string.  I find that email sometimes  
passes multiple encodings in one message making it more difficult to  
pick apart.

The point that I'm coming from is post MIME::Parse which does a good  
job of parsing out messages but I'm not sure how to manage the  
decoding in every case.  It's hard to find good examples sometimes.

As for SpamAssassin.  I'm trying to stay away from that because it's  
very large and from a development perspective -- badly documented in  
the code.  Basically, SpamAssassin is capable for what it does, but I  
don't exactly want to do that.  Similar, yet, but not exactly.
