This is from compromise language for a bill to permit the approval of
generic biologics, or biosimilars.  The bill includes 12 years of data
exclusivity.  Some clinical trials would be required for generic
approval, though the FDA could waive the requirement on a case-by-case
basis.

Full text of the legislation, which would give biologics 12 years of
data exclusivity:
