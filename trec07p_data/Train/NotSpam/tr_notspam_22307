  I've used mercurial on a number of projects.  It's changed a lot since
you tried it.  It's fast, simple, and has smaller repositories than git. :)

  I'm not sure about git, but mercurial doesn't work that way.
Individuals can sync trees with each other, and push/pull to a central
repository.

  What has worked for me for collaboration is the following work flow,
for N people working on a sub-project is to have multiple repositories
and branches.  Each developer has their own repository that they commit
to locally.  Plus, there's a central repository where they coordinate
their changes.  The central repository also has a mirror of the main
public repository.

  The idea is that everyone works in their own private repo.  The group
of people have their own branch.  Plus, there's one central place for
merging updates from the main trunk into the branch, so individual
developers don't have to do this.

  When the feature is done, the merge / push to the main branch is easy,
because the subgroup has maintained sync with the trunk.
