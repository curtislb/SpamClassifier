Nothing concerning the decpc shows up in /var/log/syslog.

/var/log/messages gets the following two lines:
Jun  4 14:37:09 taz kernel: Probing for Dectalk PC.
Jun  4 14:37:09 taz kernel: Dectalk PC: 250-257, Driver Version 1.1,

Echoing and catting text to /dev/synth and /proc/speakup/synth_direct
produce neither audio nor screen output of any kind.

The output from `dtload -v` is as follows:

I can hear a 'thump' in my headphones when I cold boot the machine, so
I believe I have a good connection for audio output.  I have been
doing everything as root, logged in via ssh, so I do not expect that
any file permissions should be a problem.  I am not sure how to test
the hardware further at this point, but I will keep trying anything
that comes to mind.  By the way, there are two jacks on the card--I
have tried them both with my headphones.  Any suggestions of other
things to try would be appreciated.

Thanks, and have a great day.
