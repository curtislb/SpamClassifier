Is this a joke?

Have people forgotten Wikipedia unilaterally relicensed without getting
consent from its copyright holders?  See near the end of
http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2003/05/msg00565.html
The linked emails now seem to be
http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikipedia-l/2001-October/000627.html
http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikipedia-l/2002-June/002251.html
but Wikipedia URIs are not Cool http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI

Perhaps some would call this academic, but then perhaps some call any
copyright infringment which is not prosecuted an academic worry.  Should
non-enforcement encourage us to ignore the expressed wishes?

This is England calling.  I don't get what USians call Fair Use.  The FDL
is a practical problem in several ways, including reference cards,
poison pill invariant sections and inability to fix some sections.

Not even RMS or the FSF calls the FDL a Free Software licence.

This is wrong.  Debian delayed moving FDL'd stuff to non-free for over a
year after the problem was noticed, waiting on promised FSF cooperation.
I think a full release went out in the meantime.  As I understand it,
it was FSF asking us to wait because they were busy with things and then
the GPLv3.

I think the Debian project was more than willing to help resolve this
amicably, but FSF seemed determined to keep the non-free-software aspects
of FDL and was just yanking our chain.  Even then, some FDL'd
material got a special approval into main.
