Hi. I remember the last time I installed Slackware, I bypassed all the menus/etc entirely, and did most of it manually. I created all my partitions, formatted them, copied all the packages I 
wanted to the root partition, made sure the rest were mounted, then ran /sbin/installpkg *.tgz (of course copying installpkg from the CD to /sbin on the disk, and chrooting first). I believe I 
let the installer generate a lilo.conf, because I was too lazy at the time to write my own. Granted by itself, this method of installation is a bit convoluted; however, I think it could open 
the way to unattended installing, since it is easily scriptable. You could even extend the script to take some configuration options, and incorporate those into your install as needed.
