TONIGHT ON THE CBS  <http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/eveningnews/main3420.s=
html> EVENING NEWS

Here is an early preview of what we are planning for tonight's CBS EVENING =
NEWS...=20

Good afternoon,=20

Katie's on assignment today. This is Anthony Mason filling in.=20

CBS News reported today that the patient with extreme drug-resistant tuberc=
ulosis is 31-year-old Atlanta lawyer Andrew Haley Speaker. In a strange twi=
st, Speaker's new father-in-law is a government scientist who has studied t=
uberculosis - but he says there's no connection to his son-in-law's infecti=
on. Kelly Cobiella will have the very latest on this evolving story and wil=
l also tell us how the public is reacting. Also, the ease in which the pati=
ent crossed the country's border has exposed cracks in the national securit=
y system. Nancy Cordes will look at what this case can illustrate about our=
 country's preparedness.=20

In Iraq, the troop surge has reached full strength. But does it have a chan=
ce of succeeding by September? David Martin will talk with one Lieutenant G=
eneral who is not optimistic.=20

Meanwhile, President Bush prepared to clash with other world leaders at the=
 upcoming G-8 summit by announcing his own plan for battling climate change=
. Who's backing it and who's calling it just another smoke screen? Jim Axel=
rod will have the answers.=20

Hate e-mail Spam? You might be seeing a little bit less of it. Robert Alan =
Soloway, now known as one of the world's top spammers, was arrested today. =
Bill Whitaker will tell you how this could affect your in-box.=20

Also tonight, we'll take you inside the place a sophisticated form of drug =
dealing takes place - and it looks just like a doctor's office. They're cal=
led pill mills, and are the source of a CBS News investigation, which revea=
ls the ease with which prescription drugs can be purchased - without a pres=
cription. Chief Investigative Correspondent Armen Keteyian will report.=20

Finally, Byron Pitts will give you a look at the library dedicated today to=
 Rev. Billy Graham.=20

I hope you'll join us for this and more,=20

Anthony Mason=20
