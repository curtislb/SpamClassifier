Ae is not the hoped for "Big Comeback", rather it is "The Great
Disappointment" (Look up 'Millerites' if you don't know what I'm referring
to). It's merely another CD and a fairly bland one at that, albeit a bland
Kate CD. 

Kate's masterpieces, IMHO, are the breakthrough "TD" and the marvelous
"HoL". Having said that, I too, play "NFE" much more than all her other
albums. There's something special about that one I can't quite put my finger
on.

Of course your mileage may vary . . .
