Actually, you don't need to upgrade to 5.8.8 if you don't need the new 
feature which latest SpamAssassin introduced to  allow SA rules written in 
multi-bytes languages. Add "use bytes" back to Mail::SpamAssassin::Message 
will skip the broken SARE rules warnings. Too late you already decided to 
upgrade to 5.8.8 :)

Why don't you get rid of all current perl and perl libraries and build 
from tarball source, then run the new installed cpan command to install 
modules that SA depends on
