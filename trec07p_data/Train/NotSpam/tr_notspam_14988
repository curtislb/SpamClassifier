Yes I am reading the documentation now, which is well written but

Thank you for your suggestions on plotting, I will look into it. I  
was using histograms of mean proportions + SE until now because it  
was what seemed the most straightforward given my specific questions.  
If we come back to my original data (abandoning the statistical  
language for a while ;) ) I have proportions of fishes caught 1. near  
the surface, 2. a bit below, .... 5. near the bottom. The questions I  
want to ask are for example: does the vertical distribution of  
species A and species B differ? So I can plot the mean proportion at  
each depth for both species and obtain a visual representation of the  
vertical distribution of each.
At this stage differences between fishes that accumulate near the  
surface or near the bottom are quite obvious. If I add error bars I  
can get an idea of the variability of those distributions. The issue  
arise when I want to *test* for a difference between the  
distributions of species A and B. If I use a basic KS test I can only  
compare the mean proportions for species A (5 points) to the mean  
proportions of species B (5 points) and this has low power + does not  
take in account the variability around those means. In addition I may  
also want to know wether there is a difference within species A, B  
and C and pairwise KS tests would increase alpha error risk. Am I  
explaining things correctly? Does this seem logical to you too?
As for the PCA I must admit I don't really understand what you mean.

Thank you very much again.
