Looks like a termination clause for any version still called ion that kicks
in 28 days after a new version is released.  Requires a rename at least.

Is this what is going to happen to free software as it becomes
more popular?  Every author's ego projection will trump sharing and
redistribution?  Heck, if their ego is that demanding, why don't they call
the official version "Brian Clough's ion3" (or whatever the author's name
is)?
