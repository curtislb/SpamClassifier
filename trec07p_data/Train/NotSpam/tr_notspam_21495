Hi all,
My father is a person who expects Windows XP to be on my machine every day.
The deal is.
I bought a new gateway in April origenally intended to be the replacement Windows machine. But I have been considering running Linux natively entirely alone on it, and whiping Windows, and perhaps virtually running it instaead.
Problem is, My dad, who cannot understand much less begin to learn Linux, cannot stand anything then Windows.
I considered turning my pentium into a Windows box again, but relaly cannot aford to lose Linux on that box either.
A couple of months agoe, my dad logged in to my box, expecting a desktop, start menu, etc.
He saw a Linux log interminal, prompting for a password.
So he shut the system down improperly.
After that, I had to restore Windows from a clone.
I have done this too many times! And now I am being told by my dad who owns the electrical power (and who could kick my but and such) that I cannot, run Linux, whatsoever) and that he may unplug/ground me off the computer.
Any suggestions? This is really an act of unfairness!
But how can I explain to a sighted man who has a tempor and who cannot stand Linux or anything different? Thanks! Regards, --Keith
