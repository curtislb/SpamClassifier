You could do the obvious, and lump categories such as 1-6 or 1-7 
together to make a composite category.

You don't mention the size of your dataset. If there are 10,000 data, 
you might live with a 1% category. If you only have 100 data, you 
have too many categories.

Also, next time plan your study and training better so that next time 
your categories are fully utilized. And don't use so many categories. 
People have trouble even selecting responses on a 5-level scale.
