Hi, I was wondering if there will be a boot disc that can be used to
install redhat 7 over the internet as when getting the DVD of 6 after
installing there were so many upgraded packages it was just like
reinstalling an entire new system all over again after I had just
installed off the DVD.  I see the importants of also having the DVD for
those of us who might not upgrade the first thing after installation but
for those of us who want the most latest versions of the packages it might
e better to also have a net installation as is with debian.  Will this be
done as well as a DVD version?
