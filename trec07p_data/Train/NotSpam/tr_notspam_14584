Lieberman in Iraq on unannounced trip

BAGHDAD (CNN) -- U.S. Sen. Joseph Lieberman is in the Iraqi capital on an   unannounced trip, CNN's Paula Hancocks reported Wednesday.

He visited a joint security station where U.S. and Iraqi forces are based, as well as a forward operating base and a local Baghdad market.

Lieberman, the independent Democrat from Connecticut, has largely backed the Bush administration's policies in Iraq.

His trip comes a few weeks after Vice President Dick Cheney's unannounced visit to Iraq.

ZOELLICK CHOSEN FOR WORLD BANK POST: President Bush has chosen Robert B. Zoellick, a senior diplomat and trade envoy who became a top Goldman Sachs executive last year, to lead the World Bank and try to heal the bitter rifts left by the ouster of Paul D. Wolfowitz, the administration said Tuesday. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. said Mr. Zoellick had emerged as the first choice of economic ministers around the world, who have been calling for someone to overcome the bank's credibility problems among donor and recipient countries alike. "Bob has a very strong track record working with colleagues and leaders to get results," Mr. Paulson said in an interview after word of the appointment spread. "He's got great energy and enthusiasm and will be able to hit the ground running. I also think he’s got strong management capabilities."  Mr. Zoellick, 53, has served in high-ranking foreign policy and economic policy posts under three Republican presidents, beginning with Ronal!

BUSH LASHES OUT AT CRITICS OF IMMIGRATION BILL: President Bush lashed out at critics within his own party Tuesday, accusing Republican opponents of distorting the immigration deal he negotiated with leading congressional Democrats and playing on the politics of fear to undermine public support. In stern tones normally reserved for the liberal opposition, Bush said conservatives fighting the immigration proposal "haven't read the bill" and oppose it in some cases because "it might make somebody else look good." Their "empty political rhetoric," he said, threatens to thwart what he called the last, best chance to fix an immigration system that all sides agree is broken.

SPLIT COURT LIMITS BIAS SUITS: A Supreme Court once again split by the thinnest of margins ruled yesterday that workers may not sue their employers over unequal pay caused by discrimination alleged to have occurred years earlier. The court ruled 5 to 4 that Lilly Ledbetter, the lone female supervisor at a tire plant in Gadsden, Ala., did not file her lawsuit against Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. in the timely manner specified by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The decision moved Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to read a dissent from the bench, a usually rare practice that she has now employed twice in the past six weeks to criticize the majority for opinions that she said undermine women's rights.

BUSH SEEKS $30 BILLION TO FIGHT AIDS: President Bush will call on Congress today to provide $30 billion toward battling the global AIDS crisis over the first five years after he leaves office, according to senior administration officials, a doubling of the current U.S. commitment. The increase in the President's Emergency Program for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) would provide lifesaving treatment to 2.5 million people, administration officials said last night -- about 1.4 million more than the program now serves. The program's original five-year mandate, which provided for $15 billion in U.S. funding, will expire in September 2008. Bush's plan would extend that five more years.

EXPERTS: HARSH INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES OUTMODED: As the Bush administration completes secret new rules governing interrogations, a group of experts advising the intelligence agencies are arguing that the harsh techniques used since the 2001 terrorist attacks are outmoded, amateurish and unreliable. The psychologists and other specialists, commissioned by the Intelligence Science Board, make the case that more than five years after the Sept. 11 attacks, the Bush administration has yet to create an elite corps of interrogators trained to glean secrets from terrorism suspects. While billions are spent each year to upgrade satellites and other high-tech spy machinery, the experts say, interrogation methods — possibly the most important source of information on groups like Al Qaeda — are a hodgepodge that date from the 1950s, or are modeled on old Soviet practices.

BUSH ADMINISTRATION INCREASING IMMIGRATION APPLICATION FEES: The Bush administration will announce increases in immigration application fees Wednesday that will nearly double the cost of citizenship and almost triple the cost of becoming a legal permanent resident. The new fees, reflecting an average 66 percent increase from current costs, led immigrant advocates and some members of Congress to criticize them as a "wall" that could bar poorer immigrants from attaining citizenship. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services officials countered that the increases were essential to help the overloaded agency reduce its backlog and speed up service. "The reason we're raising the fees, short answer, is that we need the money," said Emilio Gonzales, director of Citizenship and Immigration Services. "A lot of people are going to be affected by this, there's no sugar-coating it." Los Angeles Times: U.S. to raise citizenship, green card fees

SOLID GOP VOTERS GETTING WEARY OVER IRAQ: Through four elections, Debbie Thompson has supported Representative Mark Steven Kirk, a Republican and staunch backer of the Bush administration’s policies in Iraq. But Ms. Thompson, a mother of two from this affluent suburb of Chicago, says her views on the war have evolved, and she now wants Mr. Kirk to change, too. Though voters here in the 10th Congressional District have elected a Republican to the House for as long as anyone can remember, there is a newfound hostility about the war that is being directed toward Mr. Kirk, who was narrowly re-elected to a fourth term last November. Nor is Mr. Kirk alone in his struggle to appease increasingly restless constituents. He and 10 other Republicans in Congress recently delivered a warning to President Bush that conditions in Iraq needed to improve soon because public support of the war was crumbling.

OBAMA LAYS OUT HEALTH PLAN: Sen. Barack Obama on Tuesday sought to address an issue that polls show greatly concerns voters, as he offered a health-care plan that pledged to insure all children and provide better access to health insurance for adults by lowering costs. The presidential candidate and Illinois Democrat placed himself in the center of his party's mainstream with a plan that relies heavily on the promise of cost savings through a big investment in technology but also would be funded in part by allowing President Bush's tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans to expire. The proposal is not quite as sweeping as that offered by former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards, experts said, while Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) has not yet offered a fully fleshed-out plan. Chicago Tribune: Obama offers health plan focused on cutting costs

SHEEHAN ENDS IRAQ PROTEST: Cindy Sheehan, the anti-war activist who spent the last two years trying to confront President Bush and traveling around the world in protest of the Iraq war, says she will now try a new tactic -- silence. Sheehan announced on a liberal Web site on Monday that she was ending her role as the face of the American peace movement, leaving Texas to return to California, her home state, to "be a mother to my surviving children and try to regain some of what I lost." In what she described as a "resignation letter," Sheehan wrote in her online diary on the Daily Kos blog: "Good-bye America ... you are not the country that I love and I finally realized no matter how much I sacrifice, I can't make you be that country unless you want it. It's up to you now." Chicago Tribune: Sheehan ends her protest

LOS ANGELES MAYOR TO ENDORSE CLINTON: Democratic presidential contender Hillary Rodham Clinton will announce the endorsement of Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa today, a development that could help the New York senator expand her reach among Latino and union voters in many parts of the country. The expected announcement follows months of political courtship on both coasts. Clinton has met with Villaraigosa several times in Los Angeles and Washington and has wooed him more aggressively than any other top Democratic candidate. Villaraigosa is California's most recognizable Latino political figure and a rising Democratic star.  Los Angeles Times: Clinton to get Villaraigosa's endorsement

GIULIANI RAISES $500K DURING NEW YORK BIRTHDAY BASH: Presidential hopeful Rudy Giuliani celebrated his 63rd birthday with fund-raising bashes across the city yesterday -- while defending his record on 9/11. "I love it. It reminds me of the old days of traveling around New York City doing five boroughs in one day," said Giuliani, before entering the second fund-raising event at Spielaston Manor in Queens. The four galas for Giuliani, whose actual birthday was Monday, also included events in City Island, Bronx; Bay Ridge, Brooklyn; and Staten Island. They generated $500,000, a campaign insider said. At two of the events, families of firefighters killed on 9/11 blasted Giuliani for inadequate planning for a terrorist attack. New York Post: Birthday Boy Rudy "Boroughs" for $$

THOMPSON TO OFFICIALLY 'TEST THE WATERS': Speculation over whether Fred Thompson is serious about running for president just went toes-up. Mr. Thompson's not-yet-a campaign has confirmed: He's dipping his toes in. Specifically, a Thompson adviser told The New York Sun yesterday, he will announce the formation of a presidential "testing-the-waters" committee early next week -- possibly as early as Sunday. A "testing the waters" committee is a step before the more familiar presidential exploratory committee. It allows the former Tennessee senator to raise money and hire staff. But it also prevents him from doing a number of other things: advertising his candidacy, referring to himself as a real candidate (presumably just in public, he can say whatever he likes in front of the bathroom mirror), raising money that could be transferred to another candidate, or raising money to get on the ballot. New York Sun: Thompson to dip his toes

CLINTON SAYS FAVORS FOR BIG BUSINESS MUST END: Criticizing tax breaks for the wealthy and subsidies for corporations that ship jobs overseas, Sen. Hillary Clinton said yesterday she would outlaw special favors to big business as part of her "new progressive vision for this new century." Clinton said she her nine-point program would restore the balance that has been lost during the Bush Administration, which has seen productivity rise and corporate profits rise while family incomes have fallen. "I think a lot of people would like to go back six years and push the restart button on the 21st Century, and do it all over again the right way," Clinton told a crowd of about 200 at the Manchester School of Technology. "The past six years it is as if we have gone back to the era of the robber barons." New Hampshire Union Leader: Clinton calls for an end to favors for big business

BIDEN: SENATE DEMOCRATIC RIVALS FLIP-FLOPPED ON IRAQ FUNDING: Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on Tuesday said his rivals for the 2008 nomination who are fellow U.S. senators voted against protecting U.S. troops in Iraq last week, and switched their positions in the process. "As long as there are troops who are in a position where, if we don’t fund them they are going to be hurt, I'm not going to cut off funding," Biden said during a meeting with Des Moines Register editors and reporters "That's what the other candidates said too, but they changed their mind." Biden was referring to last week's vote on a supplemental bill to finance the war in Iraq. The measure passed with bipartisan support after language calling for a timetable for troop withdrawal was removed. Des Moines Register: Biden says rivals who are senators switched positions

OBAMA MAKING HIS OWN CAMPAIGN RULES: Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) isn't playing it by the book. As other White House hopefuls for the Democratic nomination scramble to attend every major event in key primary states, Obama picks and chooses. And while Democratic candidates court their liberal base, Obama has not been afraid to offend influential constituents in the Democratic Party. Some have labeled Obama’s campaign as error-prone; others simply call it unconventional. Obama will be the only Democratic presidential candidate who doesn’t attend at least one of two major state Democratic functions in the early-voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire this Saturday.

ROMNEY WOULD DONATE PRESIDENTIAL SALARY TO CHARITY: Campaigning in New Hampshire yesterday, Mitt Romney said he would not take a salary if elected president and would instead donate the money to charity. "When I got started, I went to school and I never anticipated that I'd be as financially successful as I was, and then my business went far better than I expected it would," Romney said at a question-and-answer session at insurer Liberty Mutual in Dover, according to the Associated Press. Romney, who did not take a salary during his four years as Massachusetts governor, later told reporters he would probably accept the $400,000 presidential salary but give the money away. "I presume I would take the salary and then I would donate at least that amount -- or more -- to charity," Romney said, the AP reported. Boston Globe: Romney says he'd forgo president's salary

AFFLECK: 'KEN DOLL' ROMNEY WILL WIN GOP NOMINATION: "Gone, Baby, Gone" director Ben Affleck, who tried mightily -- but unsuccessfully -- to get Sen. John Kerry elected to the White House, said he expects ex-Gov. Mitt Romney to be the Republican nominee in 2008. Chatting about the upcoming presidential race on the season finale of "Real Time with Bill Maher," the Cambridge homey said he thinks the GOP will end up with Romney because the ex-gov looks good, has nice hair - and the Republicans really don't have anyone else. He says he doesn't like abortion and he's all clean-cut and he looks like a Ken doll," said Affleck who was doing a rather amusing imitation of our ex-gov during the Romney rant. "The Mormonism thing is really suspect," he added, "but they'll take it at this point. I mean, who else do they have? Crazy (Rudy) Giuliani and (John) McCain who's completely insane? They don't have any other options." Boston Herald: Clean-cut Romney GOP Pick in '08

BILL: President Bush lashed out at critics within his own party
Tuesday, accusing Republican opponents of distorting the
immigration deal he negotiated with leading congressional
Democrats and playing on the politics of fear to undermine
public support. In stern tones normally reserved for the
liberal opposition, Bush said conservatives fighting the
immigration proposal "haven't read the bill" and oppose it in
some cases because "it might make somebody else look good."
Their "empty political rhetoric," he said, threatens to thwart
what he called the last, best chance to fix an immigration
system that all sides agree is broken. Washington Post: Bush

LIMITS BIAS SUITS: A Supreme Court once again split by the
thinnest of margins ruled yesterday that workers may not sue
their employers over unequal pay caused by discrimination
alleged to have occurred years earlier. The court ruled 5 to 4
that Lilly Ledbetter, the lone female supervisor at a tire
plant in Gadsden, Ala., did not file her lawsuit against
Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. in the timely manner specified by
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The decision moved
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to read a dissent from the bench, a
usually rare practice that she has now employed twice in the
past six weeks to criticize the majority for opinions that she
said undermine women's rights. Washington Post:  Over

BILLION TO FIGHT AIDS: President Bush will call on Congress
today to provide $30 billion toward battling the global AIDS
crisis over the first five years after he leaves office,
according to senior administration officials, a doubling of the
current U.S. commitment. The increase in the President's
Emergency Program for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) would provide
lifesaving treatment to 2.5 million people, administration
officials said last night -- about 1.4 million more than the
program now serves. The program's original five-year mandate,
which provided for $15 billion in U.S. funding, will expire in
September 2008. Bush's plan would extend that five more years.

INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES OUTMODED: As the Bush administration
completes secret new rules governing interrogations, a group of
experts advising the intelligence agencies are arguing that the
harsh techniques used since the 2001 terrorist attacks are
outmoded, amateurish and unreliable. The psychologists and
other specialists, commissioned by the Intelligence Science
Board, make the case that more than five years after the Sept.
11 attacks, the Bush administration has yet to create an elite
corps of interrogators trained to glean secrets from terrorism
suspects. While billions are spent each year to upgrade
satellites and other high-tech spy machinery, the experts say,
interrogation methods — possibly the most important source of
information on groups like Al Qaeda — are a hodgepodge that
date from the 1950s, or are modeled on old Soviet practices.

IMMIGRATION APPLICATION FEES: The Bush administration will
announce increases in immigration application fees Wednesday
that will nearly double the cost of citizenship and almost
triple the cost of becoming a legal permanent resident. The new
fees, reflecting an average 66 percent increase from current
costs, led immigrant advocates and some members of Congress to
criticize them as a "wall" that could bar poorer immigrants
from attaining citizenship. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration
Services officials countered that the increases were essential
to help the overloaded agency reduce its backlog and speed up
service. "The reason we're raising the fees, short answer, is
that we need the money," said Emilio Gonzales, director of
Citizenship and Immigration Services. "A lot of people are
going to be affected by this, there's no sugar-coating it." Los

GETTING WEARY OVER IRAQ: Through four elections, Debbie
Thompson has supported Representative Mark Steven Kirk, a
Republican and staunch backer of the Bush administration’s
policies in Iraq. But Ms. Thompson, a mother of two from this
affluent suburb of Chicago, says her views on the war have
evolved, and she now wants Mr. Kirk to change, too. Though
voters here in the 10th Congressional District have elected a
Republican to the House for as long as anyone can remember,
there is a newfound hostility about the war that is being
directed toward Mr. Kirk, who was narrowly re-elected to a
fourth term last November. Nor is Mr. Kirk alone in his
struggle to appease increasingly restless constituents. He and
10 other Republicans in Congress recently delivered a warning
to President Bush that conditions in Iraq needed to improve
soon because public support of the war was crumbling. New York

Barack Obama on Tuesday sought to address an issue that polls
show greatly concerns voters, as he offered a health-care plan
that pledged to insure all children and provide better access
to health insurance for adults by lowering costs. The
presidential candidate and Illinois Democrat placed himself in
the center of his party's mainstream with a plan that relies
heavily on the promise of cost savings through a big investment
in technology but also would be funded in part by allowing
President Bush's tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans to
expire. The proposal is not quite as sweeping as that offered
by former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards, experts said, while
Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) has not yet offered a
fully fleshed-out plan. Chicago Tribune: Obama offers health

PROTEST: Cindy Sheehan, the anti-war activist who spent the
last two years trying to confront President Bush and traveling
around the world in protest of the Iraq war, says she will now
try a new tactic -- silence. Sheehan announced on a liberal Web
site on Monday that she was ending her role as the face of the
American peace movement, leaving Texas to return to California,
her home state, to "be a mother to my surviving children and
try to regain some of what I lost." In what she described as a
"resignation letter," Sheehan wrote in her online diary on the
Daily Kos blog: "Good-bye America ... you are not the country
that I love and I finally realized no matter how much I
sacrifice, I can't make you be that country unless you want it.
It's up to you now." Chicago Tribune: Sheehan ends her protest

follows months of political courtship on both coasts. Clinton

NEW YORK BIRTHDAY BASH: Presidential hopeful Rudy Giuliani
celebrated his 63rd birthday with fund-raising bashes across
the city yesterday -- while defending his record on 9/11. "I
love it. It reminds me of the old days of traveling around New
York City doing five boroughs in one day," said Giuliani,
before entering the second fund-raising event at Spielaston
Manor in Queens. The four galas for Giuliani, whose actual
birthday was Monday, also included events in City Island,
Bronx; Bay Ridge, Brooklyn; and Staten Island. They generated
$500,000, a campaign insider said. At two of the events,
families of firefighters killed on 9/11 blasted Giuliani for
inadequate planning for a terrorist attack. New York Post:

Speculation over whether Fred Thompson is serious about running
for president just went toes-up. Mr. Thompson's not-yet-a
campaign has confirmed: He's dipping his toes in. Specifically,
a Thompson adviser told The New York Sun yesterday, he will
announce the formation of a presidential "testing-the-waters"
committee early next week -- possibly as early as Sunday. A
"testing the waters" committee is a step before the more
familiar presidential exploratory committee. It allows the
former Tennessee senator to raise money and hire staff. But it
also prevents him from doing a number of other things:
advertising his candidacy, referring to himself as a real
candidate (presumably just in public, he can say whatever he
likes in front of the bathroom mirror), raising money that
could be transferred to another candidate, or raising money to
get on the ballot. New York Sun: Thompson to dip his toes

<br>CLINTON SAYS FAVORS FOR BIG BUSINESS MUST END: Criticizing
tax breaks for the wealthy and subsidies for corporations that
ship jobs overseas, Sen. Hillary Clinton said yesterday she
would outlaw special favors to big business as part of her "new
progressive vision for this new century." Clinton said she her
nine-point program would restore the balance that has been lost
during the Bush Administration, which has seen productivity
rise and corporate profits rise while family incomes have
fallen. "I think a lot of people would like to go back six
years and push the restart button on the 21st Century, and do
it all over again the right way," Clinton told a crowd of about
200 at the Manchester School of Technology. "The past six years
it is as if we have gone back to the era of the robber barons."

DEMOCRATIC RIVALS FLIP-FLOPPED ON IRAQ FUNDING: Democratic
presidential candidate Joe Biden on Tuesday said his rivals for
the 2008 nomination who are fellow U.S. senators voted against
protecting U.S. troops in Iraq last week, and switched their
positions in the process. "As long as there are troops who are
in a position where, if we don’t fund them they are going to be
hurt, I'm not going to cut off funding," Biden said during a
meeting with Des Moines Register editors and reporters "That's
what the other candidates said too, but they changed their
mind." Biden was referring to last week's vote on a
supplemental bill to finance the war in Iraq. The measure
passed with bipartisan support after language calling for a
timetable for troop withdrawal was removed. Des Moines

HIS OWN CAMPAIGN RULES: Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) isn't
playing it by the book. As other White House hopefuls for the
Democratic nomination scramble to attend every major event in
key primary states, Obama picks and chooses. And while
Democratic candidates court their liberal base, Obama has not
been afraid to offend influential constituents in the
Democratic Party. Some have labeled Obama’s campaign as
error-prone; others simply call it unconventional. Obama will
be the only Democratic presidential candidate who doesn’t
attend at least one of two major state Democratic functions in
the early-voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire this
Saturday. The Hill: Obama won't play by the book

PRESIDENTIAL SALARY TO CHARITY: Campaigning in New Hampshire
yesterday, Mitt Romney said he would not take a salary if
elected president and would instead donate the money to
charity. "When I got started, I went to school and I never
anticipated that I'd be as financially successful as I was, and
then my business went far better than I expected it would,"
Romney said at a question-and-answer session at insurer Liberty
Mutual in Dover, according to the Associated Press. Romney, who
did not take a salary during his four years as Massachusetts
governor, later told reporters he would probably accept the
$400,000 presidential salary but give the money away. "I
presume I would take the salary and then I would donate at
least that amount -- or more -- to charity," Romney said, the
AP reported. Boston Globe: Romney says he'd forgo president's

<br>AFFLECK: 'KEN DOLL' ROMNEY WILL WIN GOP NOMINATION: "Gone,
Baby, Gone" director Ben Affleck, who tried mightily -- but
unsuccessfully -- to get Sen. John Kerry elected to the White
House, said he expects ex-Gov. Mitt Romney to be the Republican
nominee in 2008. Chatting about the upcoming presidential race
on the season finale of "Real Time with Bill Maher," the
Cambridge homey said he thinks the GOP will end up with Romney
because the ex-gov looks good, has nice hair - and the
Republicans really don't have anyone else. He says he doesn't
like abortion and he's all clean-cut and he looks like a Ken
doll," said Affleck who was doing a rather amusing imitation of
our ex-gov during the Romney rant. "The Mormonism thing is
really suspect," he added, "but they'll take it at this point.
I mean, who else do they have? Crazy (Rudy) Giuliani and (John)
McCain who's completely insane? They don't have any other
options." Boston Herald: Clean-cut Romney GOP Pick in '08
