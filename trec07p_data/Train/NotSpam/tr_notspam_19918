Summary: Perl treats quoted Pod as quoted text, and all other Pod as
comments; Pod treats all Pod as Pod.

Effects:
1. You trade the brutally surprising behavior of whole lines of string
literal content vanishing for the much more subtle surprising behavior
of whole lines of string literal content being available via $=pod
variables (some might consider the latter to be a feature).
2. Pod Sections behave just like block comments (aside from the pod
variables thing), which is very nice.
3. There will be a few rare cases where the Perl programmer will need
to cheat to keep something that looks like Pod from registering as
Pod; this will be easy enough to do when it's needed.

Opinion: That's a significant trade up, and addresses my biggest concerns.

The only other thing that I'll continue to lobby for is that the line
starting with a block comment's termination tag should _not_ be
considered part of the comment, save for the termination tag itself.
Programmers are likely to be surprised when text that follows a
closing bracket is treated as being included within it.
