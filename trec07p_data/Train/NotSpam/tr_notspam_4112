Napster Set to Launch Over-the-Air Music Subscription Service in Japan

NTT DoCoMo to Support Service with New Series of Handsets and Will Offer
Wireless Customers Integrated Billing of New Napster Service 


LOS ANGELES, April 23, 2007 /PRNewswire-FirstCall via COMTEX News
Network/ -- Napster (Nasdaq: NAPS) today announced that the company will
soon launch the first deployment of its over-the-air (OTA) music
subscription service through Napster Japan, a joint venture between the
company and Tower Records Japan, with NTT DoCoMo, Japan's largest
wireless carrier. The service will be the first deployment of Napster's
OTA music subscription service and will provide DoCoMo's customers with
wireless access to Napster's unlimited listening and downloading music
experience with full integration with Napster's industry leading
PC-based subscription service. 

The new Napster OTA service will be available to DoCoMo's iMode
subscribers via the soon-to-be-released 904i series of handsets, as
announced today in Japan by DoCoMo. Napster's OTA music subscription
service is an extension of the company's award-winning Napster To Go PC
service, which enables unlimited downloading and transfer of tracks for
one low monthly fee to compatible portable digital music devices and
cell phones. Napster's new OTA subscription functionality will be
available to DoCoMo's customers as an extension of the Napster To Go
service at no additional cost and will be available to both new and
current Napster To Go customers. 

"Launching our music subscription product on a wireless platform is a
landmark for Napster and we are honored to be delivering this cutting
edge innovation with DoCoMo, one of the world's largest and most
innovative wireless carriers," said Chris Gorog, chairman & CEO of
Napster. "Napster's mission is to provide consumers with unlimited
access to the world's music - anytime and anywhere - and we are proud to
announce this latest achievement with our joint venture partner Tower
Records Japan." 

In addition to receiving full-length songs directly on their mobile
handsets, when subscribers use the Napster To Go OTA service to download
songs without connecting to a PC those tracks will be "bookmarked" and
added to their PC collection. Further integrating the PC and OTA
experience, users of the Napster To Go OTA service will be able to view
Playlists available on the PC and download them directly to their
handsets over-the-air. Users of the 904i series of DoCoMo phones will
also still enjoy the option of side-loading content from the PC onto
their phones, as with any other Napster To Go compatible portable music
device. 

In another first, Napster will offer the ability to integrate billing
for the Napster To Go service directly into a user's NTT DoCoMo mobile
phone bill. 904i series handset users will have the option to sign up
for Napster To Go directly through their handsets and select integrated
billing at the time of registration.
