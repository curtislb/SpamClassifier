I think so but people don't seem to always assert it. Does the work get 
this automatically? How does it interact with the underlying copyright?

I can see the case that the collective work couldn't exist without the 
underlying CC-licensed work so the condition for being allowed to claim 
a collective copyright that covers the CC-licensed work is that the 
collective work must be CC-licensed. I'm just very wary of it.

As a whole it is copyrighted by the publisher, there is usually a notice 
on the contents page. Writers and illustrators and editors get 
attribution. I must admit I haven't thought about what kind of copyright 
this is. Photos from agencies must have their own copyright originally 
and be licensed.

Stallman explicitly excluded collective works when drafting the GPL. 
This was a tactical measure at least in part I believe, as no 
Freeware/Shareware CD would have accepted those terms.

It is also important to avoid anything that could be regarded as coercion.

> Or am I totally off base.

No, I'm just very wary of collective copyright. Part of this is ethical, 
part of this is due to my not having the best understanding of it.  :-/

I understand the collective copyright argument but I think unless it is 
used very precisely to enforce a particular part of a "social contract" 
it could be seen as coercive and harm distribution without increasing or 
protecting copyleft works.

I would be interested to see a study of how collective work copyrights 
could interact with alternative copyright licenses though.
