6:59 PM, 6/17/07, Update: Spacewalk ends; all major objectives accomplished=
 (UPDATED at 10:20 PM with flight director wrapup)

Astronauts Pat Forrester and Steve Swanson put the finishing touches on a d=
ramatic space station assembly mission today, completing a fourth and final=
 spacewalk to activate a new solar array rotation mechanism and ready the l=
ab complex for a critical sequence of upcoming construction flights.

"I couldn't be more pleased," said lead space station Flight Director Kelly=
 Beck. "The complexity of the tasks that we had was a challenge and the cre=
w just executed perfectly. But then to throw in the Russian segment compute=
r problems we had and still come out of this mission with everything done t=
hat we planned to have done is just a real success and we're very proud of =
it."

Today's spacewalk began at 12:25 p.m. and ended with the start of airlock r=
epressurization at 6:54 p.m. This was the fourth and final spacewalk for th=
e Atlantis astronauts, pushing the crew's total to 27 hours and 58 minutes.=
 Forrester and Swanson logged a total of 13 hours and 45 minutes for the se=
cond and fourth EVAs while Reilly and Danny Olivas put in 14 hours and 13 m=
inutes during the first and third outings.

Overall, this was the 87th spacewalk devoted to space station assembly and =
maintenance since construction began in 1998. With today 's EVA, 48 U.S. as=
tronauts, 15 Russian cosmonauts, two Canadians and four astronauts represen=
ting Japan, Germany, France and Sweden have logged 537 hours and three minu=
tes of EVA time building and maintaining the space station.

"It's time for you to come on in," astronaut Jim Reilly radioed from Atlant=
is' flight deck as the spacewalkers wound up a long day.

"I'll take one last look and if I could, just say happy Father's Day," Forr=
ester replied. "It's been a great way to spend it. I want to say happy Fath=
er's Day to my Dad, my father-in-law and for being a father to my two sons.=
 So thanks."

"I'd like to echo the same words," Swanson called. "Thanks for reminding me=
."

"Absolutely," Reilly said, "a lot of fathers on this flight and we're all e=
njoying a great Father's Day."

The primary goal of today's spacewalk was an inspection of the drive motors=
 on the starboard solar alpha rotary joint - SARJ - on the right side of th=
e station's main solar power truss; removal of a final few launch locks to =
permit free rotation; stowage of a keel pin used to anchor the S3/24 truss =
element in the shuttle's cargo bay during launch; and installation of a saf=
ety stop on the end of the track used by the station's robot arm-carrying m=
obile transporter.

The spacewalkers also ran a computer cable that eventually will permit astr=
onauts in the U.S. segment of the station to command systems in the Russian=
 segment. They opened a newly installed hydrogen valve that is part of a ne=
w U.S. oxygen generation system and attempted to bolt down a micrometeoroid=
 debris shield that could not be put back in place during an earlier spacew=
alk. Swanson and Forrester were not able to get it anchored, either, so the=
y used tethers to lash it down.

"They completed the remainder of the tasks that we were hoping to accomplis=
h on this mission," Beck said. "They finished preparing the solar alpha rot=
ary joint, so now it is released and free to move. They also cleared the tr=
anslation path to work site one, which is the new (robot arm) work site tha=
t came up on this truss.

"They also opened the oxygen generator system vent valve, that's a valve th=
at Jim Reilly actually installed on the third spacewalk. The configuration =
was done yesterday by Clay Anderson inside so that we could actually open t=
hat valve today. And that was completed. We also had some miscellaneous ite=
ms that put us a little bit ahead for future missions, things like relocati=
ng foot restraints and they also did routing of a node LAN cable ... that g=
ives them a hardline connection between the Russian segment and U.S. segmen=
t laptops. So excellent day today.

"Again, with the completion of this fourth spacewalk," Beck said, "we compl=
eted all of the EVA objectives that we were planning and then some."

Overnight, ground controllers will test the SARJ, ordering a small 5-degree=
 rotation just to verify normal operations. The S3 rotary joint will be swi=
tched into auto-track mode, turning the newly installed S4 solar arrays to =
stay face-on to the sun, early Monday, after the crew is awake to monitor t=
he operation.

At that point, the station's orientation, or attitude, will be maintained b=
y the lab's control moment gyroscopes. But after a shuttle water dump, grou=
nd controllers will carry out a critical test to make sure the revived Russ=
ian flight computers can control the station's orientation with Russian roc=
ket thrusters.

"They have good confidence all the software's running appropriately," Beck =
said. "There are a few systems items they still need to clean up, but it lo=
oks like it's in good shape. Tomorrow, we will have sort of an extra-double=
 check, if you will, to make sure everything is running well."

With the shuttle-station complex under the control of Atlantis' rocket thru=
sters, "we're actually going to hand over attitude control to the Russian s=
egment and control with Russian thrusters and then we'll hand over to momen=
tum (gyro) management," Beck said. If all goes well, "that will finish chec=
king out all the different attitude control systems. Again, we're confident=
 it's going to work but it will be a good double check just to make sure ev=
erything's in the proper configuration."

Assuming no problems develop and engineers confirm the Russian guidance and=
 navigation system can, in fact, orient the space station as required, the =
Atlantis astronauts will be cleared to undock on Tuesday.

"The shuttle crew has some off-duty time (Monday), but then they'll be spen=
ding the rest of the day with the station crew packing up last-minute items=
, making sure all the equipment and transfer items are on the right side of=
 the hatch," Beck said. "At the end of the day, they'll say their final goo=
dbyes and then they'll close the hatches in preparation for undocking the n=
ext day."
