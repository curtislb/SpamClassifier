						Today's Quote for the Day:=20
<br>

<br>
"What changed everything for women was not feminism or exercise but hair dy=
e. It almost never gets the credit but it is partly responsible for women b=
eing able to stay in the job market" - Writer Nora Ephron, of Sleepless in =
Seattle fame.
<br>

<br>
In tonight's programme:
<br>

<br>
<b>THE ECONOMY </b>
<br>

<br>
Ten years after the creation of the Monetary Policy Committee to take contr=
ol of interest rates, the Bank of England Governor has been forced to write=
 a letter explaining why inflation is more than 1% above the Bank's target.=
=20
<br>

<br>
It comes as a group of economists urges the MPC to be more hawkish on infla=
tion, and with an increasing political debate about the public finances. We=
'll explain what's going on - what might be going wrong - and the political=
 impact on Zombie Brown.=20
<br>

<br>
<b>IRAQ</b>
<br>

<br>
The battle comes to Washington. George Bush has refused once again to set a=
 timetable for withdrawing US troops from Iraq and says he will veto the em=
ergency Iraq war-funding bill proposed by the Democrats which states that t=
roops should begin withdrawing by October.=20
<br>

<br>
The Democrats say they won't back down. Yesterday in one of the worst attac=
ks on US troops since March 2003, a further nine US soldiers were killed. S=
o has America lost the war?=20
<br>

<br>
<b>SCOTLAND </b>
<br>

<br>
For the first time it looks as though the Scottish National Party could be =
the biggest party in the Scottish parliament. Is this really the first step=
 towards the break up of the Union - or simply a sign of disillusionment wi=
th Labour as the natural party of government North of the Border?=20
<br>

<br>
David Grossman will figure it out.=20
<br>
=20
<br>
<b>AND FINALLY...</b>
<br>

<br>
Retaliation for yesterday's anti-Arsenal joke was swift. It came from Newsn=
ight viewer Roy who, I think it can be assumed, is not a fan of Tottenham H=
otspur:=20
<br>

<br>
"Why is it impossible to get a cup of tea at White Hart lane?=20=20
<br>

<br>
Because all the mugs are on the pitch - and all the cups are at Arsenal."
<br>

<br>
Newsnight is at 10.30 pm on BBC2.
