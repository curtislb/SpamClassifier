To make this even more tricky, if the user shows up in even one of the second
hashes the whole %$dept hash is affected.

We have $dept{customer}{user}
        $dept{customer}{user1}
        $dept{customer1}{user}
	$dept{customer1{user1}
	$dept{customer2}{user}

So, even though user2 isn't found in either customer's or customer1's hashes,
its existence in customer2's hash means that all work will be done on the
preceding two hashes as well.

Keep up with me and what I'm up to: http://theillien.blogspot.com
