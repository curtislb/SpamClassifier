I recently started using LWP::UserAgent to access some HTTPS sites  
and ran into a problem that doesn't easily present a solution.

I have one site that I can connect to and use with great success  
using HTTPS.
I have another where the site owner gave me a certificate on file to  
use for authentication and encryption to that site.
I can't get it to work.

It appears that the SSL layer just balks at the use of the certificate.

Right now I'm wondering if there is anyone who has experience with  
this or knows someplace that I can try.
I'm using Crypt::SSLeay as the SSL part.

help?
