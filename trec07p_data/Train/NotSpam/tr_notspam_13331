expanded a program that it says will [1]reduce flight delays during the

weather receive the maximum number of flights that can safely fly to
them."

Seymour writes "Novell and the EFF have announced that Novell will be
contributing to the [0]EFF's Patent Busting Project. Novell will also
[1]support the EFF's efforts toward patent reform, including with the
WIPO. Could this be Novell trying to get back in the good graces of Linux
users? 'Novell's agreement with Microsoft has been a source of contention
within open source circles, with one Red Hat executive accusing the
company of appeasing Microsoft; others have accused Novell of violating
the GPL with the agreement. Either way, signing the deal with Microsoft
did a lot to sully Novell in the eyes of many Linux users, and Novell's
decision to link up with the EFF on patents may have been made with an
eye towards getting some of its street cred back with the OSS
community.'"

[0]PetManimal writes "David Ulevitch, the founder of OpenDNS, [1]claims
that Google and Dell have placed 'spyware' on Dell computers. Ulevitch
made the claim based on his observation of the behavior of the Google
Toolbar and homepage that comes preinstalled on IE in new Dell machines.
He says that a browser redirector sends users who enter nonexistent URLs
to a Dell-branded page loaded with Google ads. Another observer, Danny
Sullivan, says that [2]this is a different result than what happens on
PCs without the redirector. However, the original article notes that
Ulevitch has a vested interest in the results of mistyped URLs."

Frequent Slashdot contributor [0]Bennett Haselton gives the
full-disclosure treatment to the widely known and surprisingly simple
technique for finding treasure-troves of credit card numbers online. He
points out how the credit-card companies could plug this hole at trivial
expense, saving themselves untold millions in losses from bogus
transactions, and saving their customers some serious hassles. Read on

Education and Skills, found that some teachers are reluctant to teach

whose beliefs include Holocaust denial. Additionally, similar problems
are being encountered with lessons on [3]the Crusades because these

places where we're not doing that perfectly today.'"

aalobode sends us to an article up at BusinessWeek about Intel's design
for a [0]new, ultra-thin laptop â almost as thin as a Razr â designed as
a [1]fashion accessory. Intel hopes to get the high end of the laptop
market growing faster, and so they are particularly targeting female
consumers with the new model. It's unlikely that all of the advanced
features in this prototype will make it into products, and if they did
the resulting laptops would command a daunting price. One feature we can
hope makes the cut is built-in cellular Internet access. From the
article: "The result, code-named Intel mobile Metro notebook, is less
than 0.7 inches thick â about one-quarter of an inch thicker than
Motorola's iconic cell phone, making it the world's thinnest notebook.
And at 2.25 pounds, it's also one of the lightest small-sized portable
computers. Other features include always-on Internet connectivity via
various wireless technologies."

bloggers yesterday with a survey showing that 49 out of the 50 WordPress
blogs he checked seem to be [1]running exploitable versions of the widely

awareness amongst bloggers with a non-technical background, and even
those with a technical background.' Mr Kierznowski also uncovered recent
[2]vulnerabilities in WordPress plugins that ship by default with the
software, adding: 'WordPress users developing plugins must be aware of
the security functions that WordPress supports, and ensure that these
functions are used in their code.'"

[0]lisah writes "While the One Laptop Per Child project pulled itself
together and [1]shipped its first Beta machines, Intel was busy
developing its own version, the Classmate PC. Inevitable comparisons will
be made between the two (especially since OLPC's chairman Nicholas
Negroponte [2]called Intel's move "predatory"), so Linux.com's Tina
Gasperson and her kids [3]took a Classmate PC for a test run to see how
it does in the real world. The upshot? Good battery life, easy to use,
and great with ketchup. 'The Classmate is so adorably cozy it make you
want to snuggle up on a comfy couch or lean back on some pillows on the
floor while you surf. Good thing wireless is built right in. Too bad the
typical Linux foibles apply. The first snag was having to log in as root
to check the system configuration because the Classmate wouldn't log on
to the network. Something tells me most elementary and high school
teachers with nothing but Windows experience aren't going to get that.'"

[0]DJAdapt writes "In a departure from Dell's approach of selling
machines only directly to customers, a Dell spokesman said Thursday that
the computer maker will begin [1]selling two of its Dimension desktop
computers in about 3,000 Wal-Marts beginning June 10. Dell spokesman
Dwayne Cox said the Wal-Mart deal 'represents our first step' into global
retail. 'Customers want more and new ways to buy our products, and we
plan on meeting their needs on a global level,' Cox said. 'Offering Dell
Dimensions in Wal-Mart is a great example of this approach.'"

bob_dinosaur writes "According to The Register, Microsoft's Patent
Attorney Jim Markwith told the Open Source Business Conference that the
reason they hadn't named the supposedly infringing patents was that it
would be '[0]administratively impossible to keep up' with the list.
'According to Ramji, the executive tasked with the difficult job of
straddling Microsoft's growing support for open source in server and
tools, and aggressive and unpredictable statements from management on
patents, made a jaw dropping attempt to explain away the Forbes article.
"The reason we disclosed that, is because there was a request for
transparency following the Novell deal Iast November. This was a response
to that transparency," Ramji said. It was at that point the OSBC audience
erupted.'" That transparency apparently extends to multiple levels. ZDNet
is reporting that [1]Novell will share the details of its agreement with
Microsoft sometime in the near future.

managers give up technical skills to develop management skills."

kooky45 asks: "In an effort to make our lives easier and more
entertaining, technology designers pack more and more features into
electronic devices, but often they're more nuisance than they're worth.
[0]An earlier article on LEDs discussed some of these. Another example is
my Nokia 6320i mobile phone which has a back lit screen that drains the
battery life at an alarming rate. When the phone is not in use the back
light is off; if the battery starts to run low, it gives me regular
warnings by beeping and turning the back light on! What other examples of
designer stupidity have you seen?"

An anonymous reader writes "HD DVD fans learned a valuable lesson in
'don't believe everything you read' this week, after the trade
publication Home Media Magazine reported that the HD DVD camp planned to
[0]release more than 20x the number of releases planned on Blu-ray
through the end of 2007. The suggestion was so preposterous that even the
official HD DVD Promotions Group (which has the most to gain from the
spread of such misinformation) has requested a correction. 'Contacted for
comment, the HD DVD Promotional Group told us that the Home Media
Magazine report was incorrect. The group says it "conservatively"
projects a worldwide total of 600 HD DVD releases for the entirety of
2007, and that the error in the report appeared to stem from a slide in
an HD DVD powerpoint presentation that listed the cumulative number of
titles by month for 2006. The Home Media Magazine report also quoted a
Blu-ray spokesperson as saying that Blu-ray-affiliated studios will
release a total of 43 titles in 2007. This number also appears to be
incorrect, given that 160 titles have already been announced through
September in the U.S. alone.'"

[0]putting CAPTCHAs to work for the good of humanity. A scientist at
Carnegie Mellon is looking to create a new type of security check that
will assist in a project meant to digitize and make searchable text from
books and printed materials. Above and beyond that, the offering would
probably be more secure than most current systems. "Instead of requiring
visitors to retype random numbers and letters, they would retype text
that otherwise is difficult for the optical character recognition systems
to decipher when being used to digitize books and other printed
materials. The translated text would then go toward the digitization of
the printed material on behalf of the Internet Archive project."
