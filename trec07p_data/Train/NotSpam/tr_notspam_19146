8:22 AM, 6/14/07, Update: Russian computer system partially revived; troubl=
eshooting continues=20

Engineers have re-established communications with at least one part of the =
space station's Russian guidance and command-and-control computers. They ar=
e receiving a full stream of telemetry and have been able to restore power =
to critical systems.

The navigation system and command computers feature three redundant data pa=
ths and only one path, or lane, has been re-established. Troubleshooting co=
ntinues, but engineers have restored station power to systems in the Zvezda=
 and Zarya modules. The crew's Soyuz lifeboat, which was put on internal po=
wer late Wednesday as a precaution, also was switched back to station power.

Details were sketchy, but a NASA official said commanding to the one restor=
ed computer lane had been restored and the Russians could, if necessary, us=
e it to adjust the space station's orientation by firing Russian rocket thr=
usters.

Attitude control is critical to keeping the lab's solar arrays properly ori=
ented and to preventing sensitive systems from getting too hot or too cold.=
 The guidance computer system must be operational before the shuttle Atlant=
is departs next week.

During the station's next pass over Russian ground stations later this morn=
ing, commands will be uplinked in a bid to restart lanes two and three. It =
is not yet clear whether the Russians have tracked down the root cause of t=
he problem or whether it could happen again.

Russian engineers speculated Wednesday that the failures may have been rela=
ted to the installation of a new U .S. solar array Monday. Early today, the=
y isolated the Russian segment from U.S. power while they worked to restart=
 the computers. U.S. power later was restored with no apparent problem.
