Look at how aeq is called. The lengths of the arrays are passed before the 
arrays. If the lengths are correct, the lengths are what the calls to shift 
should return. Using these lengths and an offset of 0 should ensure that 
splice removes all elements of the arrays following the length arguments. 
So, "my(@a) = splice(@_,0,shift);" assigns to @a the values from the first 
array in the call to aeq and "my(@b) = splice(@_,0,shift);" assigns to @b the 
values from the second array in the call to aeq. Then, the lengths of the two 
arrays are compared, and finally, all their elements are compared.
