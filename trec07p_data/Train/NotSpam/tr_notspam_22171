Hi Aneto,

Git still relies on a mudball of shell and Perl scripts, so getting itrunning under Windows proper is an uphill battle. The recommended way todo it is to first set up Cygwin, which might be more trouble than you'rewilling to go through. Even then, it'll run quite slowly because ofcertain FS ops being substantially slower on Windows than on Linux.

As root, 'yum install git-core' should do it.

Please provide more details. Memory allocation shouldn't *crash* themachine under any (reasonable set of) circumstances; the OOM killermight kick in and destroy a few processes, however. In your case, you'reallocating less than a meg, so something is certainly wrong if it'scrashing. What kind of crash are you getting? Can you post the code andthe images somewhere where we can test this?
