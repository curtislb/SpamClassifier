Just to underline this some more in case it's still not clear why this
is a fee, or even why if not it should not be allowed for licences in
main:

This clause is on the continuum of clauses that ends in clauses like
"in any court action concerning this license you automatically lose."

Whether you agree with the fee argument or not, such clauses have no
business being in main because by using software under such a license
you either give up rights that you had or at least potentially give
them up. When you are ceding rights, interest, money, or other
intangibles to the licensor or original author, you are paying them
for using their software in a form of currency.
