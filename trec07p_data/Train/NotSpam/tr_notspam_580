So, IIUC, ready-to-use videos are created by extracting and compressing
appropriate sequences of the original uncompressed videos.
The original uncompressed form is kept in case some modifications are
needed.
This really seems to mean that the original uncompressed form is
actually the source form.

The extraction/compression process is automated via Makefiles: this is
good and really helpful.

So, you seem to have a problem with big sources.
The problem lies in the technical difficulties that arise when you want
to distribute the complete source of the game (that includes the big
uncompressed videos).
However, I suppose the problem is not only in *public* distribution.
How do you handle the problem when you want to perform distribution of
video source *inside* the project?
I mean: I hope those source videos are kept by *more* than one single
project member!  Otherwise your game project has a really low bus number
(equal to 1, as far as videos are concerned!).
How do you copy a big uncompressed video to other project members?

This is unfortunate, as it poses downstream recipients in a position of
disadvantage with respect to upstream maintainers.
