Boss's Antiques Rogue Show

GANGLAND Godfather Terry Adams fancied himself as an ANTIQUES expert ? like
TV rogue Lovejoy, it has emerged.

Adams ? linked to 25 murders ? had a ?700,000 collection of mainly stolen
valuables, including his prized ?120,000 porcelain figures.  
 
 Other pinched items included ?60,000 Bluejohn vases, ?8,000 Ormolu
candlesticks and work by Picasso and Brit artist Henry Moore worth ?35,000. 

Adams, 52, is serving seven years? jail for money laundering and a source
close to his trial said: ?There?s no doubt he thought of himself as a
collector.?

The items were stolen in thefts dating back to 1991. Insurance firms, which
have long since paid out, will now take possession of the valuables. 

A Serious Organised Crime Agency spokesman said: ?This is not to suggest
Adams was involved in their theft, or that he was aware they were stolen.?

The collection was uncovered during a raid on Adams? mansion in Barnet,
North London.

'Monument Man': World War II veteran honored for saving art
By ROB HOTAKAINEN
The Star's Washington Correspondent

WASHINGTON | Stationed in Germany during World War II, James Reeds was the
chief clerk for a little office with a big mission: rescuing art that had
been looted by Nazis.

On Wednesday, the 85-year-old man from Kansas City squinted into the bright
television lights on Capitol Hill, clutching an American flag with both
hands. His hair and beard were white. He walked with a cane and spoke
slowly.

"I think we did a good thing in that war," Reeds said. "We conquered the
Nazis and their friends and we did very good things to protect people from
the sins of the Nazis. . I'm glad to be an American."

On the 63rd anniversary of D-Day, Congress paused to honor Reeds and three
other members of the so-called Monuments Men. They were a small band of arts
experts that tracked down tens of thousands of pieces of stolen art and
cultural artifacts by masters such as Michelangelo, Rembrandt, Picasso and
DaVinci.

"This is long overdue," said Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Texas Republican
who presented flags to the four men: Reeds, Horace Apgar of Oklahoma, Harry
Ettinger of New Jersey, and Bernard Taper of California.

Revealed: the stolen art found at home of crime boss Adams


? Police found 'Aladdin's cave' of treasures
? Many owners traced after raid on mansion 

Sandra Laville, crime correspondent
Thursday June 7, 2007
The Guardian 


A treasure trove of stolen art and antiques, which was discovered in the ?2m
mansion belonging to the London crime boss Terry Adams, can be revealed
today.
When detectives arrested the north London godfather in September 2003 they
found what they later described as an Aladdin's cave of treasures gracing
his home. Most of the property was found to have been stolen from country
houses, art galleries and museums over the last 10-15 years. Many of the
antiques had been packed into cases and were apparently about to be moved
when police arrived.

While Adams was arrested on suspicion of laundering part of his multimillion
crime fortune, officers catalogued the store of art and antiques, removed it
to a warehouse, and called in experts to identify it.
Working with the Art Loss Register and officers from the arts and antiques
squad at Scotland Yard, detectives from the National Crime Squad, which
later became the Serious and Organised Crime Agency, attempted to find where
the property had originally come from. They managed to trace the owners of
?274,000 worth of the stolen art and antiques and yesterday released
pictures of some of the returned items to the Guardian.

Victims of the burglaries included an 85-year-old woman from Sherborne,
Dorset, whose ?2,000 Chinese lacquered Davenport writing bureau was stolen
in 1992; a leading London gallery, the Marlborough, which had three Henry
Moore prints and three Picasso etchings worth ?35,000 stolen in 1997; the
Library Museum of the Freemasons, which lost five pieces of Meissen
porcelain worth ?120,000 in two thefts in 1991 and 1996; and Asprey's
auction house, which lost a pair of Bluejohn Cassolette vases worth ?60,000
in 1996.

However, the Sherborne victim, who did not want to be named, has still not
gained possession of her bureau.

She said yesterday: "By the time the police found it, the insurance company
had paid out on it. It is now in their possession and I don't think I can
afford to buy it back, which is a shame."

Hugo Gorst-Williams, of the recovery section of the Art Loss Register, which
holds details of 170,000 items of stolen art and antiques on its database,
said he was called in by police shortly after Adams' arrest in 2003.

"At the time, we did not know the property was found at his house. There was
a major investigation going on and the police kept the information very
close," he said. "They rang us to say they had discovered an Aladdin's cave
and asked for our help. It was only much later we were told the items had
been found in Terry Adams' home."

Detectives sent a list of the items, which were worth more than ?500,000 in
all, to experts at the Art Loss Register. "We were able to match up some of
the items very quickly with our database," said Mr Gorst-Williams.

Adams was jailed for seven years in March after pleading guilty to
laundering ?1m of his multimillion pound criminal fortune. Adams and his
brothers Tommy and Patsy, who were known as the A-team, ran an empire based
on loan sharking, protection rackets and money laundering through the Hatton
Garden gem district of central London.

The family's financial adviser, Solly Nahome, who arranged for ?25m of the
family's criminal income to be hidden in property deals and offshore
accounts, was shot dead outside his home, throwing the family's financial
affairs into chaos.

After decades of cheating justice, Adams was caught after the Inland Revenue
investigated his lavish lifestyle in the mid-1990s. He offered to settle
with them for ?95,000 in 1996, but the (now defunct) National Crime Squad
launched a ?50m joint investigation with MI5.

A specialist police team spent 21 months bugging Adams' home to provide
evidence that he was living off proceeds of crime while claiming he had a
legitimate income.

The stolen art works were found when officers raided Adams's home in Mill
Hill, north London, in September 2003. In addition, they found ?50,000 in
cash in a shoe box in the loft.

Adams was ordered last month to pay ?4.7m for legal costs over four years.

Hunt resumes for vanished Jewish library 
 
Rome, 6 giu (Velino) - A passionate quest for the Rome Synagogue library
stolen by German troops during World War, a story which could easily become
the script for an Indiana Jones blockbuster, might at last be on the right
path. And the 7,000 books, manuscripts and rare, centuries-old documents,
which formed the second most important Jewish library in the world after the
one in Jerusalem, could be lying somewhere in the immense territory of
Russia. Italian nvestigators acting on a mandate issued by a special Italian
Government committee that was created five years ago, have managed to follow
the steps of the stolen library up to a certain point. 
The library was loaded on trucks and then on trains on their way to Germany
on the night of October 14, 1943, by the Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg,
a special commando created in Third Reich with a precise task: to neutralise
Jewish culture and then destroy it. In order to do that, the Jewish culture
had to be studied in its details, so the library from Rome, like documents
from many other occupied countries in Europe, were to be transported to
Germany to be "analysed." It is known that thousands of books were shipped
to Frankfurt and other localities. Many of those were found and given back
to Jewish communities all over Europe. Together with those books, many were
found coming from another library, belonging to the Jewish Rabbinical
College in Rome, stolen the same night. But no trace was found of the
precious volumes from the Synagogue library. Many cases are known of rare
volumes of the same kind surfacing in this or that museum or private
collector around the world: but this did not happen for any of the books
stolen in Rome. 
Now Dario Tedeschi, a lawyer and director of the Italian Special committee,
has come to the conclusion that the 7,000 volumes were found by the Soviet
Army and taken back to Russia as a sort of war trophy, maybe without
realising what those books meant for the Jewish community. 
Now, with a donation of the Unicredit banking group, Mr Tedeschi and his
staff hope to be able to extend their search, hoping that the books have not
been dispersed, and they are still together in some underground depot in
some

Norman Rockwell's Russian Schoolroom.
 
The police report of the painting's 1973 theft

Subject(s): James Earl Ray, American Independent Party, Jack Solomon, House
Select Committee on Assassinations, Martin Luther King Jr., Creative Art
Studio, Norman Rockwell, Art Loss Register, FBI, Steven Spielberg In March
filmmaker Steven Spielberg was found in possession of a stolen Norman
Rockwell painting. As the Wall Street Journal, the Associated Press, CNN and
countless other media outlets reported then, Spielberg purchased the
pilfered art for $200,000 in 1989 - some sixteen years after it disappeared
from a suburban St. Louis gallery during an early-morning burglary. 

The artwork in question, an oil-on-canvas piece titled Russian Schoolroom,
was commissioned by Look magazine in 1967. Today it has a value of nearly
$700,000. According to federal authorities, Spielberg first learned of the
painting's dubious provenance in late February, when one of his employees
noticed the painting listed on the FBI's Art Crime Team Web site. In a press
release issued March 2, the FBI stated: "Mr. Spielberg is cooperating fully
with the FBI and will retain possession of the Russian Schoolroom until its
disposition can be determined." 

Now a civil legal battle has erupted over the ownership of the filched
painting. Last month Jack Solomon - owner of the now-defunct Clayton art
gallery, Arts International, from which the painting was stolen in 1973 -
sued both Spielberg and the FBI for ownership of the painting. 

The lawsuit filed in federal court in Solomon's home state of Nevada alleges
that the FBI "has allowed defendant Spielberg to retain possession of the
Rockwell painting and failed to return the subject artwork to plaintiff
Solomon despite the FBI's actual knowledge of the theft, recovery and
ownership." 

Meanwhile, Judy Goffman Cutler, the Rhode Island-based art dealer who sold
the painting to Spielberg in 1989, has filed suit against Solomon and the
Art Loss Register Inc., an agency that is assisting Solomon in retrieving
the painting. In a lawsuit also filed last month in federal court, Goffman
Cutler claims Solomon's insurer paid him $25,000 for the artwork following
the heist and that he no longer has any claim to the painting. 

Goffman Cutler further alleges that the Art Loss Register intimidated her by
threatening to have criminal charges filed against her and that Jack Solomon
defamed her character in an interview with Riverfront Times this spring. In
Kristen Hinman's article published March 7, Solomon claims Goffman Cutler
"should have known better" and "could have checked that there's been a
record of this ever since the day it was stolen." 

Goffman Cutler also asserts that Spielberg - an avid art collector and board
member for the Norman Rockwell Museum in Massachusetts - severed his
business relationship with her shortly after Solomon made his accusations to
the paper. She is asking the court to award her $5 million for the loss of
the Spielberg account and another $10 million for "general damage to her
reputation in her profession." 

On May 11 the movie mogul transferred title of Russian Schoolroom back to
Goffman Cutler in exchange for another Rockwell piece. Spielberg spokesman
Marvin Levy says the filmmaker is cooperating with officials and the FBI has
been kept abreast of every move. 

"Steven was prepared to turn it over to the FBI, but they asked us to hold
onto it for safekeeping," says Levy. "We're doing whatever they tell us." 

Solomon and his attorneys contend that Spielberg should never have signed
the title to the painting back over to Goffman Cutler. The maneuver, they
assert, does not clear the famed director of Schindler's List and other
Oscar-winning films of culpability. 

"It's very disappointing that Steven Spielberg - who is so active in
Holocaust causes and other philanthropies - chose in this case not to assist
a theft victim recover what's his," says Christopher Marinello, general
counsel for the Art Loss Register in New York. 

But even as new allegations over the ownership of the painting come to
light, parties on both sides of the debate are whispering of a far more
intriguing wrinkle to the story. They note that the government press
releases that heralded the painting's discovery last March make no mention
of the person (or persons) who stole Russian Schoolroom in the first place. 

The omission, say people familiar with the case, could be for good reason
and may very well be tied to the thief's association with a St. Louis-based
plot to kill Martin Luther King Jr. It's a wild story, full of FBI
oversights and fumbles - and a tale the feds might prefer remain a mystery. 

 

Mary Ellen Shortland was 28 years old and working as assistant director of
Arts International when someone smashed though the gallery's front door on
June 25, 1973. 

Shortland, now 62 and owner of Creative Art Gallery & Framing in south St.
Louis, recalls the theft of Russian Schoolroom as one of the great
disappointments in her young career. She says Arts International was hosting
an exhibit of signed Rockwell prints that June. In an effort to build
publicity for the three-week show, Jack Solomon (who owned Arts
International, as well as dozens of other galleries across the nation) had
an employee from one of his Kansas City studios drive Russian Schoolroom to
St. Louis. 

The painting had been here for just one day when on June 21 Shortland sold
it for $25,000 to the late Bert Elam, a St. Louis concrete contractor and
art collector. Elam agreed to let the gallery display the work until the end
of the show. Four days later, on June 25, a thief made off with the painting
and Shortland nearly lost her best customer. 

"Mr. Elam was very unhappy that I'd talked him into letting us keep the
painting," recalls Shortland. "Later he found out that the painting was
probably worth more like $40,000. He'd gotten a heck of a deal, only for it
to be robbed out from under him." 

In the end, the gallery reimbursed Elam the money he put down on the
painting and Arts International retained title to the work. Later the
gallery was paid $25,000 from its insurer for the loss. 

A few weeks after the theft, Elam hired a private detective to investigate.
Shortland recalls that the detective came back with disturbing news. "He
said he'd found the people who'd stolen it, and they were a bad outfit,"
remembers Shortland. "He warned Mr. Elam that even if he got the painting
back, they'd just steal it again." 

Shortland would eventually forget about the painting. Then - sixteen years
after its disappearance - she was flipping through the July/August 1989
edition of the trade magazine Art & Auction when she came across an
advertisement announcing the sale of Russian Schoolroom. 

"I did a complete double-take," she says. "That painting was stolen, and it
cost me a lot of money and headaches. I thought to myself: 'You got to be
kidding me.'" 

Shortland says she tried to call Jack Solomon at his Chicago offices but was
unable to get through. She then called Judy Goffman Fine Art in Manhattan,
which was listed in the magazine as the gallery selling the work. "I asked,
'Do you actually have the painting?'" recalls Shortland. "They said, 'Sure.'
They were asking something like $175,000 for it." 

Shortland's queries into the work were later chronicled by former Riverfront
Times reporter Wm. Stage in the October 11, 1989, issue of this paper. Stage
wrote that he also attempted to get in touch with Solomon to no avail. He
did, however, succeed in interviewing Judy Goffman Cutler, who told him
she'd recently sold the Rockwell to a person whom she declined to name. 

As to the claims that the painting had been stolen, Stage reported that
Goffman Cutler told him the artist often did several studies of one
painting. The stolen Rockwell, surmised Goffman Cutler, must have been a
different version of the one she'd recently sold. 

Stage later interviewed an agent with the FBI who spoke on the condition
that he not be quoted directly or named in the story. The agent told Stage
the FBI investigated the painting a year earlier, in 1988, when a Rockwell
scholar notified the agency that Russian Schoolroom was listed for sale at
an auction in New Orleans. (Goffman Cutler won the bidding at $70,400.) The
agent told Stage the matter was then routed to the FBI's St. Louis office,
but the investigation became stymied when no one could find a police report
for the stolen work. 

This past March Frank Brostrom, a special agent in charge of the FBI's Art
Crime Team, told Riverfront Times that he was prompted to reopen the case in
2004 when "a friendly source in the community" tipped him off to Stage's
1989 article. He, too, acknowledged that the police report was missing. 

"For whatever reason authorities at the time were unable to locate the
original police report or confirm the painting had ever been stolen,"
Brostrom told the RFT. 

Earlier this year agent Frank Brostrom was transferred from the FBI's St.
Louis office to North Carolina. He could not be reached for comment for this
story. Agents familiar with the Russian Schoolroom case in St. Louis and Los
Angeles would not comment on specifics other than what's already been
reported. 

If, however, the police report was missing back in 1989, it's now readily
available at the Clayton Police Department. "I got a call from the FBI about
two years ago on this and we were able to pull the report from our archives
right away," says Clayton police captain Kevin Murphy. "How or why that
wasn't the case then, I can't tell you." 

The six-page report gives the value of the painting as $20,000 and notes the
owner as both Arts International and Bert Elam. An appendix to the report
provides a witness testimony from a man who claimed to see a black male
break through the front door of the gallery at 6:40 a.m. and leave seconds
later with a painting tucked under his arm. Nothing else in the gallery was
touched during the smash-and-run. 

Clayton police can produce several more larceny reports from the same
address at 8113 Maryland Avenue. During a stretch in the mid-1970s the
gallery was a constant target, with a persistent thief (or thieves)
burglarizing the gallery on at least four separate occasions between 1973
and 1977. 

The most interesting of those break-ins occurred July 8, 1976, when a crook
pried open the front door to the gallery and left with seven Rockwell
lithograph prints valued at more than $7,000. 

In late February 1978 those prints would be recovered in the Rock Hill home
of Russell G. Byers. A notorious St. Louis art thief, Byers would testify
before the House Select Committee on Assassinations in May 1978 that he'd
once been offered $50,000 by two Jefferson County businessmen to kill Martin
Luther King Jr. 

Byers declined the offer, but the House committee found enough
circumstantial evidence to believe James Earl Ray may have been motivated by
the very same bounty when he gunned down King in Memphis on April 4, 1968. 

 

Several inches of snow lay on the ground the night of Sunday, January 29,
1978, when an old Chevrolet Impala pulled up in front of the Saint Louis Art
Museum. Three men in ski masks emerged from the vehicle. One of them carried
a sledgehammer. 

In plain sight of people sledding on Art Hill, the men smashed a window and
disappeared into the building. Two minutes later at 10:39 p.m., the men
exited the museum, taking with them four statues valued at nearly $100,000 -
including Frederic Remington's The Bronco Buster, valued at nearly $40,000. 

Three weeks later - on Monday, February 20 - thieves once again broke into
the museum. This time they smashed through the glass door to the museum's
east wing at approximately 8:24 p.m. The burglars went up the east stairway
and made off with three bronze sculptures by famed French sculptor Auguste
Rodin, best known for his iconic piece The Thinker. By the time the museum
guards arrived minutes later, the thieves and the Rodin sculptures - valued
at $45,000 - were nowhere to be found. 

Eight days after the second museum heist, St. Louis detectives picked up
John A. Crenshaw on federal charges of robbing a jewelry store in Illinois.
They were interrogating the 25-year-old suspect at police headquarters when
Crenshaw shocked police by implicating himself in the museum break-ins. 

Crenshaw told the detectives that Russell Byers had taken him to the museum
prior to the January 29 robbery and shown him which statues he wanted him to
steal. He said Byers paid him and his accomplices $700 for the first museum
burglary. Crenshaw burglarized the museum a second time because the first
theft had been "so easy." Shortly after both robberies Crenshaw allegedly
handed over the stolen art to Byers in a street exchange in the 5500 block
of Cabanne Avenue in north city. 

Crenshaw suggested that at least six of the seven stolen statues could be
found with Byers. The seventh statue, a wood carving of St. Sebastian
appraised at $4,500, was hidden away in Crenshaw's garage in north St.
Louis. At 11 a.m. some 20 law enforcement officials - including the FBI -
descended on Byers' home in Rock Hill. They carried with them a search
warrant. When Byers' wife refused them entry, they broke through a door pane
and entered the home. 

The statues weren't there, but police found plenty of other loot. As Byers'
wife and two teenage children stood outside on the lawn, police removed an
estimated $300,000 worth of stolen artwork - including two paintings signed
by Rembrandt, six oriental rugs, more than 100 silver candelabras, jade
dishes and the seven Norman Rockwell lithographs stolen from Arts
International in the 1976 burglary. 

It would take another several weeks before the police recovered the six
missing statues from the museum. Remington's The Bronco Buster turned up in
a Goodwill drop box on Forest Park Avenue. Two other statues were found at a
hotel on Oakland Avenue. Other statues were found in the back lot of a metal
company on Manchester Road. 

A few hours after police stormed his home, Byers turned himself into city
police. The 46-year-old Byers gave his occupation as a vending-machine
dealer. He was released on a $5,000 bond. At the time the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch reported Byers had been arrested in St. Louis City and St.
Louis County on several occasions in the 1960s. 

In 1965 he had been convicted in U.S. District Court in St. Louis of
conspiracy to commit auto theft and was placed on probation. Records show
Byers faced two criminal charges in St. Louis County in the 1970s. Both
cases remain sealed. 

In the weeks and months following the first museum burglary in 1978, two of
Byers' and Crenshaw's associates met violent deaths. Twenty-nine-year-old
Charles Gunn, who assisted Crenshaw in the first break-in, was found shot in
the head February 17 in a north St. Louis alley. On June 11 police
discovered the disfigured body of 42-year-old Sam White in a field in
Madison County, Illinois. Described by police as "Byers' right-hand man"
White had been shot three times and his body so badly burned it took several
days to identify him. 

After initially implicating Byers in the museum thefts, Crenshaw refused to
testify against him in court. Crenshaw was sentenced to four years in
prison. Byers got off scot-free. 

In July 1978 St. Louis Circuit Attorney George Peach told the Post-Dispatch
that without Crenshaw's testimony, the case against Byers was "too weak" to
pursue. In St. Louis County, the prosecutor's office gave the newspaper a
similar account. They would not file charges against Byers for possessing
the Rockwell lithographs stolen from Arts International. 

It wasn't just local prosecutors who were dropping charges against Byers. On
May 9, 1978, the U.S. House of Representatives granted Byers immunity under
the Organized Crime Control Act for any possible prosecution involving his
association with a St. Louis-based plot to assassinate Martin Luther King. 

Today, those entangled in the legal battle with Steven Spielberg wonder if
Byers didn't cut a similar deal to avoid prosecution in the disappearance of
Russian Schoolroom. They say given Byers' taste for illicit art, it's likely
he's the person who contracted the painting's heist in 1973. 

Byers' involvement might also explain why no one has been charged with the
theft - and why the FBI failed to close in on the painting in 1988 and 1989
when its agents claim the police report went missing. 

Sound far-fetched? Perhaps, but Byers himself does not entirely rule it out.


 

Russell Byers' modest brick home sits at the end of a cul-de-sac in the
quiet suburb of Rock Hill. It's the same house police raided back in 1978. A
picture window with a blue awning faces out into the front lawn. Two yapping
Yorkshire terriers announce the arrival of anyone who steps near the
property. 

On a recent weekday afternoon the silhouette of a man appears behind a
screened door. Before I can even reach the driveway, the man calls out: "Who
are you? What do you want?" 

I explain that I'm looking for Russell Byers. I want to talk to him about
some art thefts back in the 1970s. The man responds that Byers is not home,
and even if he were, why would he want to talk? "What's in it for him?" 

I'm curious if he knows anything about a famous Norman Rockwell painting
stolen in 1973. The painting, I explain, is now in the possession of
filmmaker Steven Spielberg. 

"It's a hell of a story, isn't it?" the man responds. "Maybe there's a lot
more to it than you know." After a few minutes the man steps outside and
walks over to where I'm standing in the driveway. A wrought-iron fence
separates us. 

At 76 years old, Byers no longer appears like the underworld thug newspaper
articles once made him out to be. In fact, he looks downright grandfatherly.
His white hair is parted neatly down the side. He wears slip-on loafers with
blue socks, a pair of stone-colored khakis and a short-sleeve Oxford cloth
shirt. A silver Rolex dangles from his left arm. 

Byers' cheeks are a ruddy pink. He blinks his blue eyes constantly - the
result, he says, of surgery to relieve a problem with his tear ducts. "Don't
think I'm retarded," he says of the blinking. "I still have all my marbles."


Byers then returns to the matter at hand: his possible connection to stolen
Rockwell painting. "Why would I want to tell you anything about that? Why
would I want the aggravation and the humiliation?" 

I tell him that the statute of limitations for the theft has long since
expired. I ask him if anyone else has contacted him about Russian
Schoolroom. The FBI, he confirms, has asked him about the painting. Any more
information, says Byers, will cost me. He wants money to talk. 

I tell him that it's against the policy of the RFT to pay sources, adding
that I doubted the New York Times paid him when it interviewed him for a
front-page story on July 26, 1978, which revealed for the first time Byers'
role in a St. Louis plot to assassinate King. 

"I was in Newsweek and Time magazine, too," boasts Byers. "But none of them
got the whole story." 

The article published in the New York Times in 1978 described Byers'
testimony before the House committee as an "embarrassment" to the FBI.
According to the Times article - and backed by congressional reports - an
informant first told the FBI in 1973 that Byers knew of a conspiracy hatched
in St. Louis in the 1960s to kill the civil rights leader. But the FBI
misfiled the information and it did not come to light until 1978 - long
after several of the key players in the scheme were dead and gone. 

When contacted by the House committee in 1978, Byers first denied any
knowledge that he'd been offered money to kill King. Later he agreed to
testify in exchange for immunity. Byers, according to congressional reports,
told the committee that he was approached in late 1966 or '67 by John
Kauffmann, a former St. Louis stockbroker and owner of a motel and drug
company in Imperial. 

The two men had a business relationship of sorts, with Kauffmann accepting
payment from Byers in exchange for allowing him to squirrel away stolen
merchandise at Kauffmann's Jefferson County motel. Byers told the committee
that in '66 or '67 Kauffmann asked him if he would like to make $50,000. 

The following comes directly from the committee report: "Kauffmann told him
to meet him at 6:30 that evening, which Byers did, and together they drove
to the home in Imperial of John Sutherland, a St. Louis patent attorney. The
three men met in a study that Byers described as decorated with Confederate
flags and Civil War memorabilia. There was a rug replica of a Confederate
flag as well, and Sutherland was wearing what appeared to Byers to be a
Confederate colonel's hat. 

"After some social conversation, Byers asked Sutherland what he would have
to do for the $50,000. Sutherland said he would have to kill, or arrange to
have killed, Dr. Martin Luther King. Byers, who told the committee he did
not know at the time who Dr. King was, asked where that amount of money
would come from. 

"Sutherland told him he belonged to a secret southern organization that had
plenty of money. According to Byers, no names were mentioned. Byers said he
neither accepted nor rejected the offer, indicating he would think it over.
Outside the door of Sutherland's home, however, he told Kauffmann he was not
interested." 

Based on Byers' testimony, the House committee launched what it described as
a "full-scale investigation" of Byers, Kauffmann and Sutherland. The
committee discovered that Byers had told two St. Louis attorneys the same
story in 1968 and again in 1974. Both attorneys corroborated Byers' story
under questioning. 

Further, an unpaid informant for the Jefferson County sheriff's office in
the 1960s testified to hearing the same "standing offer to murder Dr. King"
among guests who frequented Kauffmann's Buff Acres motel, which at the time
was a known haven for prostitutes, drug dealers and petty criminals. 

Kauffmann died in April 1974. John Sutherland had passed away four years
earlier. But in 1968 both men were active in the American Independent Party,
which backed segregationist Alabama governor George Wallace for president.
Also heavily involved in local efforts to elect Wallace was James Earl Ray's
brother, John Larry Ray. 

The House committee described John Ray's now-shuttered Grapevine Tavern
across from Benton Park in south St. Louis as a "distribution point for
American Party campaign literature." John Ray was even known to drive voters
to the election office to register with the party. 

Also active in the American Independent Party was James Earl Ray, who was
serving a twenty-year sentence for armed robbery when he broke out of the
Missouri State Penitentiary in Jefferson City in April 1967. While on the
lam, Ray worked briefly for the Wallace campaign in California. 

The committee believed Ray's brothers, John and Jerry Ray, assisted him
during his flight from justice. And while the congressional investigators
could find no "direct link" between the principals of the St. Louis
conspiracy and King's killer, they believed there was a likelihood that word
of the standing offer on Dr. King's life reached James Earl prior to the
assassination. 

"James Earl Ray may simply have been aware of the offer and acted with a
general expectation of payment after the assassination," the House committee
reported. "Or he may have acted, not only with an awareness of the offer,
but also after reaching a specific agreement, either directly or through one
or both brothers, with Kauffmann or Sutherland." 

The committee concluded its investigation into Byers' claims of a St. Louis
conspiracy by opining: "It is unfortunate that this information was not
developed in 1968, when it could have been pursued by law enforcement
agencies. It is a matter on which reasonable people may legitimately differ,
but the committee believes that the conspiracy that eventuated in Dr. King's
death in 1968 could have been brought to justice in 1968." 

Today Byers shies away from discussing what he told the congressional
committee in 1978. He says journalists and conspiracy theorists still knock
on his door, trying to get him to share his story. None, apparently, have
forked over enough cash to hear his tale. 

Byers, meanwhile, says he remains confused by the testimony of at least one
individual from the congressional hearings. Murray Randall was one of the
St. Louis lawyers who testified to hearing Byers discuss the offer to
assassinate King in 1968 and again in 1974. Later Randall went on to become
a judge in St. Louis. 

"The judge told the FBI that I was the most notoriously dangerous criminal
in St. Louis," says Byers. "I don't know where that came from. We were
friends." 

Byers says he never cut a deal with the feds to avoid prosecution for the
Saint Louis Art Museum burglaries in 1978 and takes issue with allegations
that he killed or arranged for the murder of accomplices Charlie Gunn and
Sam White. "I didn't have anything to do with it," says Byers. "Black guys
were always killing each other back then. What can I say? 

"Don't make me out to be a bad guy," Byers tells me. "The media always makes
me out to be a bad guy. I'm no murderer. I've never killed anyone." 

I'm not saying you killed anyone, I tell him. I simply want to discuss what
- if anything - he knows about the Russian Schoolroom painting. When he
again brings up the subject of money, I suggest I might have the wrong
person - that someone else probably stole the painting. 

As I walk down the driveway to my car, Byers coyly responds, "You know,
you're right. I'm sure art thieves all over the world were targeting that
little gallery in Clayton. Come back later," he adds, "when you have your
pocketbook."

Bedard's boyfriend found guilty of art theft 

Updated Wed. Jun. 6 2007 7:40 AM ET

Canadian Press

MONTREAL -- A jury has found the boyfriend of Olympic champion Myriam Bedard
guilty of art theft. 


But the conviction will be appealed. 


Nima Mazhari was convicted of stealing 20 paintings from the late Ghitta
Caiserman-Roth between 2001 and 2003. 


He was also found guilty of possession of stolen goods worth a total of
100-thousand dollars. 


The robbery came to light when Caiserman-Roth's daughter received a letter
from Bedard's estranged father in 2004 accusing Mazhari of the theft. 


Bedard, who has been by Mazhari's side all through the court proceedings,
was not with him when the verdict was announced. 


Bedard herself is due in a Quebec City court this month to set a date for a
trial on child abduction charges. 


She was accused of taking her 11-year-old daughter to Washington D.C, in
violation of a custody agreement with the girl's father.

Global warming, war, development threaten historic sites

More  By Tim McLaughlin

NEW YORK, June 6 (Reuters) - Bombs in Iraq, better commutes in Ireland and
melting ice caps are threatening the world's architectural and cultural
gems, a nonprofit group said on Wednesday as it named 100 endangered
monuments.

The World Monuments Fund's list for 2008 for the first time included climate
change as a hazard for some of the world's great historic sites.

Surging development and commercialism, along with political conflict, also
pose risk to sites such as the Church of the Holy Nativity in Bethlehem.

"On this list, man is indeed the real enemy," said Bonnie Burnham, president
of the fund. "But just as we have caused the damage in the first place, we
have the power to repair it."

The group said Peru's Machu Picchu is threatened by unchecked tourism and
St. Petersburg's skyline will be changed forever if Gazprom's planned
skyscraper is built for the state-controlled gas export monopoly.

Tara Hill in Ireland, considered a sacred landscape, is now threatened by
the development of a highway meant to ease the commute from Dublin. Canada's
Herschel Island, situated on the edge of the Yukon and home to ancient Inuit
sites, could be washed away in melting permafrost, the group said.

Meanwhile, the war in Iraq has put that country's entire cultural heritage
at grave risk, the nonprofit group said.

"The archeological sites of Iraq are being looted at an alarming rate and
the loss is catastrophic," said Michelle Berenfeld, program manager at the
fund. "Unlike objects in museums -- for which there is at least some record
of their existence and in most cases where they came from -- objects that
are stolen out of the ground are completely lost, forever.

"In Iraq, where much of these archeological sites date to the earliest
civilizations on the planet, the physical remains of those cultures are the
main sources of information we have about them, so stealing them is like
tearing out the pages of a history book that can never be rewritten,"
Berenfeld said.

Since 1996, the fund has made more than 500 grants totaling more than $47
million to sites in 74 countries.

While Burnham said the fund cannot be a policeman, it can raise public
awareness, which has acted as leverage for funding from other sources. The
group said its funds have drawn more than $124 million from other sources.

The New York-based group said more than 75 percent of endangered sites on
previous lists had been rescued or were well on the way to being preserved.

The complete 2008 list can be viewed at www.worldmonumentswatch.org.
