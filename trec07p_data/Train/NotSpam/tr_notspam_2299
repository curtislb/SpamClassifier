pin_gween writes "The Washington Post reports on the [0]probable abuse of
the National Student Loan Data System. The database was created in 1993
to help determine which students are eligible for financial aid.
Students' Social Security numbers, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, birth
dates, and loan balances are in the database. It contains 60 million
student records and is covered by federal privacy laws. Advocates worry
that businesses are trolling for marketing data they can use to bombard
students with mass mailings or other solicitations. The department has
spent over $650,000 in the past four years protecting the data. However,
some senior education officials are advocating a temporary shutdown of
access to the database until tighter security measures can be put in
place."

The possibility that [0]one cause of high blood pressure lies within the
brain, and not the heart or blood vessels, has been put forward by
scientists at the University of Bristol, UK. A research group there found
a novel role for a protein called JAM-1, located in the walls of blood
vessels in the brain. JAM-1 traps white blood cells, which can then cause
inflammation and may obstruct blood flow, resulting in poor oxygen supply
to the brain. The article notes that the idea that hypertension is an
inflammatory vascular disease of the brain is somewhat controversial.

conventional oscillator circuits are nonlinear systems in which increases

applications.' The article also talks about the surprising applications
this new technology may evolve into."

[0]andrew cooke writes "[1]Java 6 was recently released, but many
programmers are still exploring the features introduced in Java 5 —
probably the most significant changes in the language's twelve year
history. Amongst those changes (enumerations, auto-boxing, foreach,
varargs) generics was the most far-reaching, introducing generic
programming in a simpler, safer way than C++ templates and, unlike
generics in C#, maintaining backwards (and forwards) compatibility with
existing Java code." Read on for the rest of Andrew's review.

ScienceDaily is reporting that a new vaccine used in the treatment of a
cancer found primarliy in the brain is [0]showing promising results after
an initial trial at the University of California. "Of the 12 patients
being treated, eight can currently be evaluated for overall survival,
while four are still receiving treatment. Seven out of the eight patients
have exceeded the historical median benchmark of 6.5 months survival from
time of recurrence. The investigators will continue to follow the
patients for overall survival. Based on these results, a larger,
multi-center phase 2 study is planned for late 2007."

An anonymous reader writes "The Canadian government is reportedly ready
to introduce copyright reform legislation this spring, provided that no
election is called. The new bill would move Canada far [0]closer to the
U.S. on copyright, with DMCA-style anti-circumvention legislation that
prohibits circumvention of DRM systems and bans software and mod chips
that can be used to circumvent such systems."

[0]Craig Sender writes to tell us that PC World has compiled a list of
the [1]20 most annoying tech products of all time. Topping the list was
AOL's ubiquitous free trial CD's. "This list hardly covers every annoying
tech product ever made. But where did this list of 20 come from? [PC
World Readers] picked the worst ones by voting in our Annoyances Poll,
and you'll see your Top 10 most annoying products flagged with icons.
Just for fun, we've added 10 more products that didn't get enough votes
from you in our poll but that we found particularly irksome."

An anonymous reader writes "Within a few weeks, Australia may
[0]introduce new laws to censor films and literature deemed by the
government to be supportive of terrorism. This is not the first time
material has been censored in Australia, which has previously [1]censored
films and banned publications, including one titled [2]Defence of the
Muslim Lands (censored in mid 2006 by Attorney-General Phillip Ruddock).
The proposed laws are aimed to target material such as a DVD by [3]Feiz
Mohammad containing some of his past controversial sermons calling for
jihad and comparing Jews with pigs. The Office of Film and Literature
Classification previously classified this DVD as 'PG', suitable for
viewing by anyone under 15 years of age with parental guidance."

[0]Steve Kerrison writes "From the Intel Developer Forum in Beijing comes
news of the successor to the Napa notebook platform. [1]Santa Rosa, which
will head up Intel's notebook technology line-up until 2H 2008, beefs up
almost everything seen in Napa, from graphics to WiFi. 'Santa Rosa
carries Robson Technology, now known as Intel Turbo Memory, the
flash-based disc-caching system that speeds up loading times of
frequently-used data. Santa Rosa is an obvious continuation of the
Centrino series. There will also be another Santa Rosa Centrino variant —
Pro — that covers the business features found on Intel's Q-series
chipsets, namely vPro.' Intel's Core2 mobile processors remain a key part
of the platform, as you'd expect, with 45nm 'Penryn' CPUs making their
way into the Santa Rosa refresh in 2008."

Firefox. Slovenia (44.5%), Finland (41.3%), Croatia (36.5%), and Germany
(36.2%) lead the way, followed by a group of mostly Eastern European

Andorra. Oceania maintains a slight lead over Europe, at 24.8%; the rest
