Sadly, we haven't yet heard from Kirk on this issue. As I've tried to
tell him for years, this is a problem that needs solving by Speakup.
Speakup simply needs to deactivate itself in the gui environment. No
other solution is rational. It is unacceptable to have to kill Speakup
by hand, and it seems that doesn't even work for some. Surely, we
shoulden't have to choose between Speakup and Orca?
