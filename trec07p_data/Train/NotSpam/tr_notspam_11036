I use rxvt, so I'd use this:
rxvt -fn 10x20

Back when I was using Eterm, I think I did this:
Eterm -F 10x20

Fluxbox is based on blackbox, and blackbox menu file is in 
~/.blackbox/menu, so you might have to edit ~/.fluxbox/menu. I don't 
know of a menu editing utility for blackbox/fluxbox; just edit the text 
menu file.

I don't know anything about the icons.

For setting fonts in terminal emulators, read the associated manual 
pages and the documentation in /usr/share/doc/<program>. You can get a 
list of fonts that should work properly by typing "xlsfonts | less".

You probably don't need to modify the menu to get mrxvt to change its 
look. If it's anything like rxvt, you can use X resources to configure it:

<FILE name="~/.Xdefaults">
mrxvt*font:10x20
</FILE>

Execute this before starting mrxvt:
xrdb -merge ~/.Xdefaults


I hope this helps.
