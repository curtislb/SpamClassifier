6:59 PM, 6/17/07, Update: Spacewalk ends; all major objectives accomplished=
=20

Astronauts Pat Forrester and Steve Swanson wrapped up a six-hour 29-minute =
spacewalk today, completing the critical activation of a solar array rotati=
on system and a variety of space station assembly get-ahead tasks.

"It's time for you to come on in," astronaut Jim Reilly radioed from Atlant=
is' flight deck.

"I'll take one last look and if I could, just say happy Father's Day," Forr=
ester replied. "It's been a great way to spend it. I want to say happy Fath=
er's Day to my Dad, my father-in-law and for being a father to my two sons.=
 So thanks."

"I'd like to echo the same words," Swanson called. "Thanks for reminding me=
."

"Absolutely," Reilly said, "a lot of fathers on this flight and we're all e=
njoying a great Father's Day."

The excursion began at 12:25 p.m. and ended with the start of airlock repre=
ssurization at 6:54 p.m. This was the fourth and final spacewalk for the At=
lantis astronauts, pushing the crew's total to 27 hours and 58 minutes. For=
rester and Swanson logged a total of 13 hours and 45 minutes for the second=
 and fourth EVAs while Reilly and Danny Olivas put in 14 hours and 13 minut=
es during the first and third outings.

Overall, this was the 87th spacewalk devoted to space station assembly and =
maintenance since construction began in 1998. With today 's EVA, 48 U.S. as=
tronauts, 15 Russian cosmonauts, two Canadians and four astronauts represen=
ting Japan, Germany, France and Sweden have logged 537 hours and three minu=
tes of EVA time building and maintaining the space station.

The primary goal of today's spacewalk was an inspection of the drive motors=
 on the starboard solar alpha rotary joint - SARJ - on the right side of th=
e station's main solar power truss; removal of a final few launch locks to =
permit free rotation; stowage of a keel pin used to anchor the S3/24 truss =
element in the shuttle's cargo bay during launch; and installation of a saf=
ety stop on the end of the track used by the station's robot arm-carrying m=
obile transporter.

The spacewalkers also ran a computer cable that eventually will permit astr=
onauts in the U.S. segment of the station to command systems in the Russian=
 segment. They opened a newly installed hydrogen valve that is part of a ne=
w U.S. oxygen generation system and attempted to bolt down a micrometeoroid=
 debris shield that could not be put back in place during an earlier spacew=
alk. Swanson and Forrester were not able to get it anchored, either, so the=
y used tethers to lash it down.
