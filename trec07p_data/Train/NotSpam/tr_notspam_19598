WIPO | Thiru, from Geneva | WIPO Development Agenda
PCDA Recommendations to WIPO General Assembly (not finalized yet)
June 15th, 2007 by Thiru Balasubramaniam

It is 7:40PM and the plenary has still not resumed on the final day of
WIPO negotiations on Development Agenda. The final PCDA recommendations
to the General Assembly are still being negotiated in the green room.
Of the text reproduced here, the first six paragraphs have been agreed
upon according to informed sources. The 7th paragraph is still under
discussion. One would hope paragraph 4 of these PCDA recommendations
would not preclude the ad hoc accreditation of intergovernmental
organizations and non governmental organizations.

PCDA Recommendations to General Assembly

     The PCDA decided to make the following recommendations to the 2007
General Assembly:

     1. The proposals contained in the Annex are agreed upon and hence
recommended for adoption.

     2. A list of proposals for immediate implementation will be
submitted by the Chair of the PCDA to the 2007 General Assembly.

     3. A Committee on IP and Development be established immediately to:

     a. develop an implementation plan for the remaining agreed
proposals for a development agenda;
     b. monitor, assess and report on the implementation of the agreed
plan in cooperation with other relevant WIPO bodies;
     c. discuss IP and development related issues as agreed by the
Committee, as well as those decided by the General Assembly.

     4. The Committee will be composed of the Member States of WIPO and
open to the participation of all accredited intergovernmental and non
governmental-organizations. It will consider and adopt rules of
procedure based on the WIPO General Rules of Procedure at its first
meeting which will be convened in the first half of 2008. The number
and duration of meetings are to be decided by the General Assembly.

     5. For the first meeting of the Committee, the present Chair of the
PCDA is requested to prepare a draft implementation plan in
consultation with Member States and the Secretariat. The draft plan
should include information on the financial and human resources
implications to be included in WIPO’s budgetary planning process.

     6. The Committee will report and may make recommendations annually
to the Generally Assembly.

     7. The PCIPD shall cease to exist and the mandate of the PCDA will
not be renewed.
