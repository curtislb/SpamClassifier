Hi,

I just realized that the listserv deleted the attachment. Therefore here

Dear Chancellor Merkel,

In Médecins Sans Frontières programmes around the world, HIV/Aids and
tuberculosis
present us with an enormous challenge, which we would like to bring to
your attention.
We believe tuberculosis illustrates the complex relationship between
innovation, medical
needs and access to healthcare. Our patients with TB are dying: we cannot
reliably
diagnose them in half of the cases; the deadly, all too common of
combination of HIV
and TB is hard to treat. More and more often, patients come to us with
multi-drug
resistant or extensively drug resistant strains, which renders treatment
with existing drugs
so difficult that it is almost impossible.
The constraints we are faced with are due to the inadequacy of the medical
tools that we
are forced to rely on as doctors. We are diagnosing patients by
microscopy, a method
invented by Robert Koch in 1882. Our major weapons against the disease are
drugs that
were developed more than 40 years ago.
Innovation is desperately needed for tuberculosis: we will simply not be
able to stem the
tide of the disease with current tools. Germany’s performance is
particularly
disappointing: within the little investment that exists for tuberculosis
today, Germany
ranks a lowly 13th. TB is one example – there are many other diseases that
primarily
affect people in poor countries for which there is today insufficient
investment into
research and development.
Chancellor Merkel, you have made innovation one of the top agenda points
for this G8.
And yet the only strategy you offer to foster innovation is the protection
of intellectual
property.
Under certain conditions intellectual property may have an important role
to play.
However it is widely recognized and well documented, including by WHO,
that
protection of intellectual property does nothing to stimulate innovation
for diseases –
when there is no market, patent protection is not enough to attract
pharmaceutical
companies’ investment. Innovation does not take place, and patients, like
those MSF
sees with tuberculosis today, are left without the diagnostic tools or
drugs that work.
Innovation is meaningless in health if the people who need access to the
products are
excluded. Yet your innovation agenda ignores the needs of people in poor
countries,
while Africa is a key focus of the G8.
Where there is no market, new approaches for innovation that are not based
on paying for
the innovation through high drug prices and patents are needed. Such new
proposals for
new mechanisms to stimulate health innovation exist and these will be
considered at the
WHO Intergovernmental working group on public health, innovation and
intellectual
property (IGWG). This process offers an historic opportunity to change the
current
situation: the G8 should put its force behind this.
We also note that the G8 will discuss counterfeit medicines. Counterfeit
medicines are a
danger to people’s health. But it is necessary to deal with the issue in
its entirety: the
lack of effective quality medicines that people can afford fuels the
counterfeit problem.
This is the issue that the G8 must address.
The recent patent disputes in Thailand, Brazil and India show that the G8
cannot state
that IP is the backbone of innovation without recognizing the enormous
problems patents
on pharmaceuticals cause for ensuring that people have access to these
innovations.
The rising prices of patented AIDS medicines are a huge concern. MSF
treats more than
80,000 patients with HIV in more than 30 countries. We are facing a cost
explosion,
possibly already a doubling of drug expenses within two years, as more and
more patients
need to change to second-line treatment. Other programmes will soon face
the same
challenge. We imagine this is the same for many countries.
The G8 must affirm the right of countries to use TRIPS flexibilities such
as compulsory
licenses and support initiatives for a pro-health management of IP, such
as a patent pool,
to ensure that patents are not a barrier to access to life-saving
medicines.
Finally, it is important for the G8 to ensure that adequate funding for
health is available,
such as through the Global Fund. However extra resources should not
devoted to
subsidising premium-priced health care products. Funding for health can
have a far
greater impact if the cost of medicines can be brought down.
