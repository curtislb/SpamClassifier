Like Chuck said, use .profile; that's what I do.  Not sure about
.bashrc; I've heard of it but never make use of it.  About those other
aliases that keep comming back, look in your /etc directory.  Read
through /etc/profile for starters and notice the reference to
/etc/profile.d and all the .sh files inside.  Aliases can be, and are
set in one or more of those scripts.  I think most of them pertain to
the ls command and other environment variables are set in there too.
Another brief educational experience awaits you when browsing the /etc
directory.:)
