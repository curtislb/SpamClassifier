We'd like this to work, but it's very much secondary to having everything
working well within one network.

Certainly Jabber supports communication between people on different servers.
Getting it to work well on the OLPC would probably require some specific
support for it in Sugar. Also, some activities currently assume that anybody
you talk to has a routable IP address, which it not necessarily the case on
the Internet unless you have IPv6.
