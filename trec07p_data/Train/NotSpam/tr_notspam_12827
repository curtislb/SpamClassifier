If the file has read access, then it can always be copied and attached, unless 
you are prohibited from distributing the file in public domain.

The cheapest way (if possible) is to use an editor that supports block 
selection (like, kate, emacs) then block select the 3 columns from the second 
file and paste them beside the last column in the first one. Done.

Now, if the merging has to be done in R, one way is to read.table the first 
file with 'skip=13' that way you will get only the data. Then read.table from 
the second file and cbind the two data.frames. Finally write.table into a new 
file. By this the data will merged but to add the comments, I think you will 
have to do it manually, copy from the first file and paste into the new file, 
using whatever text editor you use. (I assume the file is a text file)
