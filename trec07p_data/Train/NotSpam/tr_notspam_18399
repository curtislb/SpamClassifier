There are two methods of doing a "safe" insertion that I'm familiar  
with under the DBI module.
I've never had a problem with either of these.  But I've had many  
problems when I don't use these.

Option one:

use the prepare statement

my $sql = "insert into table(name, address, state) values (?,?,?)";
my $sth = $dbh->prepare($sql);

...

$sth->execute($name,$address, $state);

This will automatically do proper escaping of the strings you want to  
insert.

Option Two:

If for some reason it's not practical or possible to use the prepare  
statement then you can use the DBI quote().  However, this is  
generally rare.

my $sql = "insert into table(name) values (" . $dbh->quote($name) . ")";
$dbh->do($sql);

But option one is going to be your best bet.
