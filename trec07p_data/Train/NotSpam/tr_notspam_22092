     Yep.  I even have the floppy images from debian.org.  I'm trying to 
get away from package managers, and doing things like gentoo (sp?). 
Scratch installations from post-compiled source.  I'm just not ready to 
give up on some package management support yet.  I've always planned on 
porting to Slackware.  Going blind sorta pushed me into the comversion 
before I anticipated it, since Slack has some pretty good SpeakUp support.
