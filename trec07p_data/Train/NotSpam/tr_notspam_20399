Subject: TTSynth Is Available Again


> Dear Friends:
>
> Shortly after we launched TTSynth a few weeks ago, we discovered that
> certain users were having problems downloading our software. We closed
> our doors tempporarily as a result, and spent the last week debugging
> these problems. We believe we have them well solved. Consequently, it is
> once again possible to purchase and download TTSynth.
>
> http://TTSynth.Com
>
> Of course we also provided packages through email to those few customers
> who experienced problems with our initial release. We believe there are
> now no outstanding issues.
>
> Specifically, we had two problems to fix in our automated download 
> process:
>
> 1.) Customers using Internet Explorer on Microsoft Windows were
> unable to complete transactions. This is now fixed.
>
> 2.) Some customers using Debian or Ubuntu experienced failures due
> to a bug we uncovered in the earlier version of GNU TLS used on these
> two distributions. Of course it is very important that your Internet
> transaction is properly protected by SSL. This is now also fixed.
>
> Consequently, the premier Text To Speech (TTS) software synthesizer for
> Linux is once again available for immediate secure on line purchase and
> download using a credit card!

>
> Available Languages For Linux

>   The best is also very affordable. Your first language license is only 
> $40 USD
> and each additional language license is only $20 USD, when obtained at the
> same time.
