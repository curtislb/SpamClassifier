FWIW, I have a dual processor G5 Mac (not dual core... 2 separate, 2GHz
processors-- not even made anymore, so you might find a deal if trying to
save $$. If not, go for the octo-core Mac Pro--- 2 quad cores in one very
expensive box).

On my system I have found that with 5G RAM installed, I can either
1) launch an R64 session that is truly 64 bit R environment, and address
very large objects in RAM, or
2) do what has been described here and launch 2 sessions (in the command
line, or batch sessions, or 1 GUI and 1 CLI session) and get nearly full
speed out of both... a glance at the system activity  monitor shows both
processors pegged when I do this.

But if I use one regular R session, I still have a very responsive system
for other tasks. Good opportunity to use GnuCash to pay my bills....

I've never tried launching more than 2 sessions, since I only have the 2
cpus...
