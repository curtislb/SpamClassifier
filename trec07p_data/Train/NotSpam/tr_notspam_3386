Oops.  My bad.  It was definitely supposed to.  The text was:

"(There is a special exception for the license texts and similar legal 
documents associated with works in Debian;"

I guess "associated with" is too vague.

How about:
"There is a special exception for the texts of the licenses under which 
works in Debian are distributed;"

?

(Incidentally, given the number of important wordsmithing comments 
people have made, please nobody actually propose a GR until it's been 
through the peer-editing wringer.)
