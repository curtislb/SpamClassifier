I decided to back up a bit and try a more simple routine. I have the 
array @id_hits populated and I can search the log for the line and print 
it. The problem is it only finds the first match and that is it.

foreach my $prime_id ( @id_hits ) {
     while ( my $line = <$AFILE> ) {
         if ( $line =~ /$prime_id/ ) {
             print "$line\n";
             next;
         }
     }
}

Do I need to pass it back to the foreach somehow?

Robert
