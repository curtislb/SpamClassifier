Yep, I don't believe that it is possible to do reliable idle events  
with a timed event.

How can you distinguish between an event that represents real work and  
an event that represents internal housekeeping?

This seems like something that's generically useful. The hardest part  
aboout idle events is when the definition of idle depends on another  
subsystem. for example, it's quite easy for an LDAP subsystem to track  
the last time it was called and idle out that way. For exit on idle,  
however, the idle event needs to be able to introspect other events  
and figure out the last time they were idle.
