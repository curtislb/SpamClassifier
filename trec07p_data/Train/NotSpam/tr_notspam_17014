Hiya,
    Are their any Debian-specific patches I need to apply to the kernel?  I 
seem to remember that their was a package named 'debian-patches', or the 
like.  Just want to be sure to cover all the bases, though this description 
seems to be enough for me to follow.  I'd also need to add speakup patches, 
of course...
Thanks,
Zack.
