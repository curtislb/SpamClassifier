ว้,

recently i finished the setup of a SAMBA server acting as a PDC Server
for (domain) joining WinXP clients. For understanding my setup and my
problem it is better first to explain with more details my whole setup.

First of all we speak for Linux Red Hat Enterprise 4 with the bult-in
samba packages in my setup.
I have setup my samba to act as a PDC for my internal Win XP clients. My
samba uses openldap server for authneticating users/computers.
The whole scenario seems to play well. After 2-3 weeks of operation the
process of joining and logging win XP clients to my PDC-SAMBA server has
a lot of problems. My logs

The behaviour is the following. A win XP client must do a lot of retries
to join/login to the domain and most of these retries are unsuccessful.
My network connection has no problem at all. The network cards of win XP
clients and PDC samba server have no problem at all.

Have you any idea about this problem?

Have you any solution about the above problem?
