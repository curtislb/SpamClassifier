Clearly X11() was found, so grDevices must be on the search path.
This error message is about X11 fonts.

It is allowed to exclude grDevices from the list of default packages, and 
if you do, it is not loaded.  That is a change in 2.5.0 but not a bug.
If you chose not to ask for it, we presume you did not want it.

Parts of graphics are useful without any graphics device and there are 
graphics devices in other packages, so it seemed reasonable to allow users 
the choice of whether they got grDevices.
