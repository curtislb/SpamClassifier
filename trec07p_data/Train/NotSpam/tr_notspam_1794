Dear adschai,

You needn't look too far, since the last example in ?sem is for a model with
an intercept. One would use the raw-moment matrix as input to sem(), either
entered directly or calculated with the raw.moments() function in the sem
package. The row/column of the raw-moment matrix is given a name just like
the other columns. You could use the name "1"; in the example, the name is
"UNIT".

As you say, however, you're using polychoric and polyserial correlations as
input. Since the origin and scale of the latent continuous variables
underlying the ordinal variables are entirely arbitrary, I can't imagine
what the purpose of a model with an intercept would be, but it's possible
that I'm missing something. If you think that this makes some sense, then
you could convert the correlations to raw moments by using the means and
standard deviations of the observed variables along with the means and
standard deviations that you assign to the latent variables derived from the
ordinal variables (the latter on what basis I can't imagine, but I suppose
you could fix them to 0s and 1s).

Finally, if the sem model that you show is meant to be a complete
specification, I notice that it includes no covariance components; moreover,
if this is the complete structural part of the model, then I think it is
underidentified, and the two parts of the model (those involving eta1 and
eta2) appear entirely separate.

I hope this helps,
 John
