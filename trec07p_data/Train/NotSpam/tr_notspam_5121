Hello sm1lies,

We have reposted two of the Time Tracker Application projects, now open under Development. 

* Java Custom Time Tracker Application Main Page Phase II Version 3.1 ($700)
* Java Custom Time Tracker Application My Account Config Phase II Version 3.1 ($1,200)
  More details here: http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=ViewActiveContests&ph=113

As a reminder, these two projects are essentially small assembly projects, rather than traditional component development projects. Check them out, and good luck!
