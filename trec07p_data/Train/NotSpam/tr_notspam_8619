Source installation is tricky.  You need to make sure you have all of
the dependencies perl needs (and not just the bare dependencies, but
all of the ones used to compile it like RedHat does) and that you
update everything that is tied to the old version of perl (e.g.
mod_perl).  This is why package management systems are nice (I have
become very lazy).

Life really sucks.  At least it sounds like it is a personal or
development machine rather than a production system.
