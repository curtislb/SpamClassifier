I think the role Parrot aims to fill is remains unfilled, although it is
being approached from both sides.  Check out this LLVM presentation, for
example:

    http://llvm.org/pubs/2007-03-12-BossaLLVMIntro.html

Look towards the ends of the slides:

    http://llvm.org/pubs/2007-03-12-BossaLLVMIntro.pdf

An excerpt:

    Call for help!

    ­ OSS community needs to unite work on various scripting languages
      ­ Common module to represent/type infer an arbitrary dynamic language
    ­ Who will provide this?  pypy? parrot? llvm itself someday ("hlvm")?

HLVM is actually in progress:

    http://hlvm.org/

Judging by how fast LLVM has progressed since Apple's been backing it
(almost two years now) LLVM/HLVM may be something to watch (or work with...)
