Hiya,
    The reason I couldn't use a hardware synth is precisely because I don't 
have a serial port on any of my machines.  It's downright annoying, but I 
wish there were support for USB to serial adaptors, or something along those 
lines.  Either that, or preferably USB synths directly.
Thanks much,
Zack.
