						David Cameron told us today what <b><a href=3D"http://news.bbc.co.uk/=
1/hi/uk_politics/6762515.stm">his big idea </b></a>is for government. To do=
 much less of it.=20
<br>

<br>
He wants people to make many more decisions at a local level, and take much=
 more control over running their communities - harnessing the philosophy of=
 the "<b><a href=3D"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">wiki</b></a>-ge=
neration".
<br>

<br>
"Every time we see a problem, we don't just ask what government can do. We =
ask what people can do, what society can do. That's the big difference betw=
een us and Zombie Brown, " he said.
<br>

<br>
Is it right to devolve power in this way or should we leave it to the polit=
icians we elect to make decisions on our behalf? Is it achievable? Is it so=
mething politicians find easy to promise in opposition, but harder to deliv=
er on in government? Is it a new idea, or is it one that is fundamental to =
the idea of Conservatism anyway?
<br>

<br>
Tell us what you think.
