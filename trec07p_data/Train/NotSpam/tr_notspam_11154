With your help, one summer can build a lifetime.

For thousands of Southern California’s children, going to summer camp
is simply not affordable. So here’s where you and the Los Angeles
Times can make a lasting difference, together.

Now in its 53rd year, the Los Angeles Times Summer Camp Campaign is
supported by generous people like you, and provides camp scholarships
so that deserving youngsters have an opportunity to enjoy:

• The thrill of discovering the great outdoors.
• The excitement of making new friends.
• The fun of learning new sports and activities.

Your donation today will add your name to a long list of compassionate
supporters who have helped the Times raise over $30 million and grant
more than 400,000 camp scholarships since 1954.

Plus, 100% of your gift goes directly to scholarships and the first
$1.1 million raised is matched 50 cents on the dollar by the McCormick
Tribune Foundation.

Go to:
http://email.latimes.com/cgi-bin1/DM/y/mBPD20TcLcT0TJ80F1we0FV
to make your donation today that will help send 9,000 children to camp
next summer. It’s one week that can build a lifetime of memories,
friendships and self-esteem.

Sincerely,

David Hiller
Publisher and Chief Executive Officer
