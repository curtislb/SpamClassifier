I presume the distinction you're making there is between license texts
that are already distributed in /usr/share/common-licenses/ and
license texts that aren't.

Distributing a license text that already exists in
/usr/share/common-licenses/ may (I can't recall) be against the
Policy; but why is it something we'd want to prevent on Social
Contract grounds?

If that's not what you're arguing, please explain.
