He could claim the license is terminated under 6.1, but presumably the
Debian maintainer would dispute such a claim.

The court in Berlin would have to not throw the case out on their
own accord (in spite of the difficulty in having your side of the case
presented, and in spite of the jurisdictional issues, the questionability
of the claim in the first place, and the difficulty in showing harm),
rule against you in absentia (agreeing with the arguments presented),
and could then only take action in so far you already operate in its
sphere of influence, or in so far as it can convince your government to
extradite you or enforce its rulings for them.

Should someone be willing to do that, and a court is willing to go
through all those steps with a choice of venue clause, what makes you
think they'd not do so in the absence of one?

Some people do. Microsoft considers the right to enforce its properly
obtained patents worth going to the trouble of distributing coupons
instead of SuSE itself, eg.

What makes you think the latter is true? I don't endorse the claim that
copyright licenses can take away usage rights if you're not making use of
the ability to modify or distribute that they offer you. In some cases
it may be enough to provide a simple notice like that to bind a user,
but that's dependent on your jurisdiction as a user more than a "choice
of venue clause", and I can't see any reason to think it applies to the
CDDL even so.

It's not a fee in the normal sense of the word, but it is a restriction
in the sense that if you're not able to do it (and you may well not be
able to), you're not able to make use of the priveleges you're offered
in return. That's where the analogy to a fee comes in -- it stops some
people from being able to participate.

For a choice of venue clause though, it only stops some people from
being willing to participate; just as potentially giving up patent rights
stops Microsoft from being willing to distribute Linux.

It's *possible* that it's still obnoxious enough that it's too much to
ask, but so far I can't see any significant cost to choice of venue that
makes it any worse than all the other weird and wacky things people put
in free software licenses.

I'm glad to see you write that; though I was referring more to Francesco's
post and similar than yours.=20

But even so, when you say things like "I'm personally more concerned
about licensing than the average developer" and "I [...] expect people
who disagree with my analysis to actually engage the analysis with
counter arguments, come to a complete understanding of the problem,
and then make a determination" you are saying your understanding is more
important than other people's.

Holding people who agree with you to that standard might be a way
to start?

Who is "we" in the above? For someone who's not a regular on -legal,
it doesn't sound like it includes me.

In any event, the important thing (afaics) isn't to have a forum where
regulars can post their understanding of issues, it's to help the people
you're communicating with have a better appreciation for the complexities
involved in their issue and how they might choose to approach them. That
can mean pointing out possible drawbacks in existing licenses, explaining
tradeoffs between licenses, or suggesting alternative ways of drafting
licenses that avoid having to make some tradeoffs, but it doesn't mean
making the tradeoffs for other people.

At present, the important drawbacks to the CDDL ttbomk are:

	* it's YA license
	* it's GPL incompatible

the benefits are:

	* it's a license that allows free use, distribution and
	  modification that Sun's comfortable using for some interesting
	  software, that's not otherwise available under a free license

and a vaguely interesting note is:

	* actually suing based on the license might be complicated by a
	  choice of venue

That you can argue the latter is analogous to a "fee" isn't really
very interesting. That some people are concerned about it is more so,
though so far the only concrete concern I've seen is MJ's comment --
"A possible arbitrary lawyer-fee-bomb, depending on the venue specified
and its sanity." and that's not really very concrete either.

No, punting to a GR is not a good solution -- it's slow to come to a
resolution, it annoys developers who have to inform themselves about
something they'd rather not worry about, and it ends up with -legal
folks complaining that the resolution doesn't make sense.

It's also not called for here -- we have CDDL software in the archive
and have notes from an ftpmaster and the DPL that it's acceptable. If
you want to change the current situation, you need to convince people
it needs to be changed.

(You'll note that in the GFDL case, changing from the then current
situation of not worrying about GFDL stuff had the support of all of
ftpmaster, the DPL, and the release managers amongst others)

Well, what you want and what your actions are likely to result in are

So talk about things on the level that they actually care about, rather
than the level you're most comfortable with.

For me, personally, that's practical problems that get in the way of
developing and promoting awesome free software -- and at the moment,
debian-legal rates far worse on that score than anything I've seen about
the CDDL does...

Can you see how someone might mistake those comments for something more
than just your personal opinion?

In particular compare saying "This is not the case" with, eg,
"I disagree".

(I'm not intending to imply that you're intentionally misleading anyone,
or that anyone else on -legal is. Personally, I'd say it's more an
artifact of the force with which we're in the habit of presenting our
views on Debian lists; but whatever the cause or intent, the problem's
in the effects.)

Right -- but the latter is an example of why we might well want to keep
CDDLed software in main, even though we might also want to help users
or redistributors understand potential problems they might face.

And again, I don't think I've seen any real statement of what those
problems actually *are*.

What makes it unwelcoming is the appearance of a consensus that doesn't
brook argument, even when that consensus differs significantly from that
of other sections of the free software (or open source) community.

Uh, I don't know who you mean by "we" there -- but Debian has many
official policies, even just counting the ones of the form "license
xyzzy is (not) DFSG-free".

I don't think that actually makes sense -- Debian's policy on this is
expressed by what will actually get accepted into the archive (or what
will get removed for license reasons). That's decided by consensus
(where it's obvious), by ftpmaster (where it's not entirely clear or
somewhat controversial) or by general resolution (where it's significantly
controversial).

But at that point Debian's policy on whether a given license meets the
DFSG is one of objective fact -- Debian does accept the GFDL as a free
license (ignoring invariant sections), and Debian does accept the CDDL
as a free license (at least when the choice of venue is Berlin).

You can entirely reasonably have opinions on whether there are better
ways of getting what you want, better licenses, whether the license meets
your personal standards of freedom, whether Debian's standards should be
different, whether this policy seems contradictory to some other policy,
or whatever else.

But the question of whether something is DFSG-free is fundamentally one
that's resolvable, and it needs to be seen that way.

If you want to be trusted to make similar rulings on behalf of the people
who intentionally made the decision you're calling "incorrect", then no,
it's not possible.

No, the reaction of saying things like:

because clearly everyone who voted for the winning option is the sort
of person who would think pi can be redefined willy-nilly, or that the

(Although while Anthony DeRobertis was a -legal regular at the time,
he doesn't seem to be a DD, maintainer or n-m applicant afaics. Does
that mean he's not a part of the consensus on -legal?)
