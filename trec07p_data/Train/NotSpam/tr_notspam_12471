I have applied corrections based on your comments and herewith enclose
the new draft of the header for the source files. If it is approved by
this list as no faults are found, I will go ahead and use it.

Please if there are any faults that must be corrected, tell me. If I do
not receive any such reports by the end of this month, I will assume
that the list has approved it and go ahead and apply it.

Thank you, as always.

Shriramana Sharma.
