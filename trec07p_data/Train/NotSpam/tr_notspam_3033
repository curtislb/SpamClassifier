It's not at all intended to insult your intelligence. (We have a lot of 
incredibly smart people working on Parrot.) It's purely a matter of 
"communication is clearly breaking down somewhere, so let's take a step 
back and figure out where our assumptions are different". The process 
would be much easier if we were all telepathic, but then telepathy has 
its own disadvantages.
