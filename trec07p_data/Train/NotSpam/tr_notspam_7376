Lou Dobbs Tonight
Thursday, May 3, 2007

Tonight, can the Democratic leadership and President Bush reach
a compromise on a bill to fund the war effort? We’ll have the
latest on what both sides are doing to come together following
the president’s veto this week.

Highly decorated former marine, Senator Jim Webb, sits down
with Lou to give us his reaction to the political deadlock over
the war in Iraq.

A monumental controversy: There’s outrage across America after
an artist from China is selected to create a new U.S. monument
of an American hero, using Chinese granite. We'll have that
shocking report.

And more dangerous Imports: Communist China has been
mislabeling products containing food substitutes like melamine
as non-food products to move them through inspections more
quickly. We’ll take a look at China’s practice and why it’s
dangerous for America.

Also, author Christopher Hitchens joins Lou tonight to discuss
his new book, God is Not Great: How Religion Poisons
Everything.

Visit http://cnn.com/loudobbstonight to read Lou’s
latest commentary on why illegal alien advocates picked a
peculiar day for the May Day marches.

Lou Dobbs lays out his manifesto to save the middle class in
his new book, “War on the Middle Class: How the Government, Big
Business, and Special Interest Groups Are Waging War on the
American Dream and How to Fight Back.” War on the Middle Class
is now on sale in bookstores near you and on Amazon.com and
BarnesandNoble.com.
