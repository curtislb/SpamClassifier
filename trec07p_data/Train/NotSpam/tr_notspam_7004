						<b>LOCAL ELECTIONS</b>
<br>

<br>
It's the last day of election campaigning across the country. Last night we=
 looked at Labour and the SNP's prospects. Paul Mason will be in the Midlan=
ds tonight looking at what would constitute a good night for the Tories and=
 LibDems. And we're hoping to speak to a member of the shadow cabinet and L=
ibDem front bench team live.=20=20=20
<br>

<br>
We'll also be speaking to the Leader of Plaid, Ieaun Wyn Jones about his ho=
pes in the elections tomorrow.
<br>

<br>
<b>CREVICE</b>
<br>

<br>
Tony Blair has again ruled out holding an independent inquiry into the suic=
ide bombings in London on the 7th of July 2005. The Conservative leader, Da=
vid Cameron said at Prime Minister's questions that one was needed to get t=
o the truth of the matter. We're still chasing new lines in this story. Wat=
ch this space.=20
<br>

<br>
<b>ISRAEL </b>
<br>

<br>
Israel's foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, says she'll challenge the country's=
 prime minister, Ehud Olmert, for the leadership of their party.  She says =
she's urged him to resign in the wake of a scathing report into Israel's co=
nflict with Hezbollah last year. We'll have the latest.=20
<br>

<br>
<b>IRAQ </b>
<br>

<br>
General Sir Michael Rose says, in a new book, that the US is in danger of m=
aking the same mistakes with insurgents in Iraq as the British made 200 yrs=
 ago in the War of Independence. He will be in debate live with a former se=
nior advisor to President Bush.=20
<br>
=20
<br>
<b>FRANCE</b>
<br>

<br>
We have a French election piece with a twist. On the night of the Sarkozy a=
nd Royal TV debate we have a film from Madeleine Holt. As France prepares f=
or the second round of its crucial Presidential election, the debate has ce=
ntred on how French society needs to change. But few would have predicted o=
ne new and critical voice entering the fray - the French cultural attach=C3=
=A9 to Britain. Yet Sophie Claudel says its time for the French to be more =
self-critical. She thinks they take themselves too seriously, French women =
hate each other and hardly anyone can cook anymore. To prove her points, sh=
e took our Culture Correspondent Madeleine Holt on a road trip round France=
.=20=20=20

Newsnight is on BBC2 at 10.30pm.
