5:21 AM, 6/15/07, 6/15/07, Update: Mixed results in computer restart attemp=
ts=20

Russian guidance and control computers aboard the international space stati=
on were disconnected from U.S. solar array power and ordered to restart ear=
ly today during a pass above Russian ground stations. Engineers reported mi=
xed initial results, with no "eureka moment" as troubleshooting continues.

The three redundant "lanes," or channels of the station's command and contr=
ol computer, known collectively as the central computer, along with all thr=
ee lanes of its guidance and navigation system, known as the terminal compu=
ter, were switched to Russian power for the restart attempts.

"Within the last 19 minutes or so, we have had some space-to-ground convers=
ation between the Russian mission control center (near Moscow) and space st=
ation commander Fyodor Yurchikhin, along with flight engineer Oleg Kotov," =
said NASA commentator Pat Ryan in mission control at the Johnson Space Cent=
er in Houston.

"Mission control called Kotov at 3:12 a.m. Houston time to alert him that t=
hey were going to retry another computer restart now that they were fully d=
isconnected from the U.S. power supply. Commanding began at 3:24 Central Ti=
me this morning with Moscow sending the command to deactivate the power con=
trollers and the response was up and down. There were some initial indicati=
ons that power was available to both the central computer and the terminal =
computer, initially to all three lanes of both computers, and then indicati=
ons that one or more lanes would drop off, the same sort of on-again, off-a=
gain responses seen earlier, and it was anticipated as the trouble shooting=
 continues."

It was not initially clear whether the computers were having trouble gettin=
g power, were trying and failing to reboot or both. A few minutes later, ho=
wever, Ryan reported that one lane of the central computer was, in fact, op=
erating.

"Space station flight director Holly Ridings just receiving a report from t=
he Houston support group at mission control in Moscow summarizing the attem=
pted Russian navigation computer restart this morning," Ryan reported. "The=
 current situation appears to be that all three lanes of both the central c=
omputer and terminal computer do have power. However, only lane No. 1 of th=
e central computer is currently working. Lane No. 2 on the terminal compute=
r has started, but then stopped, has gone in and out.

"Again, this is the situation that was expected as the procedures to restar=
t these computers are worked through, that there would not be a 'eureka' mo=
ment when they would all start up at the same time. This effort made this m=
orning, the Russians reported, when they were totally disconnected from U.S=
. power. The computers have not been commanded off, so they are very likely=
 continuing to try to restart themselves and the situation could change any=
 time."

The computer system has been acting up ever since the Atlantis astronauts a=
ttached a new set of solar arrays to the right side of the station's main p=
ower truss Monday. The terminal computer lanes initially crashed. Then, dur=
ing a programmed reboot of both the terminal and central computer lanes, th=
e entire system hung up.

The navigation system computers are required to fire Russian maneuvering je=
ts to make major changes in the station's orientation. Minor adjustments ar=
e made with U.S. control moment gyroscopes, but that cannot make major chan=
ges and the system periodically has to be reset using rocket control. The s=
tation cannot safely operate without full orientation control to ensure its=
 solar arrays stay face-on to the sun and to prevent sensitive systems from=
 getting too hot or too cold.

The problem is not serious as long as the shuttle Atlantis remains docked b=
ecause the orbiter's thrusters can be used, when needed, to make adjustment=
s that are beyond the ability of the gyros or when the gyro system needs to=
 be reset. But the shuttle will undock and return to Earth next week and th=
e Russians have been working around the clock to get the computer glitches =
resolved before the orbiter departs.

Engineers theorized that the new S4 solar array, or components in the circu=
itry delivering that power to the Russian segment of the station, triggered=
 some subtle change in the lab's electrical grid. The central and terminal =
computers, built in Germany by Daimler-Benz in Germany, are known to be sen=
sitive to "noisy" power.

Late Thursday, outgoing station flier Sunita Williams, her replacement Clay=
 Anderson and Kotov used a signal analyzer to characterize the power flowin=
g from the U.S. to the Russian segment. After that data was shared with the=
 ground, the system was physically disconnected to make sure no ground path=
 could be causing problems even with power shut down.

The space station will make repeated passes over Russian ground stations th=
is morning and additional troubleshooting efforts are expected.

The Atlantis astronauts are scheduled to wake up at 8:38 a.m. While the Rus=
sians are pressing ahead with computer troubleshooting, Jim Reilly and Dann=
y Olivas plan to begin a spacewalk at 1:38 p.m. to repair a pulled-up insul=
ation blanket on the shuttle's left-side rocket pod and complete the retrac=
tion, if possible, of the P6-2B solar array wing. A fourth spacewalk by Pat=
 Forrester and Steven Swanson is planned Sunday.
