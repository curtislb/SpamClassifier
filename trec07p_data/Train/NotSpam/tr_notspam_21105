Arte: Roma, torna a Santa Barbara dei Librai la pala rubata nel 2006

L'opera si trovava nell'abitazione di un collezionista romano. Arrestati due
ladri romani pluripregiudicati, specializzati in furti nelle chiese 

ascolta la notizia Roma, 19 giu. - (Adnkronos Cultura) - La banda
specializzata in furti d'arte nelle chiese, che agiva sulla piazza di Roma ?
stata sgominata. Il 26 settembre del 2006 aveva portato via dalla chiesa di
Santa Barbara dei Librai la pala d'altare raffigurante il "Paesaggio con
Madonna e Bambino verso il cielo, Santa Barbara, San Tommaso D'Aquino e San
Giovanni di Dio con frati o confratelli inginocchiati ai loro piedi". Ora,
grazie all'azione della sezione antiquariato del Comando Carabinieri Tutela
Patrimonio Culturale, la pala rinvenuta potr? tornare nella sua chiesa, per
la gioia dei fedeli e dei visitatori.

La pala, della quale non esisteva un'immagine leggibile che aiutasse i
Carabinieri nella ricerca, era accompagnata, sul retro, dalla lettera di
committenza del 1682 a firma del "Card. Fachenettus" che, rinvenuta in casa
di un collezionista romano, ha fornito la prova dell'identit? del dipinto
che si trovava, infatti, in una camera adiacente dell'abitazione. Il
rinvenimento della pala e di altri oggetti d'antiquariato e opere d'arte,
per un valore che sfiora mezzo milione di euro, rientra nello sviluppo e
prosecuzione di indagini gi? portare a termine, tra cui l'operazione Piazza
Pulita (2004/2005) e l'operazione Paliotto, riguardante la serialit? di
furti nel centro di Roma con la sua batteria parallela di Siena (2006).

"Queste indagini hanno portato, cinque giorni fa, all'arresto con ordinanza
di custodia cautelare di due ladri romani pluripregiudicati, specializzati
in furti d'arte nelle chiese: N.S. di quaranta anni, tossicodipendente e
S.B., di 48 anni - ha spiegato il tenente colonnello Ferdinando Musella -
ritenuti responsabili di almeno dieci dei furti nelle chiese romane
dell'ultimo periodo e di quello dei candelabri dal cimitero monumentale del
Verano". Individuati anche i truffatori che, presentandosi come una coppia
distinta, si conquistavano la fiducia degli antiquari dai quali prendevano
delle opere in prova, per vedere l'effetto che facevano nella loro lussuosa
dimora, salvo poi scomparire con la refurtiva. 

I truffatori, gi? pronti a mettere in atto un piano ai danni delle
televendite d'arte, sono stati trovati in una nuova casa all'estrema
periferia romana, verso i Castelli. La banda farebbe capo a una famiglia
romana nota nell'ambito delinquenziale. Tra le opere che mancavano
all'appello al termine delle operazioni Piazza Pultia e Paliotto, e che ora
sono state rinvenute, anche due veri e propri capolavori: l'olio su tela "La
caduta della manna" di Pierfrancesco Cittadini detto Il Milanese e la "Dama
a mezzobusto con rosa nei capelli" attribuito a Pompeo Batoni, entrambi
rubati dall'abitazione privata di un antiquario nei pressi di piazza di
Spagna. Tra le varie opere trafugate dalla dimora dell'antiquario, ora
mancano all'appello due preziose nature morte di Munari.

Tra le altre opere recuperate nell'ambito dello sviluppo delle indagini,
l'olio su tela "Il martirio di San Sebastiano", copia del tardo 1700 tratta
dall'originale di Guido Reni; una copia di pistole a pietra focaia e
avancarica firmate "Cassargnad"; una natura morta con frutta e garofano di
scuola fiamminga (XVII secolo); un crocefisso in avorio; un orologio da
tavolo con scultura raffigurante una fenice alata, del tardo 1700; il
dipinto "Visitazione della Madonna ad Elisabetta" (XVIII secolo) rubato
dalla Chiesa di Maria Santissima Immacolata di Siena e una serie di argenti
d'epoca.

Innsbrucker Kunstdiebstahl glimpflich verlaufen

Drei Gem?lde im Wert von rund 200.000 Euro sind einer Innsbrucker Familie am
vergangenen Freitag gestohlen worden. Zwei Bilder des ?sterreichers Alfons
Walde und eines des Schweizers Wilhelm Gimmi hatte ein Mitglied der Familie
entwendet. Es handelt sich um Waldes ?Prozession? im Wert von 120.000 Euro
und ?Zwei Bauern vor Schloss Tirol? im Wert von 60.000 Euro. Die ?Spanierin?
von Gimmi wird auf 15.000 Euro gesch?tzt. Der T?ter, der zus?tzlich zu den
Gem?lden 50 Goldm?nzen mitnahm, versuchte, die Objekte zu Geld zu machen.
Inzwischen tauchten die Bilder bei einem Innsbrucker H?ndler wieder auf und
wurden von der dortigen Polizei sichergestellt. Da die Tat im Kreise der
Familie geschehen sei, werde sie nicht als Verbrechen gewertet, erkl?rten
die Beh?rden in Innsbruck. Bereits im Herbst letzten Jahres wurde ein
?lgem?lde Alfons Waldes aus einer alarmgesicherten Lagerhalle in Innsbruck
gestohlen. Das Bild ?Aufstieg der Skifahrer?, mit einem Sch?tzwert von
500.000 Euro, wurde ebenfalls kurz nach dem Diebstahl wieder aufgefunden.

Weston Police help in search for violin

Weston - Nearly five years after Frederic Bednarz's violin was stolen from a
Harvard Square music school, police have found the $24,000 instrument. But
it's unclear if police ever plan to charge the crooks involved in the
high-profile heist.
For Bednarz, a Montreal-born violinist, the return of the pricey
19th-century violin is a case of too little, too late.
"Well, you know, it's been such a long time that I've dealt with it and
bought another violin," said Bednarz.
In 2002, Bednarz's violin was stolen from his locker in the basement of the
Longy School of Music while he was at lunch. At the time, Bednarz had just
arrived in Boston for a two-year stint as a professional studies student at
school working toward his artist diploma in chamber music performance. Staff
and musicians searched the school for days, but couldn't find the violin,
which Bednarz had borrowed from his Montreal sponsor.
Then, last November, Weston Police received a tip about the violin and
Cambridge Police recovered the stolen instrument, according to Weston Police
Chief Steven Shaw. 
Investigators in Weston and Cambridge began working together on the case
when the violin was first stolen five years ago and revived the partnership
when Weston Police received the tip last year.
"It never really fell off the radar screen," said Shaw.
Police at both departments are keeping the details about the violin's
recovery under wraps. Cambridge Police are refusing to discuss the case or
say how the rare instrument was found. No one has been charged with the
theft, and it's unclear whether Cambridge Police ever plan to make an arrest
in the case. 
"That's all we're going to give out," said police spokesman Frank
Pasquarello, who refused to give a reason for withholding the information.
The violin was earlier rumored to be from the 1700s, one of the rare violins
still in existence today crafted by Italian Santo Serafin. More recently,
however, experts estimated the instrument was made in Venice, Italy, around
1800.
At the time of the theft, musicians suspected the violin was stolen by teens
who didn't know the value of the instrument. Police and instrument dealers
had said the rare violin would be hard to sell on the open market without
drawing attention.
The insurance company has since refunded the money for the instrument, and
Bednarz bought and tried playing several instruments in past years, finally
settling on another older instrument.
"It's not exactly what I had, but I like it," said Bednarz.
The insurance company sold Bednarz's stolen violin at Tarisio auction house
last month, according to Chris Reuning, owner of Reuning & Son Violins in
Boston.
The violin sold at auction for $24,150, said Reuning, one of the founding
partners of Tarisio.
Tarisio is the world's largest auction house for stringed instruments and
sells more than 2,000 violins, violas, cellos and bows each year.
As for Bednarz, he moved back to Montreal this week to play with the
Molinari Quartet and doesn't mind that his former violin has a new owner.
Said Bednarz, "That's OK. I'm sure someone's happy."

'No questions' if sculpture is returned

FOREST PARK, Ill., June 19 (UPI) -- The Forest Park, Ill., owners of a
missing 500-pound elephant sculpture say they won't press charges if the
item is returned. 
The 3-by-4 foot pachyderm is believed to have been taken last week from
outside an art studio and gallery, the Chicago Sun-Times reported Tuesday. 

"The owners say that if they get it back, there would be no questions
asked," Forest Park police Deputy Chief Tom Aftanas told the Sun-Times. 

The sculpture, which was decorated with thousands of brightly colored and
mirrored glass squares as part of the city's "Elephants on Parade" exhibit,
is believed to have been stolen Wednesday night or Thursday morning, the
newspaper said. 

"It would have taken some effort to move this thing," he said. "You could
see drag marks on the sidewalk."

Is Art being Stolen to Order?        
Written by Sandra Hodgson and Mark Brassingto     
Wednesday, 20 June 2007 
 
Now we know that art is becoming mainstream, as theft is becoming the order
of the day, as thieves in hoodies target prints by Banksy the anonymous and
faceless graffiti artist. Then a few days later; the conviction of the
boyfriend of the Olympian Myriam B?dard, for theft of paintings of the late
Ghitta Caiserman-Roth. Nima Mazhari was convicted on the 5th of June of
stealing the paintings worth $100,000. And in Milwaukee a Delacroix drawing
has

Art theft can hardly ever have seemed more fashionable than in this last
traumatic week. Nima Mazhari has been convicted of stealing work by Ghitta
Caiserman-Roth worth $100,000. A gang of youths called "hoodies" has made
off with Banksy prints from a theft in Brighton. And in Milwaukee a work by
Delacroix stolen some two years ago from a gallery in Milwauke has been
returned, by a man who says he found it in the trash!

As works become more popular and expensive thieves who previously would have
thought a Mondrian was a new alco-pop are unfortunately starting to take an
interest in some of the more popular works of art available today. The hype
of the anonymous Banksy have clearly increased visibility of his works to
such an extent that an exhibition of his work has been closed. Stuart
Hobday, Director said "It's a real shame that this exhibition is not going
ahead, but the risk of the art being stolen was fairly high and we
understand the concern raised by the owner of the works."

Because Banksy's works are graffiti they are often easier to steal than
traditional works, because of their public nature. Last year a work was cut
from a section of wall in Paddington and later auctioned on eBay for
?20,000. Murals were also ruined in Whitechapel last month when thieves
tried to chisel the works from the wall.

Mary Jane Ansell a figurative painter based a few doors away on the North
Laines has said; "Yes, the Artrepublic is very close to my studio, but I
don't know anyone involved: - honest!" She then continues to say that.
Banksy is a hugely popular artist locally and obviously his work is becoming
ever more attractive to investors and the public alike so no doubt there
will be a way to move them on easily, certainly I wouldn't be surprised if
they were stolen to order.

As there can never be doubt as to the authenticity of these works the issues
raised that there is a ready market for such works are huge. Whilst the
works may not actually be being sold on eBay there is clearly a market for
sale and even more importantly re-sale of such "known to be stolen" works.
This is important because if such a market did not exist works would not be
stolen in the first place.

Now that the Banksy show has been canceled at Norwich the question is now
being asked as to whether the publics' access to such works will now be
compromised. Of course these works will be seen again in public but the
necessary security barriers will surely damage the viewers' experience.
Further problems will also arise as city underwriters re-assess the already
punitive insurance premiums for such shows.

The conclusion though Mary Jane states is that in a perverse way it actually
illustrates how much more mainstream art is becoming these days and could
actually be encouraging for young artists wishing to make their name. The
fashionable cache of Banksy's work has been increased by the purchase of his
works by such celebrities as Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt and Jude Law.

Men charged in theft of Stevie Ray Vaughan memorabilia 

AUSTIN - Two men have been charged with stealing music memorabilia that once
belonged to late blues guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan from his brother's
storage unit, police said.

Police have recovered several items they believe were Vaughan's, including
movie screenplays, handwritten song lyrics, photographs of Vaughan with
other musicians, guitar pick guards, unused concert tickets and backstage
passes, according to a probable cause affidavit.

Police said several hundred thousand dollars worth of items are still
missing, including six guitars and other items.

Jimmie Vaughan's manager, Cory Moore, said the missing guitars belong to
Jimmie.

"I can assure you that all of Stevie's guitars are in safekeeping," Moore
said.

Police have charged Michael Shane Winders, 37, and James Matthew Malone, 29,
with theft, a second-degree felony. Both have warrants for their arrest but
haven't been picked up as of Tuesday afternoon, Austin police spokesman Toni
Chovonetz said. Bail had been set at $100,000 for Winders and $132,000 for
Malone. Information on the men's attorneys was not available early Tuesday.

According to the affidavit, police arrested Malone at a hotel in April on
suspicion of possession of a controlled substance. Police found items in the
room they believed to belong to Stevie Ray Vaughan.

Jimmie Vaughan reported several days later that his storage unit had been
ransacked twice in the preceding weeks. Jimmie Vaughan identified the stolen
merchandise at a police warehouse, the affidavit said.

In the affidavit, police said Malone and Winders tried to sell some of the
material to an auction house in Dallas.

Spie Norwine, director of music memorabilia for Heritage Auction Galleries
in Dallas, said he was approached by two men in May about selling some
Vaughan memorabilia, including the handwritten lyrics to the song "Pride and
Joy."

"When the items were in our possession, using due diligence, we contacted
Craig Hopkins of the Stevie Ray Vaughan Museum, who said the items were
authentic," Norwine said.

Norwine said Hopkins notified Jimmie Vaughan, and the auction house learned
about the Austin break-in. Norwine contacted Austin police, and the auction
house turned the items over to police earlier this month.

LA's Getty Gets New Chief of Antiquities
By Associated Press
7:55 PM PDT, June 20, 2007 


LOS ANGELES -- The J. Paul Getty Museum, under fire by countries that
contend some of its priceless ancient art collection was stolen, on
Wednesday announced the appointment of a new curator of antiquities.

Karol Wight, an expert in ancient Roman glass, will be in charge of a staff
of eight and about 2,500 sculptures, pottery, jewelry and other ancient
artworks.

Most of the artwork is housed at the Getty Villa at Malibu.

Wight's appointment fills the last of several key vacancies in the museum.
Earlier this year, former Art Institute of Chicago president James N. Wood
took over as chief of the J. Paul Getty Trust, which operates the museum.

"Her passion for the job and long experience in the field of antiquities,
combined with a deep understanding of the Getty's collection, make her the
ideal choice for this important position," museum director Michael Brand
said in a statement.

Wight becomes curator next month. She has been acting curator since Marion
True retired from the post in October 2005. She began her career at the
Getty in 1985 as a graduate intern in the Department of Antiquities.

True and art dealer Robert Hecht have been placed on trial in Rome, charged
with knowingly receiving dozens of archaeological treasures stolen from
private collections or dug up illicitly. They deny any wrongdoing.

Last December, the museum settled a decade-old dispute with Greece, agreeing
to hand over an ancient gold wreath and marble bust that Athens claims were
illegally spirited out of the country. It earlier returned two sculptures.

The museum also agreed last year to return 26 antiquities to Italy, but that
country is demanding the return of many more and negotiations have stalled.

The criticism has come in writing from Interpol secretary-general Ronald K.
Noble. In a two-page long letter he refers to repeated written and verbal
enquiries to Norwegian police about information about who was responsible
for the theft of the Munch masterpieces "The Scream" and "Madonna", without
receiving an answer.

"As a result of this, violent criminals who were responsible for one of the
major art thefts of recent decades are still not registered in Interpol's
database," Noble wrote according to newspaper VG.

Noble claims that the reticence of Norwegian police can have major
consequences, including an inability to hinder similar types of crimes in
the future.

Police Director Ingelin Killengreen rejected the criticism and told VG that
she had spoken with Noble two weeks ago.

"We said that we should have been better at informing them that we could not
supply this information. Due to considerations concerning the investigation
the Oslo police do not wish to supply the information Interpol has
requested," Killengreen said.

Kunstdiebst?hle in Genf und G?nserndorf
Betroffen: Kautschukplastik von Beuys und Stierkampfzeichnung von Picasso 

Genf/G?nserndorf - Einem Privatmann sind in der N?he von Genf ein Werk von
Joseph Beuys sowie eine bedeutende Sammlung afrikanischer Kunst gestohlen
worden. Wie die Genfer Kantonspolizei am Mittwoch mitteilte, bel?uft sich
der Wert der Beute auf 2,4 Millionen Franken (knapp 1,5 Millionen Euro).
Demnach stiegen die T?ter bereits w?hrend der Osterferien in das Haus ein
und lie?en sich auch von den Alarmsystemen nicht davon abhalten, eine T?r
des Haupteingangs aufzuwuchten.

Beim Diebesgut handelt es sich den Angaben zufolge um das Werk von Beuys aus
Kautschuk ohne Titel aus dem Jahre 1977. Au?erdem wurden rund 140
Kunstgegenst?nde aus Afrika entwendet, darunter Masken, rituelle Ger?te und
Statuen. Sie stammen unter anderem vom Dogon-Volk aus Mali. Die Polizei geht
davon aus, dass es sich bei den T?tern um Kunstkenner handelt. 

Umfassender Diebeszug

Eine Picasso-Zeichnung im Wert von mehr als 250.000 US-Dollar ist am
Dienstag aus einem Einfamilienhaus im Bezirk G?nserndorf gestohlen worden.
Wie das Landeskriminalamt Nieder?sterreich am Mittwoch mitteilte, d?rften
die unbekannten T?ter auch eine Lithographie des K?nstlers erbeutet haben.
Ob es sich allerdings tats?chlich um Originale handelt, werde nun gepr?ft. 

Die gestohlene Zeichnung "Corrida" zeigt eine Stierkampfszene. Die
Kriminellen lie?en neben teuren Anz?gen, Uhren sowie Handys auch eine
wom?glich echte Lithographie von Picasso, "Lysistrata", mitgehen. Diese war
mit der Unterschrift des K?nstlers versehen. Ein von Picasso signiertes
Taschenbuch fiel den Kriminellen ebenfalls in die H?nde. Die erbeuteten
Gegenst?nde - die Zeichnung "Corrida" ausgenommen - haben laut N?
Sicherheitsdirektion einen Wert von 41.700 Euro.

Die Ermittler m?ssen nun die Herkunft der gestohlenen Gegenst?nde kl?ren.
Wann Gewissheit herrscht, ob es sich bei den gestohlenen Kunstwerken
tats?chlich um Werke von Pablo Picasso handelt, stand laut Landeskriminalamt
vorerst noch nicht fest. 

Die Diebe waren durch ein Kellerfenster in das Haus der russischen Besitzer
gelangt. Die R?umlichkeiten seien zum Zeitpunkt der Tat leer gestanden.
Nicht gekl?rt sei vorerst, ob die Kriminellen die Zeichnung "Corrida"
gezielt ausgew?hlt oder lediglich zuf?llig mitgenommen hatten. (APA/AP)

Thieves take Beuys painting, African art in $1.9 million Swiss heist 

The Associated Press 
Wednesday, June 20, 2007 

GENEVA: A painting of Joseph Beuys and a collection of African art worth around 2.4 million Swiss francs (US$1.9 million, ?1.42 million) were stolen from a house near Geneva, police said Wednesday.

The thieves broke into the house and carried away the art on April 12, said Patrick Pulh of the police for the canton of Geneva.

They stole 140 objects from the private collection, including masks and statues from West Africa, he said.

No arrests have been made, Pulh said.

The artworks, which came from countries like Mali, Cameroon, Ghana and Ivory Coast, included several tall masques, including a wooden mask with a crest measuring 1.89 meters (6.2 feet), according to the insurance company which registered the collection.

"Some of the objects have a value of over 100,000 francs, but most of them are worth around 10,000 francs," said Barbara Koenig, spokeswoman for Allianz insurance.

The haul also includes an untitled 1977 painting made of natural rubber by German avant-garde artist Beuys. The painting has an estimated value of 198,000 francs (US$159,500; ?119,000), Koenig said.

Police said they assume that the thieves were art experts.

The pencil drawing 'Corrida' dates from 1920 and is valued at 180,000 Euro

A Picasso drawing, valued at 180,000 ? has been stolen from the house of a Russian diplomat, a few kilometres from Vienna in Austria. In addition to the artwork the thieves also took several watches and expensive suits.

The drawing, called ?Corrida? is a bullfighting scene and shows a bull charging a horse in the bullring. It dates from 1920 and is pencil on paper some 30 by 20 cms in size.

Police say they are looking for a gang of professional thieves, who knew exactly what they were after. Police also note that there were no security measures in place in the diplomat?s house, apart from a dog who welcomed anyone who called.
