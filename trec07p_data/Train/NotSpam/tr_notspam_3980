No. Running localtime will automatically correct for DST.  The new US DST
was compensated for quite some time before the change was in effect.  I only
had problems on some clients' unpatched winslop boxes.  The Debian package
that keeps track of this is tzdata - if it's kept updated, political changes
of timezones will be compensated for.

Yep.  I do this on all my straight *nix boxes - easier that way, and IMHO
much more sane.

I believe the OP was doing a dual boot with winslop, hence the extra
gyration.

Cheers,

Dave.
