I managed to get access to the Vista system again.  The changes that have been
made to Samba recently *do* appear to have solved the problems with accessing
Vista.  I'm now able to both enumerate shares and access files on the Vista
machine that was inaccessible during my initial tests.

Interestingly, it's now negotiating NTLMSSP just like it does with W2k, which
it was not doing in my previous tests.

Anyway, it seems that the big problem I thought we had doesn't exist.  That's
nice to know.

Cheers,

Derrell
