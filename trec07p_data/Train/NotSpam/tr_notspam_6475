Hey Adisa,

You could try ccMixter but you may not get such a great response.  =
ccMixter isn't really about collaboration in that sense, though some of =
the community (myself included) are trying to campaign for a slight =
shift away from total competition focus.

Kompoz.com is also worth looking at, it's a new contender and they're =
interested in new members with cool ideas.  They have slightly greater =
license flexibility too, because they have the SA kinds of licenses.

There's nothing wrong with making money from your hard work, but it's =
also fun to give things away or at least allow folks to share your stuff =
without fear of being sued!=20

:)

Good luck!

Kev

I was thinking of posting songs (music and vocals) on ccmixter or a =
