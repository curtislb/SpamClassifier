HEADLINE: State of the Clinical Trials Industry 2007 Sourcebook Charts Drug
Pipeline Trends Affecting Healthcare Industry;
Thomson Healthcare Compendium Tracks Growth of Clinical Research
Outsourcing,
Rates Top Clinical Trial Sponsors and Analyzes Industry-Wide Spending Data

DATELINE: BOSTON May 2
copied as fair use


   BOSTON, May 2  /PRNewswire/ -- Russia is on track to become the next big
clinical research market; global pharma R&D spending is projected to top
$100
billion in 2007; and convenience is the number one concern of patients
participating in clinical trials. These are just three of the hundreds
of data
points and research observations featured in State of the Clinical Trials
Industry 2007, an annual sourcebook produced by Thomson CenterWatch, a
leading
provider of information and solutions to the clinical trials industry, and a
business within of The Thomson Corporation (NYSE: TOC; TSX: TOC).

   State of the Clinical Trials Industry 2007 is a comprehensive
resource that
examines all aspects of the clinical trials industry, providing original
CenterWatch data gleaned from in-depth industry analyses, physician and
patient
surveys and report-card-style ratings of pharmaceutical sponsors and
clinical
researchers. Data highlights included in the 400-plus page book include:

  *  Causes and costs associated with study delays;
   *  Trial success based on company size;
   *  Clinical Research Organization (CRO) market size, costs and
      performance;
   *  Investigative site perceptions of sponsors and CROs within the US,
      Europe, and Latin America; and
   *  Worldwide sales (within the pharmaceutical, medical device, and
biotech
      sectors);
   *  Overall R&D spending and cycle times;
   *  Regulatory submissions and approvals within the US and
internationally.


   "The most compelling observations in this year's edition of State of the
Clinical Trials Industry focus on the significant challenges pharmaceutical
companies have faced with clinical trial recruitment," notes Mary Jo
Lamberti,
senior manager of Market Research for Thomson CenterWatch. "To manage these
challenges, companies are looking outside the U.S., particularly toward
Asia,
Latin America, and more recently, to Russia, to conduct clinical
trials," she
said. "State of the Clinical Trials Industry provides insights to these and
other trends, and helps clinical researchers, biotech and pharmaceutical
executives, CRO executives and investment analysts track and react to
changes in
the industry."

   State of the Clinical Trials Industry 2007 contains over 500 charts,
graphs,
and tables; a review of the top clinical research stories of 2006 as
reported by
the editorial staff of The CenterWatch Monthly; as well as drug pipeline
information and updates on specific disease areas. Much of the data is
based on
CenterWatch's clinical research benchmarking surveys that have been
conducted
across global segments and represents an analysis of current sponsor and CRO
practices.  The 2007 edition features more than 100 completely new charts
analyzing the clinical research industry along with hundreds more
updated slides
from our 2006 edition.
