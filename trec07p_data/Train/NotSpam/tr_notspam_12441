Assuming the R packages have been downloaded locally and end with 
tar.gz, then how about simply changing to where the files are located 
and typing the following command?

  ls *.tar.gz | while read x; do echo "R CMD INSTALL $x"; done | bash


Alternatively, you can use the install.packages() function in R.
