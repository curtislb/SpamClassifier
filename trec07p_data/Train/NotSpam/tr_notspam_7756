Here's a note from Troy Roberts on Saturday's 48 Hours Mystery, POWER, PASS=
ION AND POISON:=20

"Kathy Augustine was a rising star in Nevada state politics. Smart, ambitio=
us, tough and attractive she quickly ascended to one of the highest offices=
 in the state and many expected she'd eventually end up working in national=
 politics. But last year Kathy Augustine was found unconscious in her bed a=
nd later died at the hospital. She was fifty-years-old. At first it was ass=
umed that Augustine died from a heart attack. But her family and friends di=
dn't believe it could be possible. Augustine had her annual physical just a=
 week before her death. She was given a clean bill of health and there was =
no family history of heart disease. It just didn't add up.=20

Toxicology tests were ordered on fluid samples taken from Augustine and the=
 results shocked everyone. Traces of the powerful paralytic drug Succinylch=
oline were found in her system. The drug is normally given to patients to e=
ase the insertion of a breathing tube. It acts fast and nearly vanishes fro=
m the body within minutes...making it extremely difficult to detect. Suspic=
ions quickly fell on Augustine's husband of three years, Chazz Higgs. The p=
air seemed an unlikely couple. He was eight-years her junior. He was a body=
builder who had three failed marriages behind him. His relationship with Ka=
thy was troubled as well. In the months leading up to Augustine's death the=
y had discussed divorce. But there was more. Chaz Higgs was a critical care=
 nurse and he had access to Succincolyine. He knew how to adminster it and,=
 most importantly, he knew the drug could be potentially deadly. And then a=
 witness came forward with a damning claim about his allegedly role in the =
crime.=20

Chazz Higgs goes on trial for the murder of Kathy Augustine next month. Hig=
gs claims he is innocent. When we sat down for the interview, that you'll s=
ee this weekend, he agreed to talk about the charges against him...charges =
that could send him to prison for life, and you'll hear his theories on who=
 would want his wife dead...and why. I hope you'll join us on Saturday nigh=
t."=20

Hi everyone,=20

Today a Defense Department panel warned that more than one-third of U.S. tr=

special perseverance - and a unique perspective on the roadside attacks tha=
t injure so many American troops: Specialist Jordan Spurlin has survived fo=
ur IED explosions. Now he's sharing his story.=20

A boat carrying an estimated 150 Haitian migrants capsized in the Atlantic =
Ocean this morning. Kelly Cobiella will have the latest on the Coast Guard'=
s frantic search for survivors.=20

Ten presidential hopefuls lined up on stage last night, but what memorable =
about it? Our senior political correspondent Jeff Greenfield will have a re=
view of the first Republican debate.=20

Queen Elizabeth II is causing quite a stir at the site of one of America's =
first colonies. Mark Phillips will follow her through Jamestown - where Bri=
ts settled 400 years ago - and take a look back through its history and how=
 it is recently being revised.=20

A bit of trivia: Who is the only sitting U.S. senator to serve on active du=
ty in Iraq? Sharyl Attkisson will have that exclusive story tonight, and sh=
e'll explain the work this lawmaker has done recently for the military.=20

Finally, for Assignment America Steve Hartman will have a sweet story about=

HAPPINESS MYTH: Can a person achieve true happiness? Not the traditional wa=
y is Jennifer Michael Hecht's answer, author of The Happiness Myth: Why Wha=
t We Think Is Right Is Wrong. In her new book, she asks her readers to reth=
ink the modern methods of pursuing happiness - through money, our bodies, c=

lowing the queen's visit to the U.S. and will bring us the latest on her ac=

eople are opting for cremation these days. And there are more and more ways=
 to turn those ashes into memorials to the departed. They can be scattered =
at sea, or made into jewelry, sporting equipment, artificial reefs, or even=
 fireworks. One of the most dramatic tributes is to shoot them into space. =
Last weekend, Bill Geist traveled to New Mexico where a private rocket laun=
ched so-called "cremains" of 202 people into space. Onboard were some of th=
e ashes of pioneering astronaut Zombie Cooper and James Doohan-"Scotty" fro=
m Star Trek. We'll meet the families of some of those on-board, and learn m=
ore about how the baby boomers are redefining even death.=20
