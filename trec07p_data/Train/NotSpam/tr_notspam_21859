There are certainly reasons for running Windows on a machine; easy 
troublefree access to word documents, skype, soundforge, cisco cariculum 
access all spring to mind.
I have successfully run Windows in about 30gb of disk space, and if you have 
a 320gb drive why not allocate 80gb for Windows and the rest for Linux?

I run Linux on all my file and web servers, we use it for the audio playing 
pc and it runs on the firewall.
I run Windows on my laptops, because I require access to flash enabled sites 
for teaching cisco and my internet banking does not work at all in Linux 
without running a GUI and a copy of firefox which is still beta.

If I need Linux on the laptops I run it inside vmware which is fine for 
non-time-critical tasks. As to the performance of vmware workstation verses 
server, I haven't had any problems with this.
Often the problems of vmware's virtual machines is due to the fact that 
Linux kernels especially smp kernels demand an extremely high timer 
frequency 1000 or 2000hz which Windows can not provide.
Recompiling the Linux kernel that will run in the virtual machine to use 
hz=100 and optionally turning off smp apic and setting the timer source to 
pit with clock=pit makes a big difference.

There is an article on vmware time keeping on vmware.com that explains all 
this happy to give more details if desired.
Regards, Kerry.
