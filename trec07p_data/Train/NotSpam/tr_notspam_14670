Being dialog-based doesn't cause too many problems, I was able to 
successfuly install debian sarge on an Alpha PWS over serial console.  
Cursor tracking isn't as good as if speakup was running on the machine 
I was installing to, but it was still useable.

Seriously, the way I did this was by using a special /sbin/loader binary
with debugging hooks that I made ("dd" is your friend: binary editors
are for wimps).
