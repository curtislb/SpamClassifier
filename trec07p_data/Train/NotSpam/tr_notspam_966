yYou should have no problem running linux in vmware using your 
hardware synth provided the machine has a physical serial port.  I 
have both fedora and debian running in a copy of vmware on top of 
windows here and it works fine, you just have to go into the settings 
page for the virtual machine and add a serial port mapped to the 
physical serial port on your machine.
