I was thinking of posting songs (music and vocals) on ccmixter or a similar site and leaving space for people to add their own verses.  then selecting versions i like and asking if the artist would like enter into an agreement to sell the songs through cd baby, itunes, record stores, etc. we would then share the profits of the sales.i have read many forums and discussions in the past and i can not tell if this in alignment with the creative commons spirit. also, what version(s) of the creative commons would i apply?
