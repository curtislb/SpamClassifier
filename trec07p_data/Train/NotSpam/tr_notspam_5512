open(FH, "<", 'E:\Games\readme.txt');
You've asked four separate questions here: one on paths, one onglobbing, one on finding files, and one pipes. You should probablysplit them up into four threads, but here goes:
If you had really read the glob perldoc, you would have seen that itpoints you to File::Glob where everything is expalined and there areat least six examples.  Briefly, then, globbing is a way of generatinglists of files that match certain criteria. It deliberately imitatesthe behavior of popular unix shells. Something like
    my @files = <*.doc>;
will find all the files in the current directory with filenames endingin ".doc". To use it with open, you'd put it in a loop, e.g.:
    while (<*.doc>) {        open(FH, ">", $_) or die "$!\n";        # do something        close FH;    }
This makes it convenient to work with multiple files that match aparticular patter, but it doesn't change the fact that to open a file,you have to know where it is. since only you know your filesystem andwhere your files might be stored, you have to provide a valid relativeor absolute path. If you don't know where the file is, you need tofind it somehow. File::Find would be a good place to start.
Pipes are something else entirely. A pipe lets you pass output fromfrom one program to another. opening a pipe for reading will let youread the output of another program into your perl program. Opening apipe for writing will pass whatever you write to the filehandle to anexternal program. So something like
    open(FH, ">", "| /WINDOWS/System32/notepad.exe") or die "$!\n";
Would send anythig you print to FH on along to notepad. But sincenotepad doesn't, I think, read from STDIN, it probably won't doanything useful. You'll probably need to use Win32::OLE or some otherWindows API to pass your data to notepad.
