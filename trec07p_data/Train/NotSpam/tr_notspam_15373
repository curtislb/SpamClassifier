Hi, going to the speakupmodified.org site it still says 6 is the most
current release.  Where can I get the new version of fedora core 7 with
speakup?  It would also be a great idea if you could make the CD and DVD
versions released on cheapbytes as even with a dsl modem it can take a
long time to download them.On Fri, 1 Jun 2007, Janina Sajka wrote:
