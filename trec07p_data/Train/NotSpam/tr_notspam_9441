						What is it about Michael Howard and Newsnight?=20
<br>

<br>
The former Conservative leader already holds the accolade for the greatest-=
ever Newsnight moment with, of course, that interview with Jeremy in 1997 i=
n which he failed to answer the same question 12 times in a row (watch it <=
b><a href=3D"http://news.bbc.co.uk/player/nol/newsid_4190000/newsid_4195800=
/4195849.stm?bw=3Dbb&mp=3Drm">here</b></a>).=20
<br>

<br>
Last night he made a renewed bid for YouTube immortality in an extraordinar=
y moment of theatre involving his old adversary Alastair Campbell. Howard a=
nd Campbell were live in Newsnight's studio discussing Blair's legacy, and =
as midnight hovered into view something of the night seemed to overtake Mr =
Howard. He launched a savage and sustained attack on Campbell's modus opera=
ndi, effectively blaming him for the ills of the Blair years and accusing h=
im of using lies as a weapon of government.=20
