Let's hope next time there will be some kind of vote (not a GR, just a 
poll or something). Personally, I find the current DI theme boring and 
would have preferred a moreblue-like theme like the Debian Desktop is 
now using by default.

I Disagree. Because the shape of the swirl is usually enough to make the 
connection to the "real" logo and the organization behind it, we should 
be pretty much free for all color variations. The Etch desktop theme is 
a perfect example how things could look like (fresh, modern) if we don't 
limit to use the same boring logo-color-combo again and again.

Event the MS Windows logo changed over the years, but you still make the 
connection if you see one of them. So we really shouldn't limit us to 
the original *red* swirl and the *red* "dot" on the i in "Debian". It 
looks boring (like our homepage and our wiki BTW).


Cheers,

Bastian
