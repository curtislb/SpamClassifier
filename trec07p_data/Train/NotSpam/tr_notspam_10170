In fact it makes the code easier to read. At least to me.
The other day I had a lot of work to do with matlab code, and it just
sucked. No variables where declared, and therefore I had no type
information. I didn't knew if arguments passed to functions were
arrays/matrices or scalars, and sigils would have helped very much.

And don't say "but a good IDE.." - I didn't have one. No language should
depend on its IDE's syntax hilighting.

I paraphrased Larry Wall. Iirc it was "everybody wants the semicolon" or
something - correct me if I'm wrong.

I think the p6 grammar is so complex that you couldn't do it without a
statement terminator, be it a semicolon or a newline. And we know that
you prefer the newline, I (and it seems, many other) do prefer semicolons=

most languages don't allow you to call a function without parentheses.
if you have

foo bar

without a statement termination, you can't know if thats
foo(bar()),
or
foo()
bar()
whereas if you force the parentheses, it is unambigous anyway.

Which explains why languages with simpler syntax can well live without
the semicolon.

because, as was pointed out earlier, huge changes
a) delay implementation significantly and
b) change the character of the language too heavily. We want Perl 6 to
be Perl still.

Most of these issues have been discussed in one way or another, either
on p6l or on use.perl.org. If you really want the arguments, you'll find
most of them.

Right.
