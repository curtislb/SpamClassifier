It fails for me too (MacOSX 10.4.9, Intel Core 2 Duo), but it was marked 
as TODO for the release.

t/stm/llqueue............................ok 1/2 
      #     Failed (TODO) test (t/stm/llqueue.t at line 59)# 
got: ''#     expected: 'sum is 4950# '# './parrot -D40 --gc-debug 
"/Users/allison/projects/svn/parrot/t/stm/llqueue_2.pir"' failed with 
exit code [SIGNAL 11]

chromatic, your patch does seem to fix the problem for me, but then so 
does running 'make realclean'. (I've been getting intermittent test 
hangs with STM on various different tests for a few weeks now, and they 
always go away when I run 'realclean'. And, when I set out to track them 
down, they disappear.)
