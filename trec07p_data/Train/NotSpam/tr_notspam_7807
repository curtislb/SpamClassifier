An anonymous reader writes "A new device devised by Amsterdam graduate
student Melanie Rieback is designed to serve as a [0]portable firewall
for RFID tags. The portable battery-powered RFID Guardian uses an access
control list to filter RFID queries, blocking queries that aren't
approved. Rieback, who is also known for being the first researcher to

RFID Guardian to the public at cost."

the move is a "validation" of the central idea of Flickr: that photos in

Flickr's general manager. "People can take a picture and get immediate

"'The importance of this breakthrough cannot be overestimated,' said
Professor Stefan Decker, director of DERI. 'These results enable us to

The technology also allows us to combine information from the web, for
example the engine can list all partnerships of a company even if there
is no single web page that lists all of them.'"

Both have been problems because silicon absorbs too much light —

team added a diode to their laser which can harvest free electrons and
use them to help power the circuit — simultaneously cutting heat output

Rolgar writes "Cringely says that IBM has [0]begun massive layoffs in a
quiet manner, starting with 1300 employees, but by the end of the year,
the total will rise to at least 100,000 and probably closer to 150,000
employees, nearly 40% of their U.S. workforce. Some people will be
temporarily retained as contractors at a fraction of their salary, and
eventually, IBM will also dump many of the unprofitable customer
contracts worked on by Global Services or outsource the work to Asia. If
these people are looking for work, that could seriously drop wages for
technical workers in the US since they will have to compete with these
people for available jobs."

developers and those interested in the odd bits of history that
contribute to Windows' quirks. In a recent post, he talks about how an
error he committed led to the [1]recall of a Windows security patch."

paulraps writes "Almost a year after a police raid on the Pirate Bay's
servers, a Swedish prosecutor has announced that [0]he intends to press
charges against the individuals behind the file-sharing giant. They will
be prosecuted for various breaches of copyright law, reports The Local.
But a Pirate Bay spokesman was defiant, saying, 'I think they feel they
have to do it. It would look bad otherwise, since they had 20 to 30
police officers involved in the raid.'"

[0]Fahrvergnuugen writes "Wired is running a story about how an ex-lover
of the missing wife of accused spouse killer Hans Reiser has [1]confessed
to killing eight people unrelated to the case. While Reiser will still
stand trial for the murder, this development will undoubtedly complicate
things."

An anonymous reader writes "Robert Love who was the Chief Architect of
Novell's Linux Desktop has [0]resigned today. Robert is a prominent Linux
kernel hacker, author and journalist in the Linux community. His blog
doesn't specify why he resigned, but after colleague and friend Jeremy
Allison's departure from Novell in protest of the Microsoft-Novell deal,
this might be the latest fallout from it."
