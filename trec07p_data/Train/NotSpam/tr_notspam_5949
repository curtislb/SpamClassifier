<B>Coming up this Sunday on Reliable Sources:,</B>

<B>Politics and the Media</B>

John McCain officially announced his candidacy this week, but the media appears jaded on the man once hailed as a political maverick. Is it because he backs the war?  And Jon Stewart goes head to head with McCain, but was it comedy?

<B>DC Madam Scandal</B>

Deputy Secretary of State Randall Tobias resigned after confirming to ABC's Brian Ross that he had been a customer of Jeanne Palfrey's D.C. escort service.  Tobias says he was just getting massages, but Palfrey is currently under indictment for running a prostitution ring. Should ABC be broadcasting Palfrey's list of customers?

<B>War Stories</B>

When they broke, the Jessica Lynch and Pat Tillman stories seemed like made-for TV movies, but perhaps that's all they should have been.  How did the media get these two reports so wrong?  Is the wartime press falling down on the job?

<B>Plus,</B> Rosie O'Donnell is leaving the view.  Was her departure voluntary, or had she crossed the line with her vocal views?

<B>Join us this Sunday and every Sunday at 10am ET / 7am PT for our critical look at the media! ,</B>
