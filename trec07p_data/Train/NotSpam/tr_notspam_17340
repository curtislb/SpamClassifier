What's Up at the Centers for Disease Control?

The World's Leading Manufacturer of Airplane Fuselages

Our Favorite Airplane Stock

-----

Last week we were deluged by news and alerts about a developing "public
health emergency," as a 31-year-old lawyer from Atlanta infected with a
dangerous form of tuberculosis returned to the U.S. from Europe via
Canada.

The hue and cry centered on the fact that the man flew on commercial
airlines multiple times and thus risked infecting other passengers.

But I'm taking the side of the lawyer here.

Before he flew to Greece to get married, officials at the Center for
Disease Control told him he was not contagious.

If you had been told that, would you call off your wedding and honeymoon
in Europe and inconvenience all the guests who had made plans?  I think
not.

Regarding the return flight, the lawyer is criticized for not staying in
Rome after CDC officials informed him he had a drug-resistant form of
tuberculosis and should not fly on commercial airlines.  If you couldn't
afford to charter a private plane, and you still weren't coughing, would
you sit happily in Rome while diplomats dithered, and risk being stuck
there, perhaps to die, or would you do as Mr. Speaker did and privately
make your way back to your home country?  I know I'd try to get home,
thinking those officials were over-reacting, while trying to cover their
own derrieres.

And I think that's still what's going on today.

Now, I've had no experience with the Centers for Disease Control . . . at
least I don't think I have.  Approximately 30 years ago, I too tested
positive for tuberculosis.  I suspect I picked it up in Louisiana. 
Following detection, which came via a routine chest X-ray, I went through
a regime of simple treatments that may well have been paid for by the CDC.
 They lasted perhaps a year and I've been in fine health since.

So, I visited the web site of the Centers for Disease Control, where I
found this subhead: "Your Online Source for Credible Health Information"

I was hoping for something a little more proactive, like, "Making the
World Safer for All of Us" or "Keeping Americans Healthy for over 60
Years."  But no, all I get is an online source which, in addition to
up-to-date information on Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR
TB), includes "Tips on Health and Safety for Gardeners,"   
"Spotlight on Injuries from Fireworks" and "Older Adult Drivers: Fact
Sheet."

In short, while the CDC is the world's leading authority on dangerous
communicable diseases (a fact that I deeply appreciate), it seems to spend
a fair amount of time (and taxpayer money) on more prosaic matters.

A little digging reveals these facts.  The organization was established in
1946, tasked with carrying on the work of a wartime malaria control
agency.  So it was located in Atlanta, central to the malaria problem.  In
its first year, its budget was about $1 million.

Today, CDC employs some 15,000 people and has a budget of $8.2 billion.

That's a compound growth rate of  nearly 16% per year!

$2.0 billion goes to vaccines for children
$1.7 billion goes to fighting infectious diseases
$1.6 billion goes to fighting terrorism
$958 million goes to health promotion
$218 million goes to health information
$262 million goes to occupational safety and health

No doubt much of that money is well spent.  It's comforting to know that,
thanks to CDC's work, large-scale epidemics are extremely unlikely in this
country.  But there's also no doubt that some of that money is wasted. 
That's a given when you're dealing with a large government agency.

Interestingly, President Bush tried to cut the organization's budget by 2%
in 2007 from $8.4 billion to $8.2 billion.   (In Washington, that's known
as slashing).  Slated for elimination (among others) from the Health
Promotion Department were programs addressing Epilepsy, Lupus, Alzheimer's
Disease and Chronic Kidney Disease.  The reason: these programs had not
demonstrated health impact and were not focused on primary prevention.

But the budget ended up at $9 billion!  And the four programs mentioned
above remained intact.  So for 2008, Bush has proposed taking it down to
$8.8 billion, in part by eliminating funding for Anthrax research ($13.9
million) and reducing funding for state and local West Nile Virus programs
($16.9 million).  I think we know what the chances of that are!

And this brings me to a piece of news that received far less coverage than
the TB lawyer this week but in the long run may prove far more important.

In short, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation gave a $105 million grant to
the University of Washington to establish the Institute for Health Metrics
and Evaluation in Seattle.  That follows the gift of $50 million in 2005
to create the Health Metrics Network with the World Health Organization.

The question the Gates Foundation is trying to answer is simple.  Of all
the money being spent in public health programs around the globe, which
dollars are actually making the biggest difference . . . and which are
being wasted?

In business, we measure everything possible, and over time we learn to
pursue the most effective paths to our goals.

But in the world of public health, politics is often more powerful than
reason. And one of the reasons is that there's precious little data
documenting the effectiveness of these programs.

So I look forward to positive results from the Gates Foundation's efforts
over time.  Perhaps they'll even take a look at the CDC.

Now, after all this talk about health, I'd like to give you a great
medical stock.  But I don't have any; the sector is rather calm these
days.  Sure, some people say Pfizer is cheap, and I can't argue with that,
but I can't sink my teeth into it either.

So instead I'll skip back to the theme of airlines, where I have two
ideas.

The first is a little-known company named Spirit AeroSystems (SPR).   
It sounds like a new-age airline, but in reality it's the world's leading
manufacturer of airline structural assemblies like fuselages, nacelles,
thrust reversers, pylons, wings, etc.  And it's an American company,
located in Kansas!

So where did this company come from?  It was spun out of Boeing in 2005,
acquired by a Canadian investment firm named Onex, and it just came public
in October 2006.  Its biggest customer is Boeing, its second largest is
Airbus, and then there's the military, which pushes the envelope by asking
for structures that are radar absorbent and translucent.

I like Spirit for its dominance of this market.  And I like the market
because it's hot.  The greatest demand these days is coming from Asia, but
airlines all over the world, suddenly back in the black, are feeling a lot
freer about spending money.  Boeing's backlog is now $262 billion, and
every one of those planes uses structures and parts created by Spirit.

In the first quarter, Spirit's revenues grew 42% to $954 million, while
earnings grew 178% to $0.50 per share.  The after-tax profit margin was
7.3%.  And the stock looks cheap on two counts.  The PSR (price/sales
ratio) is just 0.7, while the PE (price/earnings) ratio is just 24.

As for the stock's action, after coming public at 26 last October, the
stock climbed to 34 in December, and then returned to 27 to build a double
bottom.  That set the stage for the current advance, which saw the stock
break out into new high ground in May.  That's good, but it's not much
better than the broad market.  So while Spirit has been featured in the
Cabot Market Letter, it's not part of its regularly followed portfolio.

Interestingly, if you look into the company's recent news, you see that
last week six company insiders were selling large amounts of stock!

>From time to time I get inquiries from readers about insider selling, and
here is my stock answer.

"We like to say that there is only one reason for insider buying (a belief
that the stock will go up) but that there are many reasons for insider
selling, including a need to fund options purchases, a desire for
diversification, or a desire to buy the wife a second home.

In short, it's not a major red flag for us.  Far more important is the
action of the stock itself, which reflects the opinions of all investors
involved - most of whom know about the insider selling."

In the case of Spirit, the insider selling follows the May 22 divestiture
by Onex of half its interest in Spirit.  After the sale, Onex still owns
one-fourth of the company.  So without even digging into the particulars,
it's obvious that the simultaneous selling by six insiders is related to
either the recent divestiture or last year's IPO.

As I said, there are many legitimate - and untroubling - reasons for
insider selling.

We do like the fact that Spirit is liquid, with average daily trading
volume of over a million shares.  And we like the message the chart is
sending - that it has the potential to run higher.  We just don't see
enough sponsorship in the stock today to convince us that it's going to
make a big move anytime soon.  But we'll be keeping an eye on it.

My second idea is also in the airline industry, and I can't tell you the
name of this company because we just added it to the Model Portfolio of
the Cabot Market Letter this week, and it wouldn't be fair to paying
subscribers to spread this news to outsiders so soon.

What I can tell you is that this company is in the business of furnishing
airplane interiors.  From seats to entertainment systems, coffee pots to
oxygen delivery systems, food trolleys to lighting systems, this company
does it all.

And business is booming, as the company works to outfit not just all the
new planes being built but also to retrofit older planes.  While the Asian
airlines are buying lots of new planes, the American and European airlines
are spending a lot of money on refurbishing.

The result is accelerating growth of both revenues and earnings, and the
highest profit margins in years.  This stock, like Spirit, trades over a
million shares a day, and it's strong, hitting new highs with great
regularity.
