you are absolutely right.

Volker, this seems to have been broken by r21303 in Samba3. Can you
remember why you removed the 
   tdb->locked[h].count = 0;
line in that commit? Without that line the tdb still thinks the tdb is
locked after a transaction cancel.

I know the code has to change, as lockrecs is now dynamic, but I think
we need something equivalent there. Perhaps we can just deleting the
list? You are not allowed to start a transaction when locks are held,
so we should be able to wipe the lock list when the transaction is
cancelled.

Cheers, Tridge
