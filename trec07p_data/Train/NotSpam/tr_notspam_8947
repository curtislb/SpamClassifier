Lou Dobbs Tonight
Wednesday, May 9, 2007

Tonight, outrage from presidential candidate Mitt Romney’s camp
over Reverend Al Sharpton’s remarks about God and his Mormon
faith. Why would the good Reverend invoke religion into this
debate – are we not a secular democracy? We’ll have the latest
on this uproar tonight.

Lou’s out with a new commentary today: The nation’s religious
leaders seem hell-bent on ignoring the separation of church and
state on a variety of politically charged issues.

Visit http://cnn.com/loudobbstonight to read Lou’s
comments on the dangerous narrowing separation of church and
state.	

The first faith-based sanctuary movement in two decades were
introduced at news conferences in Los Angeles, New York, and
San Diego. The churches are offering to serve as homes for
illegal aliens. Leaders of the “New Sanctuary Movement” say
their goals are to highlight the need for more “humane”
immigration laws, and to put an end to ICE raids. Will these
churches face consequences for their actions? We’ll have that
story tonight.

And we’ll report tonight on the five New York City churches
joining the movement to provide sanctuary to illegal aliens who
are facing deportation.

Senate Democrats held a press conference today to discuss their
amnesty agenda in Washington. Senators Harry Reid, Ted Kennedy,
Ken Salazar, and Robert Menendez continued to discuss amnesty
ahead of Monday’s debate on the Senate floor.

And Lou will be joined tonight by Rev. Derrick Harkins of
Christians for Comprehensive Immigration Reform. They'll
discuss why evangelical groups such as his are demanding
amnesty for millions of illegal aliens in this country.

Lou Dobbs lays out his manifesto to save the middle class in
his new book, “War on the Middle Class: How the Government, Big
Business, and Special Interest Groups Are Waging War on the
American Dream and How to Fight Back.” War on the Middle Class
is now on sale in bookstores near you and on Amazon.com and
BarnesandNoble.com.
