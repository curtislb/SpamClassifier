1. Employer Identification Numbers

If you already have an Employer Identification Number http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=98350,00.html you may need to get a new one http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=98011,00.html  if either the organization or ownership of your business changes. http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=99903,00.html . If you incorporate a sole proprietorship or form a partnership, you must get a new EIN.

2. How Long Do You Need to Keep Records?

Recordkeeping is more than just paperwork. You need good records to monitor the progress of your business, keep track of deductible expenses, prepare tax returns, and support the items you report on tax returns.

Generally, you must keep records that support income or deductions on a tax return until the period of limitations for that return runs out. 

Keep records relating to assets until the period of limitations expires for the year you report the sale or disposition of the property.
