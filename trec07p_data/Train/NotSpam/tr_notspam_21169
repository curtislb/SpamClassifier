use Cwd;

my $pwd = cwd;

You are populating @filedir with all entries ending in 'ctt', including those 
that are *not* subdirectories.

>      opendir ($filedir) || die  "can't \n";

perldoc -f opendir

You need a directory handle (same as open() needs a filehandle.)  You should 
also include the $! variable in the error message so you know *why* it failed.


>       my @f = <mlc*>;

You are populating @f with all entries beginning in 'mlc' in the *current* 
*directory*, not in the $filedir directory.


>       foreach my $f(@f) {
>    open (IN,"$f") or die "$!\n";

perldoc -q quoting

You are trying to open the file $f in the *current* *directory*, not in the 
$filedir directory.


>    print "$f\n";
>    my @a2= (<IN>);
>   ...

You *may* want someting like this (UNTESTED):

#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

use Cwd;

my $pwd = cwd;

for my $filedir ( grep -d, <*ctt> ) {
     for my $f ( grep -f, <$filedir/mlc*> ) {
         open my $IN, '<', $f or die "Cannot open '$f' $!\n";
         print "$f\n";
         my @a2 = <$IN>;
         ...
