Yes, you could indeed use it for producing essays. You can use it to produce 
whatever you want, and have complete control over the formatting. I would 
think that it's most constructive use would be in the preparation of 
scientific documents, which is the purpose for which I use it, but there is 
no reason why written essays shouldn't be prepared in LaTeX.
  You will need to decide on an editor in which to write the LaTeX, and get 
things set up so that you can compile in to your prefered format. Under 
linux Emacspeak is fine for an editor, and there are many shortcuts to 
aleviate the typing of what can be fairly complicated expressions.
  If you google for learn latex, the first thing that comes up should be 
enough to get you started.
