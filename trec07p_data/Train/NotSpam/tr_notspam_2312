I understand that. But I think it is sufficient if you uniquely
describe the logos involved. There is no need to talk about endorsement.

"The sign X, registered as a trademark under number $NUM in $REGION,..."

When you describe what the mark covers, you also describe what
the mark does not cover. If three years later your mark has
expanded to cover new things, this license will limit you.

I'm just trying to ensure you don't run into problems later on.
