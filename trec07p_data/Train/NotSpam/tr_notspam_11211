An anonymous reader alerts us to the [0]IndieHIG Wiki, which is an
independent effort to pick up the ball that Apple has dropped on human
interface guidelines (can you spell [1]FTFF?). From the wiki: "The
IndieHIG project is an initiative created out of the necessity to
document the new look and feel aspects of the Mac OS X experience,
outside of the supervision of Apple itself. The project is not intended
to replace, but rather to supplement the somewhat dated Apple Human
Interface Guidelines (HIG). There are many instances of Apple using new
and experimental interface styles, spurring developers to emulate these
styles in their own applications. Unfortunately, because Apple provides
neither guidelines nor code for developers to work with, the
implementation of these interface styles and features by third parties
can be lopsided and directionless. The IndieHIG intends to change this by
providing a comprehensive set of guidelines governing the use and
appearance of new, undocumented interface elements so that their
implementation by third party developers adheres to the unwritten
standards that Apple has set."

the security researcher who ran that very ad on Google for 6 months,

[0]Hylas sends us to Democracy Now for a [1]newscast on the missing
emails, an interview with investigative journalist Greg Palast. Here's
Palast talking about the fired US attorney from New Mexico, David
Iglesias: "Iglesias believes the real reasons for the firings are in what
are called the missing emails, emails sent by the [White House political
advisor Karl] Rove team using Republican Party campaign computers, which
Rove claims can't be retrieved. But not all the missing emails are
missing. We have 500 of them. Apparently the Rove team misaddressed their
emails, and late one night they all ended up in our inboxes in our
offices in New York City." This story has had zero play in the US media;
it's been being carried on the BBC.

Galactic_grub writes "An experimental new type of memory that [0]uses
nanosecond pulses of electric current to push magnetic regions along a
wire could dramatically boost the capacity, speed and reliability of
storage devices. Magnetic domains are moved along a wire by pulses of
polarized current, and their location is read by fixed sensors arranged

researchers have found that super-fast pulses of electricity prevent the
domains from being obstructed by imperfections in the crystal."

copycat art. She requested that people send the retailer letters
concerning the issue, and in response [2]her original post was promptly
deleted. It is still ironically [3]available on Yahoo cache. In the end
it appears that the retailer had been duped by a rogue art dealer under
the title [4]"Wild Aspects and Panoramics LTD". However, Flickr seems to
have overstepped its bounds in deleting this post." This whole case
brings back up the messy issues surrounding content ownership in this
strange new world of a services based internet.

[0]coondoggie writes "Did you know you could lose as much as 66 pounds by
sweating on your PC? Well using the [1]Mayo Clinic's vertical workstation,
that just might be the weight loss wave of the future. The vertical
workstation is basically a desk mounted over a treadmill that lets office
workers to kill two birds with one stone — send emails, check invoices
and write reports and burn calories at the same time, say Professors
James Levine and Jennifer Miller of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,
Minnesota, who came up with the machine/desk. There are other things you
can try as well. For example, the FPGamerunner, a USB full-size treadmill
that works with any first-person shooter (FPS) game, has you covered.
Walking on the treadmill moves your character through the game.
Handlebars and buttons at the front of the $1,299 treadmill control your
direction and fire your weapons." This seems like a lot better idea than
me trying to collect Pokemon on an elliptical trainer which will no doubt
one day lead to a very embarrassing obituary.

hosting some of my Web sites, asking for logins to change the domain
settings. Even though I never provided any proof that the messages from
the Hotmail account were really coming from me (the address they all had

its parent star is a strange world of scorching hot ice, astronomers say.
The 22-Earth-mass planet has been known since 2004, but recent
observations of it passing in front of its parent star have allowed them
to learn much more about it. It appears to be made mostly of water, but
not in liquid form. The planet orbits so close to its parent star that
its surface is a broiling 300 C, keeping any water there in vapor form.
Beneath the atmosphere, the [1]water is even hotter, but is at such high
pressure because of the planet's large mass that it stays in a solid,
"hot ice" form."

[0]Andy Updegrove writes "By now you've probably read more than you want
to about Microsoft's announcement that it owns 235 patents underlying
leading open source software, including many opinions about whether
Microsoft's new assertions do, or don't, represent a real threat to
Linux, OpenOffice, and other OSS. To get to the bottom of the issue,
though, you have to take a deep dive into how patent cross licensing
works these days. When you do, you realize that patents [1]don't mean
what they used to, and have far more defensive than offensive value in
the marketplace today. It also becomes apparent that it really doesn't
matter whether Microsoft has valid patents or not, because so many other
companies do as well. Today, what companies worry about isn't asserting
their patents against other companies, but maintaining their freedom of
activity. In this case, the open source community can simply ride the
coattails of the major vendors, because Microsoft doesn't hold enough
cards to win the hand, much less the game." Relatedly The Register is
reporting that the author of the main report being used by Microsoft to
support their patent claims has come out [2]against Microsoft's
interpretation of his work and Jonathan Schwartz gives some free advice
to the [3]overly litigious.

holy_calamity writes to mention that New Scientist is revealing the truth
behind the '[0]26 most common climate myths' used to muddy the waters in
this ongoing heated debate. "Our planet's climate is anything but simple.
All kinds of factors influence it, from massive events on the Sun to the
growth of microscopic creatures in the oceans, and there are subtle
interactions between many of these factors. Yet despite all the
complexities, a firm and ever-growing body of evidence points to a clear
picture: the world is warming, this warming is due to human activity
increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and if emissions
continue unabated the warming will too, with increasingly serious
consequences."

[0]Ben Rothke writes "The goal of security metrics is to replace fear,
uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) with a more formalized and meaningful system
of measurement. The FUD factor is the very foundation upon which much of
information security is built, and the outcome is decades of meaningless
statistics and racks of snake oil products. Let's hope that Andrew
Jaquith succeeds, but in doing so, he is getting in the way of many
security hardware and software vendors whose revenue streams are built on
FUD." Read below for the rest of Ben's review.

An anonymous reader writes to tell us that recently Valve Software's Spie
Lombardi has stated his strong belief that [0]user created content is a
very important part of games in the near future. "'I would argue that
it's the biggest component those guys have to get over if they want
online to matter.' 'Half-Life 1 was okay as a multiplayer game and Team
Fortress Classic was really good, but Counter-Strike kicked both their
asses no question. And that came from a kid going to college in Canada
and another kid going to high school in New Jersey, who had our code and
thought it would be cool to play our game.'"

Mariner writes "The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals [0]denied
Roommates.com Safe Harbor status under the Communications Decency Act in
a lawsuit brought by the Fair Housing Councils of San Fernando Valley and
San Diego. Roommates.com was accused of helping landlords discriminate
against certain kinds of tenants due to a couple of questions on the
Roommates.com registration form: gender and sexual orientation. 'Though
it refused to rule on whether Roommates.com actually violated the Fair
Housing Act, the Court did find that it lost Section 230 immunity because
it required users to enter that information in order to proceed. As Judge
Alex Kozinski put it in his opinion, "if it is responsible, in whole or
in part, for creating or developing the information, it becomes a content
provider and is not entitled to CDA immunity."'"

markov_chain asks: "For a while I've been making coffee using home-ground
whole beans and [0]a standard drip maker. I settled on this method for
its simplicity and good taste, even after trying numerous other methods
(such as the French press, [1]gravity percolators, and pressure
percolators), each coupled with either pre-ground or whole beans. So far,
the fresh ground beans are the only factor that made a significant
difference in taste. However, when I recently spotted a [2]a site that
vaguely extols freshness, I began to wonder how much the freshness of the
beans themselves affects the quality. Normally I thought the whole beans
would retain the quality far longer, due to less surface area exposed to
air, but clearly there still must be a decline; worse yet, it is
difficult to gauge that decline since the sellers usually do not
advertise the age of the beans. I would now like to pose a few questions.
What is your preferred coffee-making method, and how does it compare to
other methods you've tried? What are your favorite beans?"
