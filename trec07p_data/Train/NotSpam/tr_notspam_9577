Yep, I'm stumped on what appears to be simple.

Would anyone care to explain the following?

sflinux themes # echo 500 | perl -ple 's|(\d)|length(9 x $1)|eg;'
500

essentially, (\d) should match just the '5' in 500. that puts $1 == the
literal 5. so you take length(9 x 5) which is nine repeated 5 times, and
the length of that is 5. That replaces the 5 with a ... 5?

Is my logic correct on this?

thanks,

- sf
