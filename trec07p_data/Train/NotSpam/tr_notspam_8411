Hi everybody,

Last week, Ard Boer of dutch independent music label RaRa Records [1] 
and Lopend Vuur[2] podcast co-host contacted us (Simuze[3]) if we were 
interested in joining his petition to allow for more flexible contracts 
by the Dutch music rights collecting society Buma/Stemra[4].

The current situation in the Netherlands is that by becoming a member of 
the collecting society you'll have to transfer all your exploitation 
rights exclusively to them. Any musician or composer that wants to get 
the money collected in their name has to become a member of this 
(actually on paper 2 organizations) organization or else they'll never 
will get this money. This rights collecting society has been granted the 
monopoly right to collect rights by the government. Basically this 
situation stinks and we want to see it changed:

We want to see more flexible contracts (= non-exclusive) for members of 
the rights collecting society which allows them to choose the conditions 
under which to release their own music and for instance use CC licenses 
for this.

So, off course we joined his effort and thus I'm sending this email to 
this list. Although there might not be so many dutch folks on this list, 
I would like ask the few available to go an sign the petition.

For all non-dutch people, it's a Dutch organization and it would be 
better for this cause to have loads of affected Dutch people sign it 
instead of loads of non-affected non-Dutch people.

Instead we would like to urge you to start your own petitions, in the 
hope that we can see a change in the contracts used by the rights 
collecting societies all over the world and that initiatives like the CC 
licenses can be used in conjuction with a rights collecting society 
membership.

You can find the petition here:

Please spread this message! Contact your Dutch friends, start your own 
initiatives and raise awarness!
