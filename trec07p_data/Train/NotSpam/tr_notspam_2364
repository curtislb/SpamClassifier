Sorry, the other way round, as in R the (Welch)unequal-variance t test is 
the default, so it makes no 'homogeneity of variance assumption'.  The 
Wilcoxon/Mann-Whitney test is sensitive to differences in shape, in rather 
complex ways, more so than t.test. (I've posted simulated comparisons here 
in the past.)

I don't think anyone is answering the question here.  If the distributions 
are identical in shape, the Wilcoxon/Mann-Whitney test is measuring 
differences in means, medians ... (they are all the same), and if they are 
not, it is not measuring differences in medians.

To test specifically for a difference in medians, you can do almost the 
same thing as the Welch two-sample t-test, but use estimates of the 
asympototic standard errors of the medians (for which you will need
density estimates at the medians).

But I can only see this as being worth doing where the median is of 
substantive interest (as it could just be for lifetime distributions), and 
statistical significance is of importance (rather than useful 
improvement).
