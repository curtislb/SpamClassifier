Hiya,
    I don't have access to a hardware speech synthesizer, and so was wondering what the options are for me to get a Debian install.  I know that Gentoo can run SSHD, and let me do the install manually with another machine, but Deebian doesn't seem to do this.
Does anybody have any advice?
Thanks,
Zack.
