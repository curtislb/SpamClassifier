BUSH APPROVAL AT 28 PERCENT: It's hard to say which is worse news for Republicans: that George W. Bush now has the
worst approval rating of an American president in a generation, or that he seems to be dragging every '08 Republican
presidential candidate down with him. But According to the new NEWSWEEK Poll, the public's approval of Bush has sunk to
28 percent, an all-time low for this president in our poll, and a point lower than Gallup recorded for his father at
Bush Sr.'s nadir. The last president to be this unpopular was Jimmy Carter who also scored a 28 percent approval in
1979. This remarkably low rating seems to be casting a dark shadow over the GOP's chances for victory in '08. The
NEWSWEEK Poll finds each of the leading Democratic contenders beating the Republican frontrunners in head-to-head
matchups. Newsweek: The Elephant in the Room http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18505030/site/newsweek/

FRANCE'S NEW PRESIDENT: [Nicolas Sarkozy is] a bit of an outsider, the first son of an immigrant to rise to the French
presidency in a country struggling to integrate second-generation immigrants, the grandson of a Sephardic Jew who
converted to Roman Catholicism in a country still riddled with anti-Semitism and a graduate of France's creaky state
university system in a country long governed by technocrats trained at a handful of small, elite "great schools."  He
has always been nakedly ambitious, pragmatic, calculating and not beyond betrayal to reach his goals. He is full of
nervous energy, often rocking on his toes when not at the center of attention — a habit that sometimes makes him look
taller than he is in photographs but otherwise draws attention to his small stature. New York Times: Sarkozy Wins the
Chance to Prove His Critics Wrong http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/07/world/europe/07winner.html

BOEHNER: IF NO CLEAR SUCCESS, MEMBERS WILL ASK, "WHAT'S PLAN B?" A key Republican House leader said Sunday that if
President Bush's current strategy in Iraq is not working by fall, members of Congress will demand to know what the
White House's next plan is. Rep. John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House minority leader, said the troop buildup had shown
some success and noted that it was not yet complete. But he embraced the idea of setting benchmarks for the Iraqi
government and requiring Bush to assess the Iraqis' progress on a monthly basis. "Over the course of the next three
months or four months, we'll have some idea how well the plan is working," Boehner told Chris Wallace on "Fox News
Sunday." "Early signs are indicating there is clearly some success on a number of fronts. But... by the time we get to
September, October, members are going to want to know how well this is working, and if it isn't, what's Plan B?" Los

LATEST ON SEARCH FOR "WAR CZAR": Now that the White House is searching for a "war czar," it begs the question of who
has been coordinating U.S. involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan the past four years. A team of West Wing players led by
national security adviser Stephen Hadley has tried to keep turf-conscious agencies marching in the same direction on
military, political and reconstruction fronts. A few Bush aides say privately, however, that the White House probably
should have recruited someone to oversee the war effort a year ago. Critics say the administration's job of
coordinating the war has never gone smooth enough or fast enough. And now two key members of the White House team
focused on the war are leaving. AP via Yahoo! News: White House searches for war czar

"WHAT WOULD $456 BILLION BUY?" While there is some disagreement on the idea of troop deadlines for US soldiers in Iraq,
all sides seem to be on board with the amount included in the bill to fund the war. Including the $124.2 billion bill,
the total cost of the Iraq war may reach $456 billion in September, according to the National Priorities Project, an
organization that tracks public spending. The amount got us wondering: What would $456 billion buy? Boston.com Photo

REPAIRED NOLA LEVEES MAY HAVE "SERIOUS FLAWS": Some of the most celebrated levee repairs by the Army Corps of Engineers
after Hurricane Katrina are already showing signs of serious flaws, a leading critic of the corps says. The critic,
Robert G. Bea, a professor of engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, said he encountered several areas
of concern on a tour in March. The most troubling, Dr. Bea said, was erosion on a levee by the Mississippi River Gulf
Outlet, a navigation canal that helped channel water into New Orleans during the storm. Breaches in that 13-mile levee
devastated communities in St. Bernard Parish, just east of New Orleans, and the rapid reconstruction of the barrier was
hailed as one of the corps' most significant rebuilding achievements in the months after the storm. New York Times:
Critic Says Levee Repairs Show Signs of Flaws http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/07/us/07levees.html

CLINTON CALLS KATRINA RESPONSE DISPLAY OF BUSH'S "INCOMPETENCE": Sen.	     Hillary Rodham Clinton criticized the Bush
administration's response to Hurricane Katrina and pledged Saturday to funnel more federal aid to the still-recovering
Gulf Coast if elected. Speaking to the National Conference of Black Mayors, Clinton and Sen. Sen. Barack Obama both
took President Bush to task, although Obama focused mostly on the Iraq war and Clinton on domestic issues. Clinton and
Obama are leading the pack in early polls measuring the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Clinton said
she was angered when she saw images of New Orleans residents on their rooftops, begging to be rescued from the
floodwaters that followed the August 2005 hurricane. She said Bush's response was a display of "incompetence." AP via

EARLY CA PRIMARY PUSHES GLOBAL WARMING, OTHER DOMESTIC ISSUES INTO SPOTLIGHT: In the months since California moved its
presidential primary to Feb. 5 from June, the major presidential campaigns have sought to measure how the early
nominating contests being held here and in about 20 other states that day will shape their tactical calculations: where
to travel, whom to hire, how to spend money. The primary calendar — and, potentially, the relative influence of the
states — is still very much in flux. Just this week, Florida voted to move its primary up to Jan. 29 in an effort to
ensure that it would play a vital role in the nominating process and that the candidates would pay attention to the
issues its residents deem important. Other states with important early roles, like Nevada and South Carolina, are also
hoping to draw attention to issues rooted in their regions or in the makeup of their populations. New York Times:
California Gains Clout With Earlier Primary http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/07/us/politics/07campaign.html

THE PITFALLS OF NEVADA CAMPAIGNING: The Strip dazzles like a giant fishing lure, dangling promises of easy money, sex,
and margaritas-by-the-yard inside grand hotels that make up America's most notorious adult theme park. It could also be
a potential minefield this campaign season for stressed-out candidates and their staff members, who must maneuver
through a difficult political landscape while resisting the temptations of Sin City. After all, the current governor,
Jim Gibbons, won election last year despite allegations during the heat of the campaign that the Mormon politician
shoved a casino cocktail waitress against a wall when she refused his sexual advances. Gibbons said he was just helping
her keep from falling. Yet candidates don't dare duck the state. Since Nevada brought forward its presidential caucuses
to next January, the Silver State has become one of the must-visit states for candidates hoping to secure an early
victory and gain momentum going into the Feb. 5 slew of primudles. Boston Globe: Resisting Sin City, candidates give in

WILL WHITE VOTERS GET BEHIND OBAMA? They watch him. They listen to him talk. Is he the kind of person they think he is?
The kind of black man? The stakes are oh so high. It's the presidency he's after, the breaking down of a historic
barrier. Can he transcend racial divisions? Is it safe to support him? Is he safe from harm while running for president
in a nation of such abiding racial tension? For Sen. Barack Obama's white supporters, this is the dialogue of race, the
parsing of perceptions and expectations as they watch their man campaign... If the United States is to elect its first
black president, it is white voters... who largely will make that choice. Though much has been made about whether Obama
is "black enough" for black voters, perhaps a more relevant question is this: Has the nation's white majority evolved
to a point where it can elect a black man as president? Washington Post: How Big a Stretch?
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/06/AR2007050601255.html

OBAMA "SOME KIND OF YOUTH MOJO THING GOING ON": When John Kerry sought the Democratic nomination in the last
presidential election, his biggest Iowa crowd before the state caucuses was about 1,500 people. At a University of Iowa
rally last month, Barack Obama drew 10,000 -- many of them students. The Illinois senator's candidacy has helped spark
a surge in campus activism that he has moved quickly to harness, establishing 300 college chapters and working with
students to organize many of his largest rallies. The ferment may be unparalleled since 1968, when young voters rallied
behind Senator Eugene McCarthy and his anti- Vietnam War platform, said David Rosenfeld, campus program director for
the Student Public Interest Research Group, which encourages campus activism. "It's a generation that was already
civically minded," Rosenfeld said, citing a series of close elections that have piqued student interest, debate over
Iraq and the growth of online technology. "Obama, who is charismatic and has some kind of youth mojo thing going on,
steps up, and the thing takes off." Bloomberg: Obama's `Youth Mojo' Sparks Student Activism, Fueling Campaign

OBAMA'S MYSPACER NO LONGER "AS STAUNCH A SUPPORTER": Joe Anthony, at the center of a raging debate over the role of
netroots volunteers in Barack Obama's presidential bid, said Sunday his once ardent support for him is shaken as a
result of the Obama campaign taking over the Obama MySpace page Anthony created. I am not as staunch a supporter like I
was in the beginning," he told me. Anthony is the 29-year-old Los Angeles paralegal who in November 2004 launched an
Obama page on MySpace, the social networking site, attracting 160,000 "friends." Last Wednesday, the Obama campaign,
wanting total control of the page, shut him down, replacing his content with official information from the campaign and
leaving in the wake a dispute over whether Anthony was fairly treated.	Chicago Sun-Times: Obama's MySpace fan: 'I'm
stressed' http://www.suntimes.com/news/sweet/374027,CST-NWS-sweet07.article

EDWARDS KEEPS THE FOCUS ON POVERTY: As he makes his second bid for the White House, the former senator from North
Carolina is sounding a clarion call of a sort not heard on the presidential campaign trail since Robert F. Kennedy's
run in 1968. A millworker's son who became a multimillionaire trial lawyer, Edwards brings to the subject a hard-edged
rhetoric and a host of proposals culled from the University of North Carolina's poverty center, which he started and
ran after his losing campaign for vice president in 2004. Advocates and researchers praise Edwards for focusing on an
issue they say too many have shied from over the years. Washington Post: On Poverty, Edwards Faces Old Hurdles
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/06/AR2007050601322.html

GIULIANI'S ABORTION STANCE "SHOULD NOT DISQUALIFY HIM": Two leading Republican lawmakers said yesterday that former New
York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's pro-choice stance on abortion should not disqualify him from becoming their party's
presidential nominee or from receiving the support of conservative voters. Making the comments were House Majority
Leader John A. Boehner of Ohio and Rep. Tom Tancredo of Colorado, one of Mr. Giuliani's rivals for the nomination. Sen.
Sam Brownback of Kansas, a social conservative also running for the party's nomination, said during the Republican
presidential debate last week that he could accept a candidate with differing views on abortion. "I think it's an
uphill fight on that issue," Mr. Boehner said during an appearance on "Fox News Sunday." "But I think a lot of
Republican voters see Rudy Giuliani as competent and able to do the job." Washington Times: Pro-choice Giuliani called
acceptable http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20070506-104026-1594r.htm

HOW DANGEROUS IS DIVORCE? Rudolph W. Giuliani's first inauguration as mayor here was a family affair. His 7-year-old
son, Andrew, mugged for the cameras as Papa Rudy toasted his television hostess wife, Donna, as "my partner, my
inspiration and my lover." Then daughter Caroline, 4, hid behind her hat as the couple kissed that Jan. 2, 1994.
Thirteen years later, that familial unit is nowhere to be seen in the Giuliani presidential campaign. The once
rambunctious Andrew, now a burly Duke sophomore, has indicated that he has no plans to stump for his father — he's too
busy working on his golf game. Neither he nor Caroline, now poised to enter Harvard, are even mentioned on the
campaign's website, JoinRudy2008.com. And the woman shown now with Giuliani is not their mother, but wife No. 3,
nurse-by-training Judith Nathan Giuliani, who recently volunteered to New York tabloids that this was her third
marriage as well. Los Angeles Times: Private Giuliani tests public tolerance
http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-giuliani7may07,1,6553830.story

"POTENTIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST" FOR RUDY BUSINESSES: A pair of companies owned by Rudy Giuliani represented both a
debtor and a creditor in a recently concluded bankruptcy proceeding, a potential conflict of interest that wasn't
disclosed to the federal judge overseeing the case, records show. The matter could heighten pressures on Mr. Giuliani's
presidential campaign to be more forthcoming about the candidate's stable of businesses, their clients and the services
they provide. Wall Street Journal: Giuliani Firms Had Potential
Conflict of Interest http://tinyurl.com/ypo262

GINGRICH ON GOP DEBATE... "LUDICROUS": The Republican presidential field is matching records for crowded primary
debates, making it challenging for viewers to figure out which candidate is which - much less what each stands for. Ten
white men stood onstage last week at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California, and the same 10 are set to
meet next week in Columbia, S.C. Former Tennessee senator Fred Thompson and former House speaker Newt Gingrich, both
mulling candidacies, could push the total higher. "Ludicrous," Gingrich said of the debate. Candidates averaged "seven
minutes and 20 seconds apiece, split up into 25- to 30-second answers," he said Sunday on CBS' Face the Nation.
Republicans set a record with a 10-person debate in late 1995, according to Mitchell McKinney, a debates expert at the
University of Missouri. Ten Democrats attended a debate in fall 2003. USA Today: Crowded fields trim candidates' time
in debates http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20070507/a_debates07.art.htm

INSIDE THE "DRAFT BLOOMBERG" MOVEMENT: The national director of the Committee to Draft Michael Bloomberg is building a
network of volunteers to complement what would undoubtedly be a well-financed campaign for the White House, should the
mayor run for president. Joseph Oddo, a freelance writer, consultant, and five-time candidate for public office, has
signed up 100 volunteers in 20 states and hopes to eventually gather 1,000. The recruitment effort has been slow going,
but gains momentum with each mention of Mr. Bloomberg as a potential presidential candidate in the press, he said.
"It's a very basic start, but you set everything up in preparation," Mr. Oddo, who lives in Springfield, Va., said. Mr.
Bloomberg "could certainly bring a lot to the table for our cause." Bloomberg: How Mr. Oddo Is Seeking Draft Of Mr.
Bloomberg http://www.nysun.com/article/53901

CHOCOLATE, SODA, CIGARS AMONG CANDIDATE BAD HABITS: When The Associated Press asked the presidential candidates about
their bad habits, they did not fess up to anything that would sink the republic. John Edwards drinks his bad habit out
of a can or bottle - he is a voracious consumer of orange soda. Barack Obama is chewing nicotine gum these days to beat
his bad habit and chose something else to mention here. Joe Biden, known for being gabby, was a model of brevity on
this matter. But another candidate owned up to a talkative trait. Bill Richardson acknowledged what has been obvious at
various campaign functions: He has been eating what's in front of him, breaking from his regimen of protein shakes. AP
