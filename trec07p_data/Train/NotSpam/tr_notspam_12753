Thai AIDS patients suffer as drug squabble drags on

By Darren Schuettler

BANGKOK, May 22 (Reuters) - Each morning, Somying
waits on the canal near her Bangkok slum for the
iceboat that has become her lifeline.

"It's expensive but I need ice every day," the
33-year-old said of the 12 baht ($0.37) purchase that
keeps her lifesaving AIDS drug, Kaletra, from
perishing in hot season temperatures nearing 40
degrees centigrade (104 F)

A version that does not need refrigeration is
available in the United States, but not in Thailand
where the army-backed government is embroiled in a
patent dispute with its maker, U.S. pharmaceutical
giant Abbott Laboratories.

Abbott will not register the new version, Aluvia,
until Bangkok renounces its January decision to invoke
a compulsory licence under world trade rules which
allow governments to make or buy copycat versions of
drugs for public health measures.

Thailand, which has taken similar action on another
AIDS drug and a heart disease medicine in what it says
is a bid to widen access for its poor, wants Abbott to
cut its prices more.

The company is sticking to its last offer of $1,000
per patient a year, down from $2,200, but higher than
generic versions.

"The new pills would make it easier," said Somying,
whose monthly ice bill eats up nearly half the 800
baht she earns at home tying ribbons for a garland
maker.

"I wouldn't have to buy ice or carry around the cooler
anymore," she said outside the two-room shack she
shares with her two children, including a 13-year-old
son with AIDS.

Still, they are among the lucky ones.


WAITING FOR TREATMENT

Of the 8,000 Thais who need Kaletra, a so-called
second-line drug for people who develop resistance to
initial treatment, only 600 are receiving the drug --
and the older version at that.

Somying, who was forced to leave her cleaning job at a
sausage factory due to AIDS-related illnesses, still
pays 500 baht a month into an employee health plan to
receive Kaletra.

Without charitable donations, Somying, who lost her
husband to AIDS a decade ago, said her family would
not survive.

Her son, back in school six years after he walked out
when teachers tried to keep him away from other
children, receives the drug through the national
health scheme, which covers 80 percent of Thailand's
63 million people.

A former AIDS hotspot, Thailand has won praise for
reducing infections and expanding drug treatment to
100,000 of the 580,000 Thais living with AIDS. But it
now faces budget pressures as more people need
treatment, including expensive second-line drugs.

Somsit Tansuphaswadikul, a doctor at Bangkok's main
infectious disease hospital, said he has 30 patients
on Kaletra but could treat 70 more.

"There is a quota for second-line patients because of
the budget. Some patients may not get access because
it's not available, so they keep on with the old
regimen," he said.

The drug industry's defenders say Thailand, which is
spending $100 million on HIV-AIDS programmes this
year, is a middle-income nation that can afford higher
drug prices.

Bangkok says health care is already its second biggest
budget item after education, but it is worried about
the impact on trade relations with its major partner,
the United States.


"AXIS OF IP EVIL"

Health Minister Mongkol na Songkhla is in Washington
this week to meet trade officials who put Thailand on
a "priority watch list", citing a "weakening of
respect for patents" which could open the country to
trade retaliation.

"We only want access to drugs for people who have no
access.

We can't let them down," Mongkol told Reuters before
the trip he said was aimed at countering "bad
information" about his policy.

Mongkol, who acted after a coup ousted pro-business
Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra last year, said he
may target two more drugs, not the 20-30 some reports
have cited.

Mongkol has won support from health groups such as
Doctors Without Borders and former U.S. President Bill
Clinton, whose foundation brokers deals with generic
drug makers to provide lower-priced drugs for
developing nations.

"No company will live or die because of high price
premiums for AIDS drugs in middle-income countries,
but patients may,"

Clinton said in backing Thailand and Brazil, which has
followed Bangkok in overriding the patent on
Efavirenz, an AIDS drug made by U.S.-based Merck & Co
Inc.

Washington has urged the Thais and drug firms to
negotiate.

Its envoy in Bangkok has also criticised a campaign
waged by the lobby group USA for Innovation, which has
indirect links to the drug industry. It accuses
Bangkok of stealing American intellectual property for
military benefit and forming part of an "axis of IP
evil".

Thailand plans to hire a U.S. public relations firm to
counter the attacks, but some say the slanging match
should be replaced by a serious multilateral debate on
how to provide affordable medicines to the world's
poor.

"Drugs are not a tape or CD or something like that. We
need to think about the human right to receive
treatment. It's the same all over the world," Somsit
said.

Profits of gloom

SIMON MONTLAKE

Somying uncaps the plastic bottle and shakes three
orange pills  into
her hand. The branded lozenges are among the daily
regimen of drugs
that the 33-year-old takes to suppress the symptoms of
HIV/Aids, a
condition she has lived with for more than a decade.
She is one of
about half a million Thais infected with the virus.

A widow and mother of two children, Ms Somying lives
in a  two-room
shack by a canal on  the eastern fringe of the capital
Bangkok. Her
husband, from whom she contracted the disease, died
seven years ago,
leaving her to raise a son and daughter. Her son, 13,
is HIV
positive, and also takes  anti-retroviral drugs to
keep his condition
in check. Her daughter, 11, isn't infected.

Last year, Ms Somying - a pseudonym - fell sick, so
her  doctor
switched her to a new regimen. In March, she began
taking the branded
orange pill, Kaletra,  as part of her daily intake.
Every 12 hours,
she swallows three of the pills, which she keeps in an
icebox  in her
house, wrapped in a plastic bag and bundled with her
other
prescription medicines, as well as bottles of fizzy
orange and cola
for her children.

Since switching to the new drug, Ms Somying has gained
weight,
although at first she complained of nausea and sore
limbs. Now, she
has come to depend on the bottle of orange pills,
which she receives
for free every month under Thailand's national health
care scheme. Her
son has also switched to the drug, which he takes in
smaller doses.

"I've got no choice. I must take Kaletra," she said,
resting on a
straw mat outside her small house. "Life is valuable,
and we must keep
living it."

The orange pill is at the centre  of a global row over
the rights of
national governments to suspend patents in order to
source essential
medicines at cheaper prices. The dispute has thrust
Thailand's health
care system into the global spotlight and sparked a
war of words
between Thai Aids activists and US lobbyists for the
pharmaceutical
industry.

Last month, the administration of US President George
W. Bush took
Thailand to task for its failure  to protect US
intellectual property,
including registered drug patents, placing it on a
priority watch list
for piracy and counterfeiting. Although the move
doesn't automatically
trigger any trade sanctions,  US diplomats say it
underlines  their
widespread concerns that  the military-appointed Thai
government is
resorting to nationalist policies for short-term gain.
In recent
months, foreign investors have grumbled about
revisions to laws on
foreign shareholdings in Thai companies and the
bungled adoption of
short-term capital controls.

Produced by Abbott Laboratories, a Chicago-based
drugmaker, Kaletra is
a second-line HIV/Aids drug used to treat those like
Ms Somying who
become resistant to older anti-retroviral formulas.
Thai health
officials estimate about 10,000 HIV-positive patients
fall into that
category,  and the number is forecast to rise
dramatically in the next
few years as more Thais build up drug resistance. But
at an advertised
cost of US$2,200 per patient per year, Kaletra is
more expensive than
first-line  anti-retroviral drugs, which are available
as generic
cocktails.  About 90,000 Thais are on anti-retroviral
drug regimens.

Faced with a funding crunch, Thailand announced in
January that it
would issue a compulsory licence to source generic
copies of Kaletra.

It was the third such licence issued since November
under Thailand's
patent law and the provisions of the World Trade
Organisation for
public health exemptions to patent protection. The
other drugs are
Efavirenz, an Aids drug produced by Merck of the US,
and Plavix, a
cardiovascular drug from France's Sanofi-Aventis.

The response from the pharmaceutical industry was
outrage, as
companies criticised what they saw as a unilateral
and provocative
act by the Thai government. Attention also focused on
Thailand's
willingness to list  a blockbuster heart drug and its
hints that drugs
used to treat  other conditions such as diabetes and
cancer could
follow, if the government deemed it necessary  to keep
down its drugs
bill.

The alarm among pharmaceutical executives was
heightened earlier this
month  when Brazil announced it would also override
Merck's patent on
Efavirenz. Observers say the snowball effect of
Thailand's step, which
has the backing of Margaret Chan Fung Fu-chun,
director-general of the
World Health Organisation, is unpredictable and may
impact on drug
companies trying to expand sales in middle-income
countries.

"Already we have another country issuing a compulsory
licence. Is this
going to proliferate? And if it does, what does that
do to companies
that produce innovative drugs?" said Ashley Wills, a
former US
ambassador and trade representative for South Asia.
Western drugmakers
have tried to regain the upper hand by offering more
discounts on
medicines for the developing world, while insisting
that compulsory
licensing isn't the best way forward.

In February, Merck announced a 15 per cent price cut
on Efavirenz to
poor countries battling HIV/Aids epidemics, including
Thailand, and
trumpeted its generosity in cutting the price for the
second time in
less than a year. The drug is used to treat Aids
patients suffering
secondary infections or pregnant women, and is
prescribed as an
alternative to older first-line anti-retroviral drugs.

Spielas Cheung, managing director of Merck's Thailand
subsidiary, said
the company recognised Thailand's legal right to
override patents, but
was concerned that it would dampen spending on
discovering new drugs.

"Compulsory licences reduce  the incentives that
intellectual property
provides to invest in the research and development
needed to generate
innovative medicines and vaccines," he said.

That argument gets short shrift from advocates for
greater access  to
medicines in the developing world, who say
pharmaceutical companies
earn huge profits and can afford to cut costs further
for poor
countries. They argue that the threat of compulsory
licences is a
vital tool that governments need  to wield against
predatory pricing
by drugmakers.

"They're the most profitable industry in the world.
What more  do they
want?" asked Paul Cawthorne, a campaigner for Medecins
Sans
Frontieres.

Former US president Bill Clinton struck a similar note
last week when
his foundation announced that it had negotiated steep
discounts on
bulk purchases of Aids drugs for the developing world.

Standing next to Thai Health Minister Mongkol Na
Songkhla,  Mr Clinton
said he strongly supported the stance of Thailand and
Brazil in
issuing licences after "futile negotiations" with
patent holders. "No
company will live or  die because of high price
premiums for Aids
drugs in middle-income countries, but patients may,"
Mr Clinton said.

Although Merck has taken a conciliatory path, Abbott,
the manufacturer
of Kaletra, has tried  to play hardball against
Thailand. In a move
that upset some of its own shareholders, Abbott said
it would not sell
seven of its latest drugs in Thailand, including a
new, heat-resistant
form of Kaletra. Thai Aids activists said it was
unprecedented for a
company to withhold essential medicines, and launched
a consumer
boycott against Abbott products sold in Thailand.

Last month, Abbott backtracked and announced a cut in
the annual cost
of Kaletra to US$1,000 for several countries,
including Thailand. Thai
officials say this is  still too expensive,
particularly for the older
version that needs to  be refrigerated.

Vichai Chokevivat, a senior adviser to the Health
Ministry  and
chairman of its compulsory licensing committee, said a
decision would
be made by August on whether to buy generic copies
from Indian
manufacturers or order  more from Abbott.

Abbott is still holding back six other drugs that it
withdrew in
February, including new medicines to treat arthritis
and kidney
failure.

Despite the chilly relations, Dr Vichai insisted that
the door was
still open for further discussions with the company.
"We still
believe that we have a common goal with pharmaceutical
companies.
This  is to give patients a chance to get access to
drugs," he said.

As the row with Abbott rumbles on, Ms Somying's ice
bill continues to
mount. Every day, she buys three blocks of ice to keep
her orange
pills cool, as she doesn't have a fridge. This adds
360 baht (HK$85)
to her monthly outgoings, on an income of 2,300 baht
from a Buddhist
charity and making paper garlands for temples. The
new, heat-resistant
Kaletra, which has been available since 2005 in the
US, doesn't
require refrigeration, making it easier for poor
patients in countries
such as Thailand to stick to their regimen.

When Ms Somying makes her monthly trip to hospital, a
three-hour
journey by bus, she carries  an icebox so she doesn't
miss  her
morning dose of Kaletra. "It would be more convenient
to have the new
formula, but we don't  have a choice."
