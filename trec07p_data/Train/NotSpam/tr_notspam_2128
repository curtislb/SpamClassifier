That's an interpretation I've never heard before.
I'm not convinced that it would hold up in court...

The GNU GPL is perhaps the most notably and non-negligible example of
license having a meta-license[1] very different from itself.

[1] hereafter the term "meta-license" means license for a license text

The GNU GPL v2 starts up as follows:

|                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
|                       Version 2, June 1991
|
| Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
|     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
| Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
| of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
|
|                            Preamble
[...]

This is clearly structured as

 * title
 * version
 * copyright notice
 * meta-license (which clearly forbids modifications)
 * preamble
 * ...

Separately from this accompanying meta-license, the FSF has stated[2]
that you can modify the terms of the GNU GPL in order to create a
derived license.
But this grant of permission has a name-change requirement (which, BTW,
is DFSG-free, but GPL-incompatible!), some consistency requirements for
the instructions-for-use (I didn't think hard to check whether they meet
the DFSG) and a requirement to not mention GNU in those instructions
(mmmh, smells as non-free!).
Moreover, you _must_ purge the preamble: there's no permission to modify
it, in any way; there's not even the permission to keep it bundled with
your license derived from the GPL!

I'm afraid you then think that you have to purge every GPLv2 preamble
from Debian main.  As a consequence, you have to purge every GPLv2
licensed package from Debian main, since you cannot distribute a GPLv2
licensed work, without accompanying it with a copy of the GPLv2 text
(see GPLv2, section 1).  I'm not sure a Debian OS could survive this
kind of "cleaning" from GPL'd packages, at present: I would say it
cannot survive, since at least a toolchain for C and C++ is needed...=20

I'm afraid you need it, even though I would be much happier should I be
proved wrong!  ;-)
