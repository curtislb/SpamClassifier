Mongolia. The researchers had originally thought they had found the bones
of a tyrannosaur — the group of dinosaurs to which T. rex belongs — due
to their large size.'"

i_like_spam writes "Computer keyboards are a breeding ground for
bacteria. Studies have shown that keyboards often contain more bacteria
than toilet seats. Common cleaning methods, such as pressurized-air
canisters and damp rags, help remove some of the dirt, but they also
leave behind plenty of grime. National Public Radio describes a recent
experiment by a reporter who [0]used a dishwasher to clean her keyboard.
Following the advice on [1]Plastic Bugs, she placed her keyboard in the
top rack, didn't use the heated dry cycle, and air dried the keyboard for
a week afterwards. Her keyboard is now squeaky clean and functions
perfectly. Has anyone else tried this or any other alternate keyboards
cleaning methods? For those not willing to air dry for a week,
[2]dishwasher-safe keyboards are now available. Would you ever do this to
your peripheral? "

stjobe writes with the news that a group of US and Australian scientists
[0]successfully tested a supersonic scramjet engine in the Australian
Outback on Friday. The Sydney Morning Herald reports that a rocket
carrying the engine reached mach 10, and climbed to an altitude of 330
miles before the apparatus re-entered the Earth's atmosphere.
"Australia's Defense Science and Technology Organization (DSTO) said it
was believed to be the first time a scramjet had been ignited within the
Earth's atmosphere ... Scramjets are supersonic combustion engines that
use oxygen from the atmosphere for fuel, making them lighter and faster
than fuel carrying rockets. Scientists hope that one day a scramjet
aircraft fired into space could cut traveling time from Sydney to London
to as little as two hours."

consequences for the competitiveness of the US. 'The report identifies
six key questions that will represent the grand challenges that materials
science will face over the coming decade, the ones most likely to produce
the next revolution. But it also raises fears that those challenges will
be met by researchers outside of the US. It highlights the fact that
government funding has not kept up with the rising costs of research at
the same time that the corporate-funded research lab system has
collapsed. As a result, US scientific productivity has stagnated at a
time when funding and output are booming overseas.'"

the Neilsen ratings company's adaptation to it. But Glenn Derene at
Popular Mechanics argues that [0]users have officially pushed us into a
new era of television, wherein viewers now shape the way that networks
make money, which means we'll start to see users control the way the
networks choose programming. From the article: 'The systemic use of ad
ratings as one of the standard metrics for assessing viewership is a sea
change, and it's perhaps the sign that as an industry, broadcasters and
advertisers are sailing into uncharted waters.'"

most states, but it should be. Studies have shown that people who drive

releasing a device to [1]automatically detect drivers talking on their
cell phones. Instead of police officers needing to observe a cellphone in
use, the system automatically detects a cell phone call and records which
car was making the call." The article is fairly light on details, but it
would be interesting to see how the system differentiates from a driver
talking on a cell phone versus a mere passenger.

The QuikScat satellite used for predicting the intensity and path of
hurricanes could fail at any time (it's already past its designed
lifetime). Without this satellite, the accuracy of US forecasters'
predictions could be degraded by up to 16% — and there are no plans for
any replacement. Bill Proenza, director of the National Hurricane Center,
has been outspokenly critical of his superiors on this situation, but he
has been [0]warned to stop commenting on it.

thinks Microsoft's threats are ill-advised, and would like to actually

An anonymous reader writes to tell us about Yaman Salahi, a UC Berkeley
student and blogger, who lost a lawsuit brought against him by Lee
Kaplan, a journalist for FrontPageMag.com. Kaplan had sued Salahi in
California small claims court for tortious business interference and
libel, in response to a blog Salahi had set up about him called "[0]Lee
Kaplan Watch." Salahi lost in small claims court and then lost an
"appeal" — which is essentially a retrial by another small-claims judge.
No written opinion was offered with either decision, though [1]all other
court filings are available. From [2]Salahi's update on his blog:
"...because [Kaplan] sued me in small claims court, I did not have the
protections of the anti-SLAPP [Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Policy]
statute... I will never know why I lost the initial hearing, or why I
lost the appeal, because small claims judges are not obligated to release
written opinions with their rulings.... I will never have the opportunity
to take this to a real appellate court where my first amendment rights
might be protected."

operators are [1]unwilling to concede to Apple iPhone partnership demands.
Several operators went as far as to say they 'will never offer the
iPhone.' In the US, Verizon reportedly passed on the device, and AT&T is
rumored to have engaged in a revenue-sharing deal that includes monthly
payments to Cupertino." In Europe, unlike in the US, Apple has the option
of selling the iPhone through its own dealer network without a simlock.
