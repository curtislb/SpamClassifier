[0]Spamicles writes "The Senate Judiciary Committee voted Thursday to
[1]subpoena documents from the Bush Administration related to the
government's admitted eavesdropping on Americans' overseas emails and
phone calls without getting court approval. In a 13-3 vote, the Committee
decided to authorize its chairman to issue subpoenas for documents
related to the NSA warrantless surveillance program. Nearly any request
is going to be met with tough resistance from the White House, and the
confrontation over the documents 'could set the stage for a
constitutional showdown over the separation of powers.'"

An anonymous reader calls to our attention a blog post about the way the
[0]iPhone's multi-touch UI will strain the interface conventions of Web
2.0. This looming clash comes clearer as Apple releases more [1]details
of the iPhone's UI. Much has been made about the iPhone including Safari
to provide a full web browsing experience. But this reader is wondering
how compatible certain sites will be with the iPhone's input. From the
post: "[Web 2.0-style interaction] makes somewhat heavy use of 'onmouse'
events and cursor changes... along with CSS a:hover styles. The iPhone
challenges those particular Web 2.0 conventions, though, because it is a
device that not only adds support for another pointer, but at the same
time eliminates them as interface objects... [T]he user doesn't get to
express their attention with the iPhone... They only get to express their
immediate action." This reader asks, "What other pitfalls lurk in the
multi-touch web? Do any Slashdot readers plan to adjust their sites to
ensure they work with the iPhone, and can you think of any similar issues
that will crop up with such a different browsing experience?"

Vicissidude sends us to Wired for a look at a [0]fruit-harvesting robot
being developed in California. Its development has been funded entirely
by agricultural associations, concerned by the uncertainty surrounding
migrant immigrant labor. Quoting: "As if the debate over immigration and
guest worker programs wasn't complicated enough, now a couple of robots
are rolling into the middle of it. Vision Robotics, a San Diego company,
is working on a pair of robots that would trundle through orchards
plucking oranges, apples or other fruit from the trees. In a few years,
troops of these machines could perform the tedious and labor-intensive
task of fruit picking that currently employs thousands of migrant workers
each season."

officials are looking beyond Google in their examination of the impact
search engines have on privacy. Quoting: "A panel of European data
protection officials called the Article 29 Working Group decided
Wednesday to request information from Google's rivals amid concerns that
search engines are holding onto information about the people who use them
for too long, Hustinx said. Hustinx... declined to name the companies.
However, they are believed to include Yahoo Inc., Lycos Inc. and

[0]NewYorkCountryLawyer writes "A Washington woman sued by the RIAA has
[1]asked the Court to award her attorneys fees, after the record company
plaintiffs (Interscope Records, Capitol Records, SONY BMG, Atlantic
Recording, BMG Music, and Virgin Records) [2]dropped their case against
her after two years of litigation, in [3]Interscope v. Leadbetter. The
[4]brief submitted by her attorneys (pdf) pointed out the similarity
between Ms. Leadbetter's case and [5]Capitol v. Foster. In the Leadbetter
case, as well as Foster case, the RIAA sued the woman solely because she
had paid for an internet access account, and then later in the case
attempted to plead 'secondary liability' against her without any factual
basis for doing so. This tactic had been repudiated by Judge Lee R. West
in [6]Capitol v. Foster as 'marginal' and 'untested' in his [7]initial
decision awarding attorneys fees, and in his [8]later decision denying
the [9]RIAA's motion for reconsideration."

Apple's development team targets a feature-full build. The build that was
provided to developers during the World Wide Developers Conference
earlier this month is actually not totally feature frozen. Some minor
features are currently being finished for the system. These features will
arrive in the August build along with user-interface improvements,
sources told MacScoop. If you expect major 'wow' features or interface
changes, you will be disappointed. What we may expect is additional
settings and [some] user interface polish[ing]. Among the most criticized
parts of the new user interface [are] the new menu bar and Dock."

impending royalty rate increase that, if implemented, would lead to the
virtual shutdown of this country's Internet radio industry. In March, the
Copyright Royalty Board announced that it would raise royalties for
Internet broadcasters, moving them from a per-song rate to a per-listener
rate. The increase would be made retroactive to the beginning of 2006 and
would double over the next five years. Internet radio sites would be
charged per performance of a song. A "performance" is defined as the
streaming of one song to one listener; thus a station that has an average
audience of 500 listeners racks up 500 "performances" for each song it
plays."

Software has temporarily suspended plans to distribute Manhunt 2 for the
Wii or PlayStation platforms while it reviews its options with regard to
the recent decisions made by the British Board of Film Classification and
Entertainment Software Rating Board ... We continue to stand behind this
extraordinary game. We believe in freedom of creative expression, as well
as responsible marketing, both of which are essential to our business of
making great entertainment." Analysts have already started weighing in,
with some seeing this as [2]unfairly targeting the GTA-maker for previous
'sins'.

UltravioletLED writes "A company in Petaluma, California has developed
[0]highly programmable desktop lasers. The same devices used in hospitals
could also be used to [1]turn any metal surface black by simply changing
the software. From the article: 'The technology once filled a large room
at DARPA until Raydiance scientists made it into a compact, tabletop
unit. Schuler (The CEO) said he hopes it will replace just about any
cutting device you can think of, from a big metal saw to a precise
surgical blade ... Now that it's a little bigger than a breadbox,
researchers want to use them to kill tumors, identify friend or foe
during combat, and even remove tattoos.' Femtosecond lasers for eye
surgery have been around for years now, but these new lasers are far
smaller and promise to have much greater versatility."

News.com has the word that [0]congress is set to re-visit taxing virtual
goods, a concept they shelved a while back in order to consider the
matter more fully. That's given the Congress' Joint Economic Committee
time to come to a decision about what exactly the value of virtual goods
means for players and game-makers. An economist with the group told CNet
to expect their report sometime next month. "What that report will say is
unknown, as the committee has kept entirely quiet about its thoughts.
However, it's clear that something will happen. 'Given growth rates of 10
to 15 percent a month, the question is when, not if, Congress and IRS
start paying attention to these issues,' [senior economist Dan] Miller,
who is a fan of virtual worlds and economies, told CNET News.com in
December. 'So it is incumbent on us to set the terms and the debate so we
have a shaped tax policy toward virtual worlds and virtual economies in a
favorable way.'"
