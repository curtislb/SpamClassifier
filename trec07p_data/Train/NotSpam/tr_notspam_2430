Probably the easiest way to get gnome and orca running is to grab the 
latest ubuntu beta (7.04) and install it.  Orca works out of the box 
with this distro and most of the applications are accessible.  It even 
comes with the latest alpha of firefox3, so you can play with the 
accessibility features being developed.
