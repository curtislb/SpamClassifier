I just read the contents of 

  /usr/share/doc/bacula-director-sqlite/copyright

I have reproduced it below for debian-legal.  The Linking section,
which is needed for linking with OpenSSL, is not a problem for
GPL-compatibility.  The other parts may or may not be a problem, and
indeed seem superfluous, but all that is needed is the Linking
section.

Cheers,

For the most part, Bacula is licensed under the GPL version 2         
and any code that is Copyright Kern Sibbald and John Walker or
Copyright Kern Sibbald (after November 2004) with the GPL
indication is so licensed, but with the following four additions:

Linking: 
Bacula may be linked with any libraries permitted under the GPL,
or with any non-GPLed libraries, including OpenSSL, that are
required for its proper functioning, providing the source code of
those non-GPLed libraries is non-proprietary and freely
available to the public.

IP rights:
Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe
the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other
entity.  Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient
for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
intellectual property rights or otherwise.  As a condition to
exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each
Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other
intellectual property rights needed, if any.  For example, if a
third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to
distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to
acquire that license before distributing the Program.

Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

Code falling under the above conditions will be marked as follows:

Windows:
Certain source code used to build the Windows version of the Bacula
File daemon is copyrighted and or trademarked by Microsoft and may
contain Microsoft intellectual property (examples: Microsoft VC++, the
source to the VSS libraries, the Microsoft C runtime libraries).  As
such we cannot and do not distribute that software. We are permitted
however to distribute Bacula in binary form with the necessary Microsoft
libraries linked in.

You may obtain the parts that we cannot distribute as follows.  The
Microsoft compiler available for purchase, and Microsoft provides a free
version of the compiler.  The source code and libraries are available for
download from Microsoft public Web servers.  We have documented in the
src/win32 directory the URLs from which we obtained the library source, and
how we build the Windows File daemon and many users have succeeded in doing
so themselves.  Our intention is to respect as closely as possible Open
Source practices while maintaining full respect for proprietary and
copyrighted code.
