After cleaning up your workspace to keep only the objects that you will need
to have in your "package", you can save it as MyStuff.RData

save(list=ls(), file=file.path(my.package.dir, "MyStuff.RData"))

To use this "package" in future sessions all you need is

attach(file.path(my.package.dir, "MyStuff.RData"))

This will make your objects available in your current session without
cluttering your workspace.
Of course, there is a price to pay for simplicity (i.e. no error checks, no
documentation etc).
