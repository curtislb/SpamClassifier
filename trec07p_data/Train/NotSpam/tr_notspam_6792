I have an Averatec 3250, which has a Via Unichrome card.  The default
behavior of xorg is to use the "via" driver.  If your xorg.conf file has 
a "Device" section which says 

Driver "via"

then try adding a line

     Option "DisableIRQ"

before the end of that Device section and see if that helps.

On my machine the wired ethernet stops working under X without that 
option.  I remember reports that the wireless ethernet also had 
this problem on some Averatecs.
