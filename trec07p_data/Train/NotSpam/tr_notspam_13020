Is it necessary (or even fair) to tie compiler components to parrot?

Apparently this is an improvement over "invent the whole VM"? ;-)

I've been following parrot to some degree since day one, and at this point 
I am very much unconvinced that it has any real value.

I have always been more interested in perl 6 than parrot, and i don't 
really believe that parrot is essential, or even the best solution to get 
perl 6 going. 

I will follow this thread with some interest though.. perhaps my mind will be 
changed.

(Not that my opinion matters a whole lot.. At this point I really
have written perl 6 off too- it doesn't seem likely to reach maturity in 
time to regain much relevance for perl in the corporate world.. But that's
really a separate rant and it's not really parrot's fault, unless you
believe that parrot coders could be working on projects more directly
related to perl 6 instead.)
