Making news today...

* Congress sent a $120 billion war spending bill to the White House late Thursday, abandoning a call for most U.S.
troops to leave Iraq after an earlier veto by President Bush.

Full story on CNN.com: http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/05/24/iraq.funding/index.html

"War opponents dismissed the bill as a capitulation to Bush," but backers said the bill's provisions "represented an
assertion of congressional authority over the war that was unthinkable a few months ago." (Washington Post)

"[I]t postpones only until fall the next open battle between the Democratic-controlled Congress and Republican White
House - a time when Bush's hand may be even weaker." (Chicago Tribune)

* "Courting the anti-war constituency, Democratic presidential rivals Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama both
voted against legislation." (AP)

Clinton told CNN after the vote that "Nobody believes" claims that she and other Democrats do not support U.S. troops.


"I've been trying to get the administration to change course and engage in what I believe would be more effective
actions in Iraq, and they haven't done it," she said. "You know, at some point, you don't want to keep going on with
it." (CNN.com)

* The latest New York Times/CBS News poll finds:

"[T]here is broad support among Americans - Democrats, Republicans and independents alike - for the major provisions"
in the immigration bill before Congress.

"Americans now view the war in Iraq more negatively than at any time since the invasion more than four years ago."

"President Bush's approval ratings remain near the lowest of his more than six years in office. Thirty percent approve
of the job he is doing over all, while 63 percent disapprove."

* Will Al Gore run? "[T]he remaining Arctic and Antarctic ice could shrink to fill a cocktail shaker before even the
most skilled forensic psychologist (or screenwriter) figures out exactly how Gore is leaning on this matter." (Los
Angeles Times)

Political Hot Topics
(Today's top political stories from news organizations across the country)

CLINTON, OBAMA VOTE "NO": Courting the anti-war constituency, Democratic presidential rivals Hillary Rodham Clinton and
Barack Obama both voted against legislation that pays for the Iraq war but lacks a timeline for troop withdrawal. "I
fully support our troops" but the measure "fails to compel the president to give our troops a new strategy in Iraq,"
said Clinton, a New York senator. "Enough is enough," Obama, an Illinois senator, declared, adding that President Bush
should not get "a blank check to continue down this same, disastrous path." Their votes Thursday night continued a
shift in position for the two presidential hopefuls, both of whom began the year shunning a deadline for a troop
withdrawal. AP via Yahoo! News: Clinton, Obama vote 'no' on Iraq bill
http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070525/ap_on_el_pr/candidates_iraq

REMARKS "CLEAREST YET" ON BUSH VISION FOR U.S. ROLE IN IRAQ: President Bush said Thursday that once his troop buildup
improved security in the Iraqi capital, he intended to follow the withdrawal plan proposed by a bipartisan study group,
embracing recommendations previously spurned by the administration. Speaking at a White House news conference, Bush for
the first time adopted the blueprint outlined in December by the Iraq Study Group, saying he envisioned U.S. troops
gradually moving out of their combat role and into support and training functions. "You know, I would like to see us in
a different configuration at some point in time in Iraq," Bush said, referring to the study group by the names of its
co-chairmen, former Secretary of State James A. Baker III and former Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind). "The recommendations
of Baker-Hamilton appealed to me." Bush's remarks were the clearest yet on his vision for the long-term U.S. role in
Iraq. Los Angeles Times: Bush opens the door to a troop withdrawal

NYT POLL FINDS BROAD SUPPORT FOR IMMIGRATION BILL: As opponents from the right and left challenge an immigration bill
before Congress, there is broad support among Americans - Democrats, Republicans and independents alike - for the major
provisions in the legislation, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll. Taking a pragmatic view on a
divisive issue, a large majority of Americans want to change the immigration laws to allow illegal immigrants to gain
legal status and to create a new guest worker program to meet future labor demands, the poll found. At the same time,
Americans have mixed feelings about whether the recent wave of immigration has been beneficial to the country, the
survey found, and they are sharply divided over how open the United States should be to future immigrants. New York
Times: Immigration Bill Provisions Gain Wide Support in Poll http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/25/us/25poll.html

BUSH WILL SIGN MINIMUM WAGE HIKE: Congress handed a major victory to low-income workers on Thursday night by approving
the first increase in the federal minimum wage rate in a decade. By a vote of 348 to 73, the House approved the measure
as part of a deal on Iraq spending. Less than two hours later, the wage increase was approved in the Senate, where it
was combined with a bill providing more money for the Iraq war. That vote was 80 to 14. The measure would raise the
minimum wage to $7.25 an hour from $5.15 in three stages over two years. The bill includes $4.84 billion in tax breaks
for small businesses. They have made a case, supported by Republicans and the White House, that the wage increase would
be a burden for them. President Bush said he would sign the measure as part of the bigger spending package that had
been negotiated between Democratic lawmakers and the administration. New York Times: Congress Backs Rise in the Minimum
Wage http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/25/washington/25wage.html

HOUSE PASSES "BUNDLING" BILL: Under pressure to keep campaign promises to clean up Washington, House Democratic leaders
pushed through major reform legislation that will require greater disclosure of the links between lawmakers and
lobbyists. Chief among the reforms is a measure that requires lobbyists to disclose how much money they solicit from
friends and business associates on behalf of a candidate. The so-called "bundling" bill was steeply resisted by
pro-business Democrats and minority members who worried it would discourage lobbyists from helping to raise campaign
cash. In the end, the bundling measure passed 382-37, as House Democratic leaders managed to hold their own ranks and
draw plenty of support from Republicans anxious to burnish their own good-government credentials after a spate of
scandals helped oust the GOP from power last year. The Politico: Lobbying reform measures pass House

AG "NO CONFIDENCE" VOTE WILL GO FORWARD IN JUNE: The Senate will hold a vote of no-confidence on Attorney General
Alberto Gonzales in June, the sponsors of the measure announced Thursday. "Make no mistake about it: We are moving
forward," said Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), who is leading the effort. "When a situation becomes so serious that
there's a crisis in leadership of this magnitude, a Congress not only has the right to weigh in, we have a
responsibility to take action. And we will." Schumer added that he and Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Sheldon
Whitehouse (D-R.I.) secured a promise from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) that they would get a vote on
their measure following Senate action on the immigration bill. The Hill: Senate to hold Gonzales no-confidence vote in
June http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/senate-to-hold-gonzales-no-confidence-vote-in-june-2007-05-24.html

BUSH'S "TWILIGHT" "CHARM OFFENSIVE": The meal was fit for a queen: caviar, Dover sole almondine and spring lamb. The
setting was no less impressive: the upstairs residence of the White House, with its unrivaled vista of the National
Mall. "It's not Crawford," President George W. Bush told his guests, referring to the dusty central Texas town where he
owns a ranch. "But if you can't be in Texas, what a view!" As Representative Chet Edwards, a Texas Democrat, admired
the scenery, he said later, he was struck by his presence at the April 17 dinner -- his first such invitation from
Bush. Only 20 months before the end of his term, Bush has begun a cross-party charm offensive that many had expected at
the dawn rather than the twilight of his presidency. His aim is to make bipartisan progress on a few big issues -- such
as an overhaul of immigration laws -- before he leaves office. Bloomberg: Bush Launches Charm Offensive in Bid to Woo
Skeptical Democrats http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=washingtonstory&sid=akg7GXICOpys

HE WON'T RUN PHILLY, BUT HE STILL BECOMES "MAYOR": As expected, Rep. Robert Brady (D-Pa.) was officially tapped by
Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to head the House Administration Committee today. Brady's appointment to the post
follows the April 22 death of the panel's former chairwoman, Rep. Juanita Millender-McDonald (D-Calif.). In taking over
the committee, Brady - who earlier this month came in third in Philadelphia's mayoral primary - now becomes the
unofficial "mayor of Capitol Hill." His nomination by Pelosi to the post was approved by the Democratic Caucus at a
meeting Thursday morning. "Congressman Brady's experience as a leading member of the House Administration Committee and
his in-depth knowledge of the internal functions of the House will make him a powerful voice as Chairman," Pelosi said
in a release. "I know Congressman Brady will expand upon the efforts of Chairwoman Millender-McDonald to promote
equality and diversity on Capitol Hill." Roll Call: Brady Named Mayor - of Capitol Hill

MOST WOULD PREFER TO PICNIC WITH GIULIANI AND OBAMA: Rudy Giuliani and Barack Obama have won the picnic poll. Asked
whom they would most like to chat with at a Memorial Day picnic, Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, was picked
by 37 percent of all those polled when pitted against three other Republicans. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., got 27
percent. Obama, the Democratic senator from Illinois, was chosen by 33 percent when grouped with three other Democrats.
Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y., was second with 24 percent. Munching hot dogs with smaller groups of people would
be former Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C.; former Vice President Al Gore; former Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., and former GOP
Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. AP via Yahoo! News: Most would chat with Giuliani, Obama

CAMPAIGN HAS "NERVOUSLY AWAITED" TWO NEW CLINTON TOMES: Two new books on Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York offer
fresh and often critical portraits of the Democratic presidential candidate that depict a tortured relationship with
her husband and her past and challenge the image she has presented on the campaign trail. The Hillary Clinton who
emerges from the pages of the books comes across as a complicated, sometimes compromised figure who tolerated Bill
Clinton's brazen infidelity, pursued her policy and political goals with methodical drive, and occasionally skirted
along the edge of the truth along the way. The books portray her as alternately brilliant and controlling, ambitious
and victimized. The Clinton campaign has nervously awaited publication of the books for fear they would include a
bombshell revelation or, at the very least, revive memories of less-savory moments in the couple's rise to power.

MEMO MET WITH A SHRUG IN HAWKEYE STATE: News that a top campaign adviser to Democrat Hillary Clinton had suggested the
party's presidential frontrunner bypass campaigning in Iowa will likely echo as the New York senator returns to Iowa
today. But few party activists in Iowa or top national Clinton supporters sense any insurrection in the New York
senator's campaign. Nor do they expect her to reverse course in Iowa. "It causes some ripples for a while," said Sarah
Swisher, an Iowa City labor activist and vice chairwoman of the state Democratic Party. "Democratic activists would not
be pleased to hear Senator Clinton were really reducing her campaign in Iowa or eliminating it," Swisher said. "But I
don't think that's going to happen." Des Moines Register: Democrats shrug off Clinton adviser's memo

GORE'S NOT TRYING TO BE "COY OR GLIB." SERIOUSLY: Like an actor polished by constant interviews on a marathon movie
junket, vice president turned Hollywood darling Al Gore has mastered the art of (not) answering the most obvious
question: Is he running for president in 2008? "I'm not trying to be coy or glib in any way," he says coyly during an
interview this week in Beverly Hills. "I have no plans or intentions or expectations of running." Really? Are you sure?
You mean you'll never run again? Laurie David will become your adopted child if you do. He laughs and goes with the
thought. "Well, when you put it that way, I haven't completely ruled out the possibility of thinking about it sometime
in the future, but I don't expect to," he says, obviously spoofing all the answers he's given on the subject in recent
weeks. Los Angeles Times: Politics not his game, Gore says
http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-et-cause25may25,1,2559463.story

ROMNEY SAYS HE HAS RESPECT AND TOLERANCE FOR GAYS: Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney said Thursday that his
opposition to same-sex marriage should not be interpreted as intolerance of gays, who served in his administration when
he was Massachusetts governor. In a brief interview with The Associated Press, Romney elaborated on comments made
during a campaign event dubbed "Ask Mitt Anything" in which an audience member was concerned that the government could
prevent pastors from preaching that homosexuality is a sin. Romney said the government shouldn't tell pastors what they
can say. Afterward, Romney would not say whether he thought homosexuality was immoral. "I don't think that a person
who's running for a secular position as I am should talk about or engage in discussions of what they in their personal
faith or their personal beliefs is immoral or not immoral," the former governor said in the AP interview. AP via Yahoo!

PAUL TRYS TO ASSIGN RUDY SOME HOMEWORK: The fringe Republican presidential candidate who tried to blame the United
States for 9/11 during last week's GOP debate in South Carolina assigned Rudy Giuliani a reading list yesterday to
"prove" his case. Anti-war candidate Ron Paul claimed during the forum that U.S. foreign policy contributed to the
attacks. Giuliani snapped back that the comments were "extraordinary" and "absurd" - and urged the Texas congressman to
withdraw his statement. Paul yesterday suggested Giuliani read "Dying to Win," a book about suicide bombers;
"Blowback," which criticizes the unintended consequences of American foreign policy; and "Imperial Hubris," by Michael
Scheuer, formerly of the CIA. New York Post: POL THROWS '9/11' BOOK AT GIULIANI
