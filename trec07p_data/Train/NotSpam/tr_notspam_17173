Intent is not written on the paper.
It seemed obvious to me that this clause hinders binaries.
It seemed obvious to Florian Weimer that it rules out private changes.
So, I don't think it's obvious what the intent was.

In other words, this is an obvious lawyerbomb and we need further data.

Normal?  First?  Those imaginary English Language Meaning Norms don't
exist.  On the shelf behind me, I have ten dictionaries, and there's
more in the office across the landing and in my living room at home.

It doesn't matter whether one can support a view with a dictionary -
I've made that mistake in the past.  Is it ambiguous?  Yes.  Is it
clarified by licensor statements or case law?  I haven't found any.

It wouldn't be the first source-only-distribution licence I've seen, or
the first licence to rely on US-style Fair Use.

I repeat my pragmatic questions ignored so far: can we tell how this is
interpreted by the licensor?  Can we claim binaries are GPL by clause
6 or does the 'no permission is granted...' style of clause 7 overrule it?

Any more comments?  Please stop getting so personal and flamey.
