Hi Frank,

thanks!

> The second scenario is where I am stuck - Samba 4 PDC with Win2k3 BDC.

As stated in the release notes we have only very primitive access
checking...And that doesn't use ntSecurityDescriptor's yet...

I wonder why this happens, does this also happen with other network
operations?

Samba4 doesn't support replicating *to* windows servers yet,
it only has a very limited support for replication *from* windows servers...

If you would solve the above problem with the changing of the SPN
you would come to the next problem very fast. There's a lot more missing
until a windows DC would run in a domain that was created using samba4.
