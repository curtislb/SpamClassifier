CPANPLUS also knows about that and explicitely warns you, that if you
installed via a packager, this packager should also be used to uninstall.

If the user still wants CPANPLUS to uninstall, it uses the .packlist to
unlink the files in the distribution (that's what i would do if i were
to remove a module by hand).

That is an Uninstall, the module is gone afterwards. Mission accomplished.

All in all, this looks like a reasonable approach to me and i don't
think that CPANPLUS can be accused of lying.

Just my 2 cents worth,
