But herein lies the problem.  Saying ":vtable :method :anon" is just
like ":method :anon" doesn't make sense, because with this solution,
:method means something *different* when used with :vtable.  ":vtable"
adds a hidden vtable entry, ":vtable :method" adds a visible vtable
entry, ":method :anon" adds a hidden method, so what does ":vtable
:method :anon" do?  When used with :vtable, :method and :anon have
exactly opposite meanings, so who wins?  I don't know, and it doesn't
matter who does win, because it's not obvious to the user.  That is
why we can't use two opposite systems.

That's a good point.  However, requiring two flags instead of one for
the most common case is not worth the costs I've outlined above and in
my previous posts.

I ran a test through all code in the parrot repository, and was about
to publish my results, before I realized that vtable overriding with
:anon wasn't working.  I'll definitely fix this.
