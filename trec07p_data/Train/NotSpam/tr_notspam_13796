Court Ruling Could Have Chilling Effect On Organ Donations
Chris Halsne
KIRO 7 Eyewitness News Investigative Reporter

SEATTLE -- If you marked "organ donation" on your driver's license, you
may have given consent for something you can't imagine.

Over the past year, KIRO Team 7 Investigators have repeatedly exposed
how the King County Medical Examiner’s Office traded hundreds of human
brains to a research lab, collecting $1.5 million along the way. Dozens
of families say King County failed to get proper consent. Four sued.

Now, Investigative Reporter Chris Halsne discovers a resulting court
ruling might make everyone's donated body parts up for grabs.....
