I think the problem is that you are following a real mix of 
instructions, and they don't make sense.

It would be nice if folks would submit patches to the R Admin manual (or 
to the Rtools web site) rather than putting together web sites with 
advice that is bad from day one, and quickly gets worse when it is not 
updated.

R 2.4.1 is no longer current; the package building instructions in R 
2.5.0 have been simplified a bit.  You might want to try those.
