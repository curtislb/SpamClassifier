Hiya,
    The solution proposed by a member of this list hasn't worked for me...I still get spelling of everything by Espeak.  So...I was wondering what steps I would need to follow to recompile the kernel?  (I've recompiled the kernel before, certainly, in Gentoo.  I don't think they're too different...But do I just use the stuff in /usr/src/linux of my HD installation as is, or do I get another package with aptitude first?)
What option is it, exactly, that I need to change?  I'm not sure where I'd copy the kernel image when done, etc.
Thanks,
Zack.
