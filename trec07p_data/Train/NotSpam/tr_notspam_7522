I think Rodrick's idea is best. But if the
installation process doesn't let you specify an
installation directory, and if it doesn't document
where it's putting the binaries and config files, then
perhaps right after the install you could use the find
command in a manner such as the following:

# find / -xdev -ctime -1 

The output should help guide you as to what got
installed.
