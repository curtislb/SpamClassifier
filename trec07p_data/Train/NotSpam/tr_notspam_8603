Short answer: You have RHEL, put in a support call.

Medium answer: We cannot tell you much without know how you tried to
install perl 5.8.8.  RPM from a later version of RHEL?  Compiled from
source?

Long answer: If you have a valid backup, restore your system.  If you
don't then try reinstalling the original RPMs from RHEL and see if you
can get things up and running again.  Once you are up and running
download Perl 5.8.8 and install it into a different directory than the
stock version (/opt/perl5.8.8 for instance).  Change the code that is
using spamassassin to have #! lines that point to
/opt/perl5.8.8/bin/perl instead of /usr/bin/perl.  Or, you can upgrade
to RHEL5 which already has perl 5.8.8.
