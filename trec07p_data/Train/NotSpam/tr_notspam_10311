You are right, I should have weakened this sentence by "in most cases".
Tricky from you to cut out my next sentence, which was about additional
context that's needed in this cases and that your examples are missing
of course:

That would not happen in my code.
I consider having the same name for different things bad.
I even wouldn't do that _with_ sigils.

My way:
someref = &somemethod
object.someref()

Of course you could argue that you don't know in advance, if "object"
has a method with that name, so you cannot manually avoid the conflict.
But it should be no problem to put out a warning/error at runtime (or
maybe even at compile time) when a variable name clashes with a method name.
