R-ists

When you move from version to version of R a completely new directory tree is 
installed so in principal if you *know* that a package is not updated you can 
re-install it from the old tree or copy it to your new tree and install it.

Maybe an 'import packages from previous versions' could be included which 
would search  for other installations, offer a choice if >1 and automatically 
pick out the list of old packages again offering the user to check/uncheck 
each package.  Then the action would import or download updated versions as 
appropriate...

What would be more useful (and I don't really think this is the right list) is 
to have permissions and a date stamp attached to each object and to extend 
the ls() command to be able to select or sort on these aspects of an object, 
also the size - just like Unix in fact (perhaps with more comprehensive 
permissions although the group/world structures are not needed).

This is because as memory increases, I guess many people do what I do and 
create all their objects in the workspace - then forget when we wrote and 
when!
