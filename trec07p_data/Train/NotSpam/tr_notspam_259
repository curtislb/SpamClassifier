Maybe. That is in fact what I am wondering. However, an easier route
might be to try Rmpi with papply. Or snow (with either Rmpi or rpvm).
Or nws (a Linda implementation for R). Using Rmpi with papply, in
particular, is a piece of cake with embarrasingly parallel problems.
papply is like lapply, but parallelized, with built-in load-balancing,
although it will run sequentially when no MPI universe is available;
the later is very handy for debugging. snow also has parallelized,
load-balanced, versions of apply (though I do not think it
automatically switches to running sequentially).

All of these (Rmpi, papply, Rmpi, rpvm, nws) are R packages available
from CRAN. You will need some additional stuff (LAM/MPI for Rmpi ---or
mpich if you run windows---, PVM for rpvm, and Python and twisted for
nws).

(I asked about Rserve because the lack of fault tolerance of MPI is a
pain to deal with in my applications. Also, with LAM/MPI there are
limits on the number of slaves that can be handled by a lam daemon,
and that is a problem for some of our web-based applications. Thus, I
am looking at alternative approaches that might eliminate some of the
extra layers that MPI ---or PVM--- add. ).

HTH,

R.
