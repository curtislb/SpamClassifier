I almost never get spammed to the address I use for this list. Spammer's 
don't like to send to e-mail addresses that have certain words in them, 
and my address has them both.

Anyway, I must disagree with you when you say it's the list-manager's 
responsibility to protect you from spam. No, your mailbox is your 
responsibility.

Unsubscribing deleting the mailbox and resubscribing with a better 
address is the smart option.

There are several things you can do as part of your responsibility to 
protect your mailbox from spam:

1) Use a mailbox that's specifically set up to receive mail only from 
this list. It's filters would send any message that doesn't have 
"List-Id: <beginners.perl.org>" to the trash.

2) Subscribe with an e-mail address that spammers don't like to 
spam--like I do.

3) Use a mailreader that has better junk filters such as Mozilla 
Thunderbird. You can obtain it from here: http://www.mozilla.com/

4) Unsubscribe.

Whatever you do, you don't use an "exclusive e-mail address" to post to 
a publicly accessible mailing list that's archived on the web.
