Hello,
    I agree.  It is simply not going to work if it is forced into user 
space.  The fact I have a supported hardware synthesizer means that I'm able 
to read everything as it comes up, debug things that don't, etc.  I couldn't 
go back to even software speech, because with software speech you don't get 
that, and the reason is user space.  Speech-dispatcher and speechd-up and 
such are userspace programs, and so if the machine doesn't get to a point 
where they can launch we're dead in the water.  I for one am going to be 
attending a university in the fall, and don't look forward to having to ask 
a sighted person to tell me what the kernel panic says or how the FSCK is 
coming.
Please, if possible reconsider this decision.  It is extremely unproductive 
in the longterm.  Any problems Speakup may have building with 2.6.22 will be 
fixed in due course.
Thank you,
Zachary Kline.
