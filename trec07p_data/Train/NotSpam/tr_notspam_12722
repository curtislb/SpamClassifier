[0]prostoalex writes "Scientific American looks at [1]a new approach to
clearing networking jams, in research funded by the US military. Instead
of using routers to route the packets from point A and point B, thus
making some hop in the sequence critical for delivering the message,
researchers are exploring a new approach called 'network coding.' (Here
is the [2]illustration cited in the article.)" Quoting: "[Four
researchers] then at the University of Hong Kong published groundbreaking
work that introduced a new approach to distributing information across
shared networks. In... network coding, routers are replaced by coders,
which transmit evidence about messages instead of sending the messages
themselves. When receivers collect the evidence, they deduce the original
information from the assembled clues. Although this method may sound
counterintuitive, network coding, which is still under study, has the
potential to dramatically speed up and improve the reliability of all
manner of communications systems and may well spark the next revolution
in the field. Investigators are, of course, also exploring additional
avenues for improving efficiency; as far as we know, though, those other
approaches generally extend existing methods.'"

released some [0]details of their soon-to-be-available Linux machines.
Among the highlights: Only hardware that works with Linux is offered;
open-source drivers are used where possible; binary drivers for Intel

reasonable, but it's too bad that Click2Run isn't in Ubuntu 7.04 for the

direct2dell site divulges no details on [1]what models will be offered

useful improvements (better integration with Exchange and IM, limited

say "wow."' Palm already has at least one device with Windows Mobile (the
700w) and soon will make a big push to Linux devices, maybe by the end of

1990s, and is still used by many people who own Palm Pilots or Treos, is
going to quickly fade, it seems."

Reader Anonymous Coward the younger sends in a link to an article up at
Mises.org on the [0]market functions of piracy. The argument is that
turning a blind eye to piracy can be a cheap way for a company to give
away samples â€” one of the most time-proven tactics in marketing. The
article also suggests that pirates creating knock-offs might just be
offering companies market feedback that they ought to attend to.

[0]slashthedot sends us to High Productivity Computing Wire for a look at
the effort to [1]beef up computing and communications infrastructure at a
number of US universities in preparation for the data deluge anticipated
later this year from two experiments coming online at CERN. The collider
will smash protons together hoping to catch a glimpse of the subatomic
particles that are thought to have last been seen at the Big Bang. From
the article: "The world's largest science experiment, a physics
experiment designed to determine the nature of matter, will produce a
mountain of data. And because the world's physicists cannot move to the
mountain, an army of computer research scientists is preparing to move
the mountain to the physicists... The CERN collider will begin producing
data in November, and from the trillions of collisions of protons it will
generate 15 petabytes of data per year... [This] would be the equivalent
of all of the information in all of the university libraries in the
United States seven times over. It would be the equivalent of 22
Internets, or more than 1,000 Libraries of Congress. And there is no
search function."

then it was little girls, grandmothers, and dead people. But now our
friends at the RIAA are going decidedly low-tech. The LA Times reports
that [1]the RIAA wants royalties from radio stations. 70 years ago
Congress exempted radio stations from paying royalties to performers and
labels because radio helps sell music. But since the labels that make up
the RIAA are not getting the cash they desire through sales of CDs, and
since Internet and satellite broadcasters are forced to cough up cash to
their racket, now the RIAA wants terrestrial radio to pay up as well."

McCreesh, OpenOffice.org marketing project lead] added that while
Microsoft may not have plans to sue, it could be using the threat of
litigation to try to encourage corporate customers to move to those
open-source product vendors with whom it had signed licensing agreements,
such as Novell. "Microsoft has spent time and money accumulating patents.
Maybe it has started using that armory to move corporate customers to

An anonymous reader writes "Sunday night in the UK, the BBC broadcast an
alarmist Panorama news programme that suggested [0]wireless networking
might be damaging our health. Their evidence? Well, they admitted there
wasn't any, but they made liberal use of the word 'radiation', along with
scary graphics of pulsating wifi base stations. They rounded-up a handful
of worried scientists, but ignored the majority of those who believe wifi
is perfectly harmless. Some quotes from the BBC News website companion
piece: 'The radiation Wi-Fi emits is similar to that from mobile phone
masts ... children's skulls are thinner and still forming and tests have
shown they absorb more radiation than adults'. What's the science here?
Can skulls really 'absorb' EM radiation? The wifi signal is in the same
part of the EM spectrum as cellphones but it's not 'similar' to mobile
phone masts, is it? Isn't a phone mast several hundred/thousand times
stronger? Wasn't safety considered when they drew up the 802.11 specs?"

for business: broader access to online meetings with advanced features
such as TiVo-style playback, instant captioning of conversations â€” or
even translation into multiple languages. 'That technology could be a
foundation for companies to add improvements such as the ability to
identify the current speaker during a conference call ... He eventually
expects advanced features -- such as automatic transcription or
translation of conferences. Intel has used deals to advance its plans. A
February 2006 partnership with Skype included joint development to tailor
the service for Intel's dual-core chips, and free PC-based conferencing

Now that the news has been out for a few days and game journalists have
had a chance to chat with the folks at Blizzard, there are a number of
new stories detailing parts of the StarCraft II world. A massive [0]press
briefing about the game fills in a few more details on the game; only
three factions, no new races, the game is built with competitive play in
mind, and will run on both XP and Vista. For more nitty-gritty elements,
the company held panel discussions on the [1]art design and [2]gameplay
elements of the upcoming game. Video from the event is now widely
available as well; check out the [3]official trailer, some [4]example
gameplay, or the [5]epic 22-minute long developer walkthrough.

[0]NZheretic writes "According to APCmag, the [1]first cross-platform
OpenOffice.org virus â€” '[2]SB/Badbunny-A' â€” was emailed directly to
Sophos from the virus developers. The proof-of-concept virus affects
Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux systems and uses different methods on each.
It has not yet been seen in the wild. Despite Sun's OpenOffice.org
developer Malte Timmermann's [3]claims to the contrary, this kind of
embedded scripting attack represents a real threat to OpenOffice.org
users. Back in June 2000 when Sun first announced the open sourcing of
OpenOffice.org, the twelfth email to the open discussion list put forward
[4]a two-part solution for providing OpenOffice users with Safe(r)
Scripting using restricted-mode execution by default and access by signed
digital certificates. In October 2000 the issue of [5]treating security
as an 'add-on' feature rather than as a 'system property' was again
raised. Is it time to now introduce such measures to the OpenOffice.org
Core to greatly reduce any future risk from scripted infections?"

space_in_your_face writes "An international team has [0]broken a
long-standing record in an impressive feat of calculation. On March 6,
computer clusters from three institutions (the EPFL, the University of
Bonn, and NTT in Japan) reached the end of eleven months of strenuous
calculation, churning out the prime factors of a well-known,
hard-to-factor number â€” 2^1039 - 1 â€” that is 307 digits long." The lead
researcher believes "the writing is on the wall" for 1024-bit encryption.
"Last time, it took nine years for us to generalize from a special to a
non-special hard-to factor number (155 digits). I won't make predictions,
but let's just say it might be a good idea to stay tuned."

An anonymous reader writes "Choosing sides in the high-def format war
becomes that much harder today, as two powerhouse movie franchises hit
store shelves on opposing formats. Exclusive to Blu-ray are the first two
'Pirates of the Caribbean' flicks, while exclusive to HD DVD are two
different configurations of the 'Matrix' Trilogy. So which format wins
this battle? According to High-Def Digest, [0]this one's a draw. The
article has capsule reviews of the four releases ('The Ultimate Matrix
Collection' & 'The Complete Matrix Trilogy' on HD DVD, and 'POTC: Curse
of the Black Pearl' & 'POTC: Dead Man's Chest' on Blu-ray) with links to
excruciatingly in-depth reviews. In the end the site says both sets of
releases boast benchmark video and audio, but a preponderance of
standard-def supplements prevent all of the above from being the perfect
high-def package."

QCMBR writes "A [0]new Microsoft-funded study by a Harvard Business
School professor concludes that developers don't want extensive patent
licensing requirements in the GPL3. There are significant problems with
the study, however, especially given the very small sample size.
'Although 332 emails were sent to various developers, only 34 agreed to
participate in the survey â€” an 11 percent response rate. Of the 34
developers who responded, many of them are associated with projects like
Apache and PostgreSQL that don't even use the GPL.' Ars points out that
the GPL3 draft editing and review process is highly transparent and
inclusive 'to an extent that makes MacWarwick's claims of
under-representation seem difficult to accept given the small sample size
of the study and the number of respondents who contribute to non-GPL
projects.'"

than expected and lawmakers are concerned that millions of dollars will
have gone to waste that could have been better spent on roads or
crime-fighting. Satisfaction with the quality of service has also been
low, which give some insight into the low adoption rate. Is municipal
Wi-Fi just a bad idea, has it been poorly implemented, or is the
technology just not there to support such an endeavor?"

hereisnowhy writes "The rising demand for corn as a source of
ethanol-blended fuel is [0]largely to blame for increasing food costs
around the world, the CBC reports. Increased prices for ethanol have
already led to bigger grocery bills for the average American â€” an
increase of $47 US compared to July 2006. In Mexico last year, corn
tortillas, a crucial source of calories for 50 million poor people,
doubled in price; the increase forced the government to introduce price
controls. The move to ethanol-blended fuel is based in part on widespread
belief that it produces cleaner emissions than regular gasoline. But a
recent Environment Canada study found no statistical difference between
the greenhouse gas emissions of regular unleaded fuel and 10 per cent
ethanol-blended fuel. Environmental groups have argued that producing
ethanol â€” whether from corn, beets, wheat, or other crops â€” requires more
energy than can be derived from the product."

[0]leecidivo alerts us to Tom Keating's blog, where he writes about how
[1]Nortel forced a former subsidiary to return its open source-based
phone system (Fonality) after the subsidiary went public with how happy
they are with the Fonality phone system compared to Nortel. Quoting:
"What happens when a VoIP blog (yours truly) writes about the fact that a
former Nortel subsidiary (Blade Network Technologies) went looking for a
new phone system, chose an open-source Asterisk-based solution from
Fonality instead of using Nortel's own PBX and then agreed to go on
record on the VoIP & Gadgets blog about why they made such a shocking
decision? A) Nothing â€” it's a VoIP blog â€” who cares? Nortel is an $11
billion dollar company that certainly doesn't read blogs for their news.
B) Nortel reads the blog post, is a little peeved, but other than some
emails sent internally, no one outside Nortel would ever know they were
annoyed. C) A Nortel Board Member flips out over the article, contacts
Blade and then pressures Blade to return the Fonality system and have
Fonality print a retraction to the blog article (and the subsequent press
release)."

Moochman writes "New Scientist reports on a technology Microsoft is
developing to [0]identify users based on their browsing habits. Quote:
'The software could get its raw information from a number of sources,
including a new type of 'cookie' program that records the pages visited.
Alternatively, it could use your PC's own cache of web pages, or proxy
servers could maintain records of sites visited. So far it can only guess
gender and age with any accuracy,' but the aim is to be able to identify
name, occupation and location as well. On a related note, The Inquirer
reports on Microsoft's plans to [1]widen the use of its
identity-verification technology CardSpace, which is built into Windows
Vista and available as an add-on to XP. It's being envisioned as an
identity solution for the entire internet: says Kim Cameron, pioneer of
the technology, 'We feel it has to solve all use cases.' (Aha, so the
anonymous use cases, too, eh?) One might ask, with all of this user-ID
information on hand, how long will it be until the Feds come knocking on
Microsoft's door asking for help? [2]They [3]already [4]have."
