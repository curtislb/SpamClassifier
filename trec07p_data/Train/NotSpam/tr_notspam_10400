[emphasis added]

If that is in fact what was done, it obviously doesn't.

However, what is actually copyrighted is a specific representation of
a person in a wheelchair, and the creation of derivative works
thereof. It's not clear that all minimalistic representations of a
person in a wheelchair would be derivative works of the ISA.

CNN/Reuters: News reports have filtered out early this morning that US
forces have swooped on an Iraqi Primary School and detained 6th Grade 
teacher Mohammed Al-Hazar. Sources indicate that, when arrested,
Al-Hazar was in possession of a ruler, a protractor, a set square and
a calculator. US President George W Bush argued that this was clear
and overwhelming evidence that Iraq indeed possessed weapons of maths 
instruction.
