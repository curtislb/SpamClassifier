I'm not looking at it for any particular reason. My interest in
helping work on parrot began only yesterday. First I spent last night
reading a few pdds. Then this morning in an effort to familiarize
myself with the implementation details I opened up main.c and just
started reading line by line assuming hello.pasm as
input. Unfortunately Parrot_alloc_context() is the first non-trivial
code that one runs into when doing that. The call stack basically
goes:

main() ->
   Parrot_new() ->
     make_interpreter() ->
       create_initial_context() ->
         Parrot_alloc_context() ->
           walk_away_from_computer_in_confusion()

In that case I'll keep on digging. If I pinpoint the person who authored
the confusing bits then I'll forward him a link to this thread on
nntp.perl.org.
