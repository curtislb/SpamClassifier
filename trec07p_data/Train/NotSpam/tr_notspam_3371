I believe that both of these tests are currently being run with 
the -G flag, which should mean that Parrot is not doing any garbage 
collection:

    $ head -2 t/compilers/pge/p5regex/p5rx.t
    #!./parrot -G
    # Copyright (C) 2001-2006, The Perl Foundation.

    $ head -2 t/compilers/pge/p6regex/01-regex.t
    #!./parrot -G
    # Copyright (C) 2001-2007, The Perl Foundation.

Given the number of tests that run, I'm not too surprised 
that they run out of memory when -G is present.

This does prompt the question of removing -G from the tests, 
but the last time I looked into doing this (about a month ago) Parrot
still had intermittent GC errors that would cause random
failures in the tests.  After a lot of discussion on the mailing
list and in #parrot I think it was decided that running the 
tests with -G was preferable to having random test failures
showing up in the pge tests due to GC problems in Parrot.

Hope this helps, and thanks for the report!

(Should we close this ticket?)
