basically, i want to have access to a pendrive on sugar. with Xfe is very
easy, you plug the pendrive and there=B4s an option to mount it. u only nee=
d
to add a couple of lines in fstab, something like "/dev/sda1 /mnt/usb vfat
noauto, user 0 0", and that=B4s it.

besides, i=B4m trying to add other "traditional" applications, but i can=B4=
t
create activities for them. it seems that i=B4ll have to wait a little bit
for that..
i hope it=B4ll be ready soon.......;P
