Hello Gavin!

I thank you so much that you help me here.
Only to answer your questions there are 452 samples (species) in A=20=20
and the same number in B.
Unfortunately I will get the book from Legendre & Legendre only in 2=20=20
days (small library) but I think for the moment I am busy to try and=20=20
learn with the codes you gave me here.
For me it seems that this will solve all the problems I have at the=20=20
moment.
Now it is my turn to learn about it.

Once again: thanks

Greetings

Birgit
