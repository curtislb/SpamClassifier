Ivo,

I don't know whether you ever got a proper answer to this question.
Here is a kludgy one --  someone else can probably provide
a more elegant version of my diffid function.

What you want to do is sweep out the mean deviations from both y
and x based on the factor fe and then estimate the simple y on x  
linear model.

I have an old function that was originally designed to do panel data
models that looks like this:

"diffid" <- function(h, id)
{
         if(is.vector(h))
                 h <- matrix(h, ncol = 1)
         Ph <- unique(id)
         Ph <- cbind(Ph, table(id))
         for(i in 1:ncol(h))
                 Ph <- cbind(Ph, tapply(h[, i], id, mean))
         is <- tapply(id, id)
         Ph <- Ph[is,  - (1:2)]
         h - Ph
}

With this  you can do:

set.seed(1);
fe = as.factor( as.integer( runif(100)*10 ) ); y=rnorm(100); x=rnorm 
(100);
summary(lm(diffid(y,fe) ~ diffid(x,fe)))

HTH,

Roger
