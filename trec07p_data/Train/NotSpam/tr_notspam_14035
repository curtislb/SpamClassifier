Hi Mika,
I'm using the latest and greatest, version 1.0.
I have better success when speechd-up has a positive (low)
priority, rather than a negative one.
I think this is because a low priority process makes fewer reads to
/dev/softsynth, so it is more likely to read words, rather than single
characters.  You can actually view this with a packet capture tool,
reading incoming messages on port 6560 (used by speech-dispatcher).
When speechd-up runs with priority <= 0, I see a speak message
generated and sent to speech-dispatcher for every character in a word,
but when it runs with priority > 0, it usually sends a speak message
to dispatcher containing a whole word or line of text.  I really don't
have an explanation for this, especially considering that other people
are not encountering the same behavior that I am!
I think the solution lies in modifying the speechd-up sources to use
a different buffering strategy, rather than recompiling kernels and
changing process priorities...
