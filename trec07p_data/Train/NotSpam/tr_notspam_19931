There is Shane's netinst cd for debian with speakup, which I believe
could be used as a rescue cd as well.

I think I found those here
http://people.debian.org/~shane/speakup/kernel/

I'm working with an ARM based development board which uses
debian as the core of its specialized distro, and I keep intending
to switch to debian on pc, but I can't tear myself away from 
slackware it seems.
