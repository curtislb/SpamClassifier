I've finished a full review, and only added a few more items to the list 
of tasks. It's now down to 126 failing tests. I'm working on taking more 
out.

A question for compiler and PIR tool writers before I change the 
code/tests for one feature: the current design decision is that class 
objects always return a 'typeof' Class, while objects instantiated from 
the class return a 'typeof' the class name. So:

   $P0 = newclass "Foo"
   $S0 = typeof $P0 # returns "Class"

   $P1 = new $P0
   $S1 = typeof $P1 # returns "Foo"

This is different than the old object model, which would return "Foo" 
for both the class object and the instantiated object.

The new way seems saner, but which is more useful? You can always figure 
out if you have a class or an object by calling 'isa' for Class or Object.
