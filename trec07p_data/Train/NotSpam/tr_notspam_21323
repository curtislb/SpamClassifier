Fortunately Larry has found a way in which literal strings will still
work as you (and your students) expect.

Well the new is simpler.

I agree with that.

I also think that this particular change is worth the risk of a learner
putting an assignment at the start of a line, especially given:

* With the exception for literal strings, this now pretty much only
  applies to assignment.

* Because the C<=> has to be followed immediately by the Pod directive,
  any C<=>s with space after them or assigning a quoted string will be
  immune; only those assigning the return values of functions will be
  affected.

That's slim.  Even allowing for Sod's Law I would happily lead a
beginners' Perl course and chance not mentioning this exception
