<strong>'Raw Politics' tonight: Pressure on Gonzales, deal on immigration, speculation on Gore</strong>

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Everyone in Washington knows the rule: Always kick a man when he's down, because he can't kick back. And congressional Democrats are kicking Attorney General Alberto Gonzales very hard, CNN's Tom Foreman reports in tonight's "Raw Politics."

Meanwhile, more than ten million illegal immigrants may get a way "in." A bipartisan plan has been worked out to allow illegal immigrants to earn citizenship. The measure faces debate in Congress this summer.

And will voters face Al Gore's name on the ballot in '08?

<em>Catch it all on "Raw Politics," tonight on Anderson Cooper 360, 10 p.m. ET</em>
