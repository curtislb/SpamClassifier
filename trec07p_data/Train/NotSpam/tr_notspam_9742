That happens because the match variables ($1, $2, ...) are only changed 
when a regular expression matches; otherwise, they are left alone.

In the first case, "$2 !~ /domain\.com/" succeeds but does not capture 
anything, so the numbered match variables are unset.

Your situation reinforces the rule that you should always test if the 
match succeeded before you attempt to use the match variables:

     my $email = 'steveb@domain.com';
     my @f = (undef, $email =~ /(.*)\@(.*)/);

     (@f > 1) && ($f[2] =~ /domain\.com/ ?
         print "$f[1]\n" : print "var 2 is bad\n" );

The test "@f > 1" is my way of testing if the match succeeded.
