Essentially the way we're handling it now is with allowing the bands
to handle a lot of the monetizing themselves. We release the music
ourselves through multitude venues (local stores which play the music
and give away or sell CDs, priority radio time set aside for free
music by college stations, distributed through our website and on
other review sites) and promote and hold shows for the bands under our
label. We have a small amount of seed money from successful shows
we've had and initial funding that I and a few others have provided.
With that we're pressing limited runs of vinyl and cd-rs to give to
the band for free. in turn, the band sells them at their shows and on
their website and keeps all of the money from any sales with no
obligation to pay us back. If they'd like more materials, we're happy
to order them, and this is just the first sort of experiment in how to
fund the creation of free music.

The studio time is donated to us by college radio stations (they
obviously have a vested interest, both in charter and
self-preservation, in 'funding' free content) and the production is
taken care of by the recording artist, a tech at the station, or an
independent producer/company that has donated us time.

We've been able to involve /a lot/ of larger named bands, partially as
we're curating music to be distributed with the first shipments of
OLPCs as part of their free content packages.

Christopher (typically a lurker)
