Hello everybody,

We are a small group of people that are working to publish an art
magazine on the internet. We plan to deliver it for free in .pdf
format, under the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No
Derivative Works 3.0 License. The magazine will include articles
submitted by the readers and we've chosen CC so that the respective
authors may keep the copyright of their work after publication. The
license is mentioned during the submission process that they must
follow in order to send us their articles so we can make sure that
they read it. However, we still have two questions:

1. Do we need to ask them to sign an agreement in paper to get assured
they really took knowledge of the License terms? (as I read in the FAQ
on the website, "you can only secure this kind of permission if you
are in direct contact with the person, discuss Creative Commons
licensing with them and they agree to a specific license;").
Would it be enough for example to simply state on our website
something like "in the moment a submission is received, it is implicit
that the authors took knowledge of the terms specified by the license
and agree with them?"

2. As I mentioned before, the magazine will be available for free
download. However we plan to publish other special issues for selling
them on the website. We also want to reuse the content of the website
itself (but not the articles of the readers!) and to include it in
future possible prints for sale. Our question is: can we apply the CC
License only to the magazine in .pdf but not to the website itself,
which we would  like to keep under the traditional (c) "All rights
reserved"?

We would really appreciate if somebody could give some advice,

Thank you very much for taking the time.
