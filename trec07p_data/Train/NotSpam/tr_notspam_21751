Subject: Count co-occurrences
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Dear all,

I wrote a simple sql querry to count co-occurrences between words but it 
performs very very slow on large datasets. So, it's time to do it with 
Perl. I need just a short tip to start out: which structure to use to 
count all possible occurrences between letters (e.g. A, B and C) under 
the particular document number. My dataset looks like following:

1 A
1 B
1 C
1 B
2 A
2 A
2 B
2 C
etc. till doc. number 100.000

The result file should than be similar to:
A B 4   ### 2 co-occurrences under doc. number 1 + 2 co-occurrences 
under doc. number 2
A C 3   ### 1 co-occurrence under doc. number 1 + 2 co-occurrences under 
doc. number 2
B C 3   ### 2 co-occurrences under doc. number 1 + 1 co-occurrence under 
doc. number 2

Thanks in advance for any pointers.

Best, Andrej
