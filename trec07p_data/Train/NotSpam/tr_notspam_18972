Changes and additions:

   SR-49 (06/13/07): Solar array retracted 7.5 bays; EVA on tap; Russian co=
mputers down again
   SR-50 (06/13/07): Spacewalk begins
   SR-51 (06/13/07): Solar array pulled in nearly 50 feet; more work Thursd=
ay but flight controllers pleased with progress
   SR-52 (06/13/07): Russian computer troubleshooting continues

7:33 PM, 6/13/07, Update: Russian engineers continue computer troubleshooti=
ng=20

Three critical computers in the Russian section of the international space =
station that help control the lab's orientation remain out of action today =
following problems Tuesday. Among other things, the station uses the comput=
ers to fire Russian rocket thrusters to adjust the station's attitude when =
U.S. gyroscopes are insufficient.

The control system computers work in concert, comparing results as a safegu=
ard against bad data or results. On Tuesday, amid work to attach a new 36,0=
00-pound U.S. solar array segment to the station, the computers apparently =
crashed because of an as-yet-unknown problem. Russian engineers then attemp=
ted to reboot the machines to recover from the problem, but they were not s=
uccessful. Additional attempts today failed as well, officials said.

Maintaining the proper orientation is critical for station operations to en=
sure its solar arrays generate enough electricity and to maintain temperatu=
res within allowable limits. The Russian computer system also controls a va=
riety of other systems, including the Elektron oxygen generator. Life suppo=
rt systems, however, can be commanded independently.

At present, the control moment gyroscopes in the U.S. segment are maintaini=
ng attitude and the shuttle Atlantis' rocket thrusters can be used if large=
r motions are required. But eventually, the Russian computer system must be=
 restored to operation.

It is not yet clear whether the Russian computer system suffered a hardware=
 failure or some sort of software problem. One engineer said a hardware fai=
lure that could take out all three attitude attitude control computers was =
unlikely and speculated the Russians eventually would sort out the problem =
and restart the computers.

Unlike NASA, the Russian space agency does not have its own communications =
satellites. To troubleshoot the computer problem, Russian engineers must wa=
it until the station is within line-of-site of Russian ground stations to d=
ownlink telemetry. That will not happen again until early Thursday.
