Lou Dobbs Tonight
Thursday May 10, 2007

Tonight, President Bush meets with the military’s top brass at
the Pentagon as he faces rising pressure from his own party to
achieve results in Iraq.

The Washington Post company makes contributions to CASA of
Maryland, an organization that supports illegal aliens.
Accuracy in Media concluded that CASA provided documents to
illegal aliens with advice on how to evade deportation. We’ll
have a special report on how the Washington Post’s ability to
report without bias on the immigration issue.

In Congress today, the Senate Finance Committee is holding a
hearing on the struggles and challenges middle class American
families are facing to make ends meet. And, the House Small
Business Committee is holding a hearing to explore the impact
illegal aliens are having on small businesses in America. We’ll
have full coverage.

It’s clear from recent FDA press conferences and Congressional
hearings that contaminated gluten and flour products from
Communist China invaded America’s food supply months before
they were discovered. Millions of chickens, thousands of hogs
and an unknown number of fish have been affected.  Join us
tonight; we’ll be taking a look at the House Committee on
Agriculture’s hearing where officials demanded to know why the
response was so slow.

And we’ll have a full report on the verdict in the case of Chi
Mak, the naturalized American citizen and electrical engineer
charged with conspiring to smuggle American navy secrets to
China.

Then, Senator Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, says people should be
given green cards in this country based on skills and merit --
not family ties. He joins Lou tonight.

Visit http://cnn.com/loudobbstonight to read Lou’s
latest commentary on how the separation of church and state in
this country is narrowing.

Lou Dobbs lays out his manifesto to save the middle class in
his new book, “War on the Middle Class: How the Government, Big
Business, and Special Interest Groups Are Waging War on the
American Dream and How to Fight Back.” War on the Middle Class
is now on sale in bookstores near you and on Amazon.com and
BarnesandNoble.com.
