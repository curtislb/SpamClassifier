Hi Anna, 

I'm the sas.get problem man.

I still have not gotten it to work but I think that is
because I have some slightly dodgy SAS files. 
Assuming that the sas.get problem is what was
described in the earlier thread it appears to have
been fixed.  You might want to do an update to R to
get the most recent Hmisc. 

An alternative in Hmisc that Frank Harrell pointed out
is to do a SAS export file and a special version of
the format file.  

It is described in the Hmisc reference manual See
sasxport.get . It worked just fine for me on a couple
of test files. I don't remember but I think you're
stuck with the 8 character variable names though.
