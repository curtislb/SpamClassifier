The bottom line is that this license stuff for a developer such as me is all 
absurd, and I'm not going to worry about it any longer. 

I've decided for the moment to go with a straight GPL v2 license, and if I can 
over time eliminate all the GPL copyrighted code by others, I will switch to 
a nice simple license that provides a "tit for a tat" clause as Linus calls 
it  (i.e. requires releasing the source if you modify and distribute it).

In the mean time, I sincerely hope that Debian finds some way to continue 
releasing Bacula.

Regards,

Kern
