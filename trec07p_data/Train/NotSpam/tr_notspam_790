Ah yes.  I think I had it in one attempt and then
decided I had misread the documentation.

Yes. It was correct in the orginal program but I got a
typo then sticking it in the posting.  I have
corrected it. Thanks

Just tried it.  I had originally renamed them from
form_ea1 etc because I did not trust the " _ " .

I was a bit too groggy yesterday to understand the
warning about the format file . I now have it renamed
'format.sas7dbat' which R, or SAS,  is telling me
cannot be found.  
 

So far I have cleaned up all of this with no luck.

Now,  on to Tim's hack! 

Thanks for all the help.
