Will probably do that for the commands but was particularly
wondering how other synths handled indexing.  The accent
for example sends 0x06 back as a marker whenever the user
drops an index into a stream or can be queried with an
escape code.  As long as the other synths do something like
that it might have a chance at being compatible.
