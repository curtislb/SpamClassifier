I'll agree that compaq desktops pretty much suck, but the workstation 
models I've had experience with (mainly deskpro 4000 series) have been 
pretty good, and their server machines are really nice imho.  Though 
there are some stupid design choices  in the desktop and workstation 
models that really irritate me, such as the hdd-based bios setup 
program.
