6:24 PM, 6/19/07, Update: Atlantis undocks from space station (UPDATED at 6=
:24 p.m. with news conference; quotes and details)

With pilot Lee Archambault at the controls, the shuttle Atlantis undocked f=
rom the international space station today at 10:42 a.m. as the two spacecra=
ft sailed high above New Guinea.

"Houston and ISS, from Atlantis, physical separation," radioed commander Ri=
ck Sturckow as the shuttle pulled away at a sedate tenth of a mile per hour.

"Thank you very much," called station commander Fyodor Yurchikhin, who foll=
owed naval tradition by ringing the ship's bell in the Destiny laboratory m=
odule. "Atlantis departure."

"Thank you ISS," Sturckow radioed. "Have a great remainder of your expediti=
on 15. We'll see you back on planet Earth."

Spectacular video from the shuttle showed the space station, now sporting t=
wo huge solar wings on each end of its main solar power truss, sailing agai=
nst the black of deep space and then the myriad hues of South America, the =
Atlantic Ocean and Europe as the shuttle looped over and around the lab com=
plex.

Later, as Atlantis dropped behind the station and slowly pulled away, a dra=
matic shot from a camera looking back past the tail of the shuttle showed t=
he space station small in the distance, its face-on solar arrays looking li=
ke the wings of a "Star Wars" TIE fighter.

Flight controllers were thrilled.

"Today was just another great day in the space business," said lead Flight =
Director Cathy Koerner. "I cannot be more pleased, again, with the flight c=
ontrol teams, all the ground teams and the crew, the performance today was =
outstanding. We had a picture-perfect undocking and fly-around.

"We did a complete fly-around of the international space station in its new=
 configuration," Koerner said, narrating a short video. "Here you see the s=
pace station just there, trailing behind the shuttle well after undocking a=
nd the separation burns. We refer to this as our TIE Fighter video, for tho=
se of you who are 'Star Wars' fans. Upon seeing this video, one of the mana=
gers remarked that we'd rather have a TIE Fighter than an imperial cruiser =
back there."

Said Mike Suffredini, manager of the space station program at the Johnson S=
pace Center in Houston: "As Cathy said, it was picture-perfect for departur=
e and the space station finally looks symmetrical, it hasn't looked that wa=
y in a while. And we were happy to see that."

Earlier, a camera in the shuttle's cargo bay spotted numerous sparkling obj=
ects slowly drifting across the field of view - presumably harmless pieces =
of ice - along with one much larger, more distinct piece of debris of some =
sort. It was not immediately clear whether the object was from the space st=
ation or the shuttle.

It's not unusual to see small bits of ice or debris leaving the shuttle aft=
er jarring rocket firings and Suffredini said this one was probably more of=
 the same. But image analysts were studying the video to make sure.

"During separation, you may have noticed what looked like a white object le=
aving the international space station, the orbiter was quite a bit away," S=
uffredini said. "We're off looking at that object to see if it was actually=
 a station or a shuttle object. When we complete that review, we'll share t=
hat information with you."

Around 5:30 p.m., Sturckow reported yet another piece of debris leaving the=
 area of the shuttle. It was not immediately clear whether any of the sight=
ings were related.

"Hey Kevin, we just spotted an object floating up out of the payload bay," =
he told Kevin Ford in mission control. "And we've identified it. All over t=
he payload bay there are little phenolic-looking, kind of tan-looking washe=
rs with four slots in them and then they've got some string that hold them =
on to tie down the MLI (multi-layer insulation) blankets. And one of them h=
as come loose and departed the payload bay."

"OK, C.J., we copy that. Thanks for the words on that," Ford replied.

Joining Archambault and Sturckow aboard Atlantis were flight engineer Steve=
 Swanson, Patrick Forrester, Danny Olivas, Jim Reilly and Sunita Williams, =
who is returning to Earth after a record six months in space, the longest s=
ingle flight by a female astronaut.

She was replaced by Clay Anderson, who hitched a ride to the station aboard=
 Atlantis to join Yurchikhin and flight engineer Oleg Kotov.

"Godspeed, C.J.," Anderson radioed Sturckow as Atlantis pulled away. "Thank=
s for everything."

Working from the aft flight deck, Archambault guided Atlantis straight away=
 from the space station to a point directly in front of the lab complex bef=
ore beginning a slow 360-degree fly-around to permit his crewmates to photo=
graph the station and its new solar arrays.

"One of the big reasons we do this is so we can get good documentation, pho=
to imagery of the space station as we leave it," Archambault said. "At a mi=
nimum, we'll be backing out to approximately 400 feet. ... We'll do a 360-(=
degree trip) round the space station to get good photo imagery from all ang=
les."

After the fly-around was complete, the shuttle astronauts took a break for =
lunch and then used the ship's robot arm to pick up the orbiter boom sensor=
 system, or OBSS, for a final set of nose cap and wing leading edge inspect=
ions.

"On flight day two, the scans are primarily looking for damage caused by th=
e launch environment," Koerner said in a pre-flight briefing. "Here, what w=
e're looking for are any micrometeoroid impacts that may have occurred whil=
e we were on orbit. And again, we're trying to ensure the integrity of the =
thermal protection system before entry day."

There were no immediate signs of any problems.
