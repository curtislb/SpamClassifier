I'm going to stay away from the "POD referencing Perl" debate for the
time being.  Instead, a couple of thoughts:

1. It has always been my understanding that comments intimately relate
to documentation, despite being part of Perl's syntax.  As such, they
are a technical violation of this "separation of Church and State",
being State-sponsored religion as it were. (Who'd have thought that
we'd be talking politics and religion on a programming language
mailing list?  Egad!)  Not that I'm advocating the removal of
comments; their sheer practical value makes up for their heathen ways.

2. Getting block comments to hide POD blocks wouldn't require the POD
parser to have a full implementation of a Perl parser.  It would
require the POD parser to have a _limited_ implementation of a Perl
parser, one that's capable of identifying block comments.  And IIRC,
you already have to do something like this with respect to block
quotes:

  say :to(END);
  =begin POD
  blah blah blah
  =end POD
  END

If I understand matters correctly, the "POD code" in the above example
isn't POD code at all, but rather the content of a multi-line quote.
So extending the POD parser's awareness of Perl syntax to handle block
comments as well isn't much of a stretch.
