What are you talking about?

If by "legal composition of copyright" you mean "license texts are copyrighted,
so they cannot be DFSG-free", that's false.  We include plenty of copyrighted
materials which are DFSG-free.

If by "legal composition of copyright" you mean "license texts are used to
indicate how other things are copyrighted, and cannot do that if they are
modified", that's wrong.  You're assuming that "modifying a license" means 
"trying to relicense the thing the license is attached to".  That's incorrect.
One might want to modify a license in order to reuse the license somewhere
else.  Modifying a license in this way has no bearing on the licensing of
the work to which the license was originally attached, and the copyright of
the work does not restrict modifying the license this way.
