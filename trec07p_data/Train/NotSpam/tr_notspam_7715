The Working Group on Intellectual Property (GTPI) from the Brazilian Network for the Integration of Peoples (REBRIP) sends this statement
(share widely & congratulations to the Brazilian Civil Society!)

Statement:

The Working Group on Intellectual Property (GTPI) from the Brazilian Network for the Integration of Peoples (REBRIP) expresses its support
for the federal government’s decision to issue a compulsory licence for the antiviral drug, Efavirenz, whose patent is current held by Merck
Sharp & Dohme. This historical decision reinforces the efforts of civil society groups fighting for access to medicines, for the sustainability
of public health policies, such as universal and unlimited access to antiretroviral medicines used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS, and for the
strengthening of the Brazilian public health care system, the Unique Health System (SUS).

We would like to emphasize that the use of compulsory licences is a legal and legitimate instrument recognized by both Brazilian law and
international trade agreements, namely the TRIPS agreement of the World Trade Organisation. The interests behind the drafting and adoption of
this agreement are becoming clearer every day and demonstrate how knowledge and technological goods are being appropriated by private
interests, increasing the profit margins of multinational companies.

These profits are extremely high, especially when one considers that they are earned thanks to the protection of products that are essential
for human survival – in this case, medicines.

In light of the discouraging situation that exists in the world today – in which nations are divided between producers and consumers of
technology and therefore, between owners of patents and those dependent who depend on them and other intellectual protections – we, members of
organized civil society, believe that the actual patent system and the multilateral organisation supporting it do not represent the interests
of developing countries. On the contrary, we defend our right to protect people’s access to essential goods, the maintenance and respect of
current safeguards, as well as the humanization of trade.

Finally, we consider sovereignty as a central political and judicial bases institution of the State. As such, trade agreements must not
prevent States from adopting measures that aim to protect health, safety and the independence of the people. In this sense, the measure adopted
by the Brazilian government today represents a victory of common-sense in dealing with the question of access, and can and should stimulate the
issuing of licences for other medications that are fundamental for the treatment of various diseases affecting the country.

Best Regards and thank you for everything,

Claudio Oliveira
