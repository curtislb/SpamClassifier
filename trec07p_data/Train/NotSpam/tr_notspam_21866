A message to KTWARWIC@SPEEDY.UWATERLOO.CA from the LARRYKING was returned
as undeliverable.  It eventually  made it  through to  you since  you are
reading this message, but there was a problem with the delivery.

After an e-mail is undeliverable, there  is the possibility that you will
be  removed  from that  list  automatically.  Please send  the  following
command in  the message  body to  LISTSERV@CNNIMAIL23.CNN.COM as  soon as
possible:

                            CONFIRM LARRYKING

This will tell LISTSERV that your account actually does work and that you
still want to receive mail from the LARRYKING list.

Thank you.
