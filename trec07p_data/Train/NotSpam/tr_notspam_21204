Hi

Interesting, well if anyone is serious about having speakup in the main kernel source such issues like this should be resolved.  It's not as clear cut as you state.  I didn't think my 2.6.21.3 source came up with that error. 
We'll never know now because after building a kernel, the error goes away.  Let's call it the virgin bug.  <smiles>

Regards

Gena

I remember seeing this at least since 2.6.19, and probably earlier, it's
been like that for a good while. I always assumed it was a problem
with the kernel source itself, rather than the speakup patch, since I
never bothered running mrproper on a clean source, as I mentioned in
another thread here earlier. 

Since everything compiles and works fine anyway, I just ignored it,
and didn't worry about it, or bother mentioning it.

I don't understand why that the patching of speakup is causing this error when issuing the mrproper command.  Because the file named in the error isn't part of the tar ball in the first place.  The mrproper command doesn't produce this error until the kernel has been patched with speakup.  I've downloaded and checked out with fresh tar balls and the results are the same.
