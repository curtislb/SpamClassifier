I'm quoting the full license text below, for reference purposes.

I _don't_ think it's compatible with GPLv2.

Clause 3 is a patch-only restriction, which is not a DFSG-freeness,
but is GPL-incompatible (as already noted by Andrew Donnellan).=20

That's really confusing.
If they really mean commercial, then the GNU GPL v2 allows commercial
use, but it seems the SEPL does as well...
If they instead mean proprietary, then the GNU GPL v2 forbids
proprietary use (in contrast to what they believe), while their SEPL is
a far weaker defense against proprietary use...

Puzzled.

My suggestion is to contact them again: try and persuade them to
relicense (or dual-license) the library under the GNU GPL v2.

I would say so, yes.

agree to any and all conditions in this license. Whole or partial
distribution of the SE in any form signifies acceptance of this license.

2. You may copy and distribute the SE provided that
the entire package is distributed, including this License.

3. You may make modifications to the SE files and distribute your
modifications in a form distinct from the SE. The following
restrictions apply to modifications:            =20

     a. Modifications must not alter or remove any copyright notices in
     the SE.

     b. If modifications to the SE are released under this
     license, a non-exclusive right is granted to the holder of the
     copyright of the unmodified SE to distribute your
     modification in future versions of the SE provided such
     versions remain available under these terms in addition to any
     other license. =20

4. You may distribute machine-executable forms of the SE or
machine-executable forms of modified versions of the SE, provided that
you meet these restrictions: =20

     a. You accompany the SE with this license.

     b. You must ensure that all recipients of the machine-executable
     forms are also able to receive the complete machine-readable
     source code to the distributed SE, including all
     modifications, without any charge beyond the costs of data
     transfer.

     c. You ensure that all modifications included in the
     machine-executable forms are available under the terms of this
     license.                         =20

5. You may use the original or modified versions of the Swiss Ephemeris
Software to compile, link and run application programs legally developed
by you or third parties.

6. You may develop application programs, reusable components and other
software items that link with the original or modified versions of the
Swiss Ephemeris Software. These items, when distributed in
machine-executable form, have the following restrictions: =20

     a. You must ensure that all recipients of machine-executable forms
     of these items are also able to receive and use the complete
     machine-readable source code to the items without any charge
     beyond the costs of data transfer.

     b. You must explicitly license all recipients of your items to use
     and re-distribute original and modified versions of the items in
     both machine-executable and source code forms under terms
     identical to those under which they received the items.     =20

7. The trademarks 'Swiss Ephemeris' and 'Swiss Ephemeris inside' and the
associated icons may be used for promoting software, products or
services which use or contain the Swiss Ephemeris.
The names of the authors of the Swiss Ephemeris Software and of the

prior written permission.

                          Limitations of Liability

In no event shall the authors of the Swiss Ephemeris Software or their
employers be liable for any lost revenue or profits or other direct,
indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages, even if they
