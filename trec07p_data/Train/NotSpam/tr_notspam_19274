Trade Negotiations and Agreements - What's New


The Government of Canada is seeking the Views of Canadians to Assess
Canadian Intellectual Property Interests in Selected Markets

-- On June 7, 2007 the Government of Canada announced the launch of Free
Trade Agreement negotiations with Peru, Colombia and the Dominican
Republic. Exploratory talks have also been held with the Caribbean
Community (CARICOM) Member States and Ecuador but no negotiations are
scheduled at this time.
