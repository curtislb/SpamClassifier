Sampling Plus 1.0

CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE
LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS LICENSE DOES NOT CREATE AN
ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS
INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES
REGARDING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR
DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE.

License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS
PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE
WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND
AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS
YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF
SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

   a. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue,
   anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in
   unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions,
   constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are
   assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
   Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as
   defined below) for the purposes of this License.

   b. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the
   Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical
   arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture
   version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,
   condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
   transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a
   Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the
   purpose of this License.

   c. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work
   under the terms of this License.

   d. "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the
   Work.

   e. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under
   the terms of this License.

   f. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
   License who has not previously violated the terms of this License
   with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission
   from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a
   previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce,
   limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or
   other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner
   under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant & Restrictions. Subject to the terms and conditions
   of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide,
   royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the
   applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as
   stated below on the conditions as stated below:

   a. Re-creativity permitted. You may create and reproduce Derivative
   Works, provided that:

         i. the Derivative Work(s) constitute a good-faith partial or
         recombined usage employing "sampling," "collage," "mash-up,"
         or other comparable artistic technique, whether now known or
         hereafter devised, that is highly transformative of the
         original, as appropriate to the medium, genre, and market
         niche; and

         ii. Your Derivative Work(s) must only make a partial use of
         the original Work, or if You choose to use the original Work
         as a whole, You must either use the Work as an insubstantial
         portion of Your Derivative Work(s) or transform it into
         something substantially different from the original Work. In
         the case of a musical Work and/or audio recording, the mere
         synchronization ("synching") of the Work with a moving image
         shall not be considered a transformation of the Work into
         something substantially different.

   b. You may distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly,
   perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
   transmission, any Derivative Work(s) authorized under this License.

   c. Prohibition on advertising. All advertising and promotional uses
   are excluded from the above rights, except for advertisement and
   promotion of the Derivative Work(s) that You are creating from the
   Work and Yourself as the author thereof.

   d. Noncommercial sharing of verbatim copies permitted.

         i. You may reproduce the Work, incorporate the Work into one
         or more Collective Works, and reproduce the Work as
         incorporated in the Collective Works. You may distribute
         copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
         publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
         transmission the Work including or incorporated in Collective
         Works.

         ii. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in
         the paragraph immediately above in any manner that is
         primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
         advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of
         the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital
         file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be
         intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
         private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment
         of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange
         of copyrighted works.

   5. Attribution and Notice.

         i. If You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
         publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works
         or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright
         notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit
         reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by
         conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the
         Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work if
         supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, provide the
         Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies
         to be associated with the Work or a Derivative Work, unless
         such Uniform Resource Identifier does not refer to the
         copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and
         in the case of a Derivative Work, provide a credit
         identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g.,
         "Remix of the Work by Original Author," or "Inclusion of a
         portion of the Work by Original Author in collage"). Such
         credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
         however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective
         Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other
         comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least
         as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

         ii. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform or
         publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of
         this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform
         Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or
         phonorecord of the Work or Derivative Work You distribute,
         publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
         perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
         that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the
         recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may
         not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices
         that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
         warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display,
         publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with
         any technological measures that control access of use of the
         Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
         License. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a
         Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective
         Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the
         terms of this License. Upon notice from any Licensor You
         must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative
         Work or Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the
         Original Author, as requested.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by
Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Disclaimer

UNLESS SPECIFIED OTHERWISE BY THE PARTIES IN A SEPARATE WRITING,
LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
DISCOVERABLE.

5. Limitation on Liability.

IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

6. Termination

   a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
   automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this
   License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works
   or Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not
   have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
   entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1,
   2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 will survive any termination of this License.

   b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted
   here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in
   the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right
   to release the Work under different license terms or to stop
   distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
   election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
   license that has been granted under the terms of this License), and
   this License will continue in full force and effect unless
   terminated as stated above.

7. Miscellaneous

   a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work
   or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
   license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license
   granted to You under this License.

   b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a
   Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
   original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license
   granted to You under this License.

   c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable
   under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
   enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and
   without further action by the parties to this agreement, such
   provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make
   such provision valid and enforceable.

   d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and
   no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
   writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or
   consent.

   e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the
   parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no
   understandings, agreements, or representations with respect to the
   Work, and with respect to the subject matter hereof, not specified
   above. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions
   that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not
   be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor
   and You.
