1:21 AM, 6/14/07, Update: NASA considers shuttle mission extension if Russi=
an computer glitch not resolved soon=20

A major computer failure in the Russian segment of the international space =
station, possibly triggered by the addition of new U.S. solar arrays earlie=
r this week, has shut down critical systems and left the outpost dependent =
on the shuttle Atlantis for any major changes in orientation. The space sta=
tion has plenty of supplies on board and the combined 10-member crew is in =
no immediate danger. But the space station cannot safely operate without th=
e Russian computers and the problem must be resolved before Atlantis depart=
s next week.

Russian engineers will "begin in ernest tomorrow morning to try techniques =
to recover these computers," said Mike Suffredini, manager of the space sta=
tion program at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. "I fully expect us to =
be able to do this. I'm not thinking this is something we will not recover =
from.

"But in the meantime, being NASA and the fact that we try to do everything =
we can to protect every option, we are looking at options to extend the tim=
e that the shuttle guys stay (docked) with us just in case we'd like an ext=
ra day or so. We can't extend it much, but we're certainly looking at that.=
 We're also looking at a number of different options for how we'd conserve =
(propellant) if we decided we needed more attitude control help from our sh=
uttle friends."

Space station assembly began in November 1998 and it has been continuously =
manned by rotating U.S. and Russian cosmonauts and astronauts since Novembe=
r 2000. Atlantis ferried a fresh U.S. astronaut to the station - Clay Ander=
son - to replace Sunita Williams, who was launched to the station last Dece=
mber aboard the shuttle Discovery. Shortly after Atlantis docked, Anderson =
officially joined Expedition 15 commander Fyodor Yurchikhin and flight engi=
neer Oleg Kotov. Williams, in turn, joined Atlantis' six-member crew.

The Russian segment of the space station utilizes three guidance, navigatio=
n and control computers to maintain the lab's orientation and make major or=
bit adjustments by firing rocket thrusters in the Zvezda command module. Th=
ree command-and-control computers also are available to operate a variety o=
f systems like the Russian Elektron oxygen generator and the Vozdukh carbon=
 dioxide scrubber.

For normal operations, the station relies on U.S. control moment gyroscopes=
, or CMGs, which can make small adjustments in orientation without the need=
 for fuel-consuming rocket firings. Controlling the station's orientation, =
or attitude, is critical for ensuring its solar arrays can stay lined up on=
 the sun and to prevent sensitive systems from getting too hot or too cold.

The Russian system features "three of those (guidance computers), they're a=
ll redundant to each other so any one of the computers can do the job," Suf=
fredini said. "And then we have (three) command-and-control-type computers,=
 called 'lanes,' any one of which can do the command-and-control function. =
And then we have computers on the U.S. segment that talk to these computers=
."

When problems occur that might take down the guidance computers, the system=
 is programmed to reboot itself and in the past, that procedure successfull=
y resolved a variety of problems. This time around, it didn't.

On Monday, the Atlantis astronauts attached a new 36,000-pound solar array =
truss segment featuring two new solar blankets capable of generating some 2=
0 kilowatts of additional useable power. On Tuesday, a computer crash occur=
red that ultimately left the Russian segment with a single guidance compute=
r and a single command-and-control machine. That, in and of itself, was not=
 crippling.

But Wednesday morning, as the Atlantis astronauts were beginning work to re=
tract a different solar array wing, "we lost both of those computers," Suff=
redini said. "Currently we're in that configuration. The guidance, navigati=
on and control computers and command-and-control computers in the service m=
odule are not functioning. Our Russian colleagues tried a number of techniq=
ues to try to recover the computers and were not successful."

Unlike NASA, the Russian space agency does not have its own communications =
satellites. To troubleshoot the computer problem, Russian engineers had to =
wait until the station was within line-of-site of Russian ground stations t=
o downlink telemetry, beginning early Thursday.

The combined shuttle-station crews have plenty of oxygen, food and water, a=
long with carbon dioxide removal capability. Even so, "this is a very serio=
us situation," Russian flight controllers told Yurchikhin early today.

"Where does that leave us? The guidance, navigation and control computers a=
llow the system to control the attitude and provide propulsion, if necessar=
y, with Russian thrusters," Suffredini said. "Without those computers, we c=
an't get attitude control from the Russian system. That's not a problem for=
 us, the CMGs (U.S. control moment gyroscopes), in fact, are controlling th=
e attitude and they've done a very fine job. ... If they saturate (get over=
loaded), we can hand over to the shuttle system and they can take care of t=
he attitude control function."

"That's not an urgent situation but clearly we need to get this resolved be=
fore our shuttle friends leave," Suffredini said. "We have plenty of resour=
ces and plenty of time to sort this out. We have in the history of the prog=
ram often had these computers go down, one or two lanes. It's not uncommon =
to be on one lane of each system and wait for the last one to finally give =
up and then the whole system reboots itself and starts back up. Of course, =
what's unique is when the system went to reboot itself it wasn't able to do=
 that."

Engineers are trying to identify changes in the station's configuration or =
the space environment that might have triggered the crashes, including spac=
e radiation and the electrical environment around the station.

"The one that folks are starting to look at and scratching their heads a bi=
t about is we did, of course, add another power source in the form of the S=
3/S4 (solar array) truss, so we're off looking at is there anything about t=
hat power source that may make it slightly different for reasons that aren'=
t clear ... that may have affected the ability of these computers to operat=
e correctly," Suffredini said. "And then, of course, on the Russian segment=
 there are a number of things our Russian colleagues will look at as well t=
o see if they can figure it out."

Suffredini said engineers have not ruled out a software glitch, but no soft=
ware changes were made over the past few days and all six computers "didn't=
 just all have a hardware failure. It appears to me that something has chan=
ged in the environment, either something in the (space) environment or the =
source of power to these computers is different coming from S3/S4 for reaso=
ns we do not understand."

"Our Russian colleagues believe it's the power source," he said. "That's th=
e latest theory they have. They've suggested that perhaps we could  stop fe=
eding them power and let them just use their own internal power to bring up=
 their computers and see if that solves that particular problem. They canno=
t run (completely) on their own power because of all the systems to handle =
the entire crew. We have to feed them a certain amount of power to keep eve=
rything running that we need to run. So eventually we have to work through =
that.

"Another option we're working through is just stop feeding them power from =
the S3 truss, which is maybe the first thing we'll try. We're still sorting=
 through our plan."

In the meantime, shuttle planners are assessing possible power conservation=
 steps that would permit Atlantis to remain docked an extra day if necessar=
y. As of late Wednesday, the shuttle had enough hydrogen and oxygen for its=
 electricity producing fuel cells for an additional 18 hours of docked acti=
vity. By deferring the planned transfer of 40 pounds of oxygen to the stati=
on, the shuttle crew will likely be able to get an extra docked day if nece=
ssary.

"We have to have propulsive attitude control even with CMGs," Suffredini sa=
id. "The CMGs do a great job but occasionally they get saturated and when t=
hey get saturated, we need propulsive attitude control in order to recover.=
 The other need for propulsion is to make sure we can do debris avoidance m=
aneuvers, to adjust our orbit for dockings, there's a number of reasons why=
 we need propulsive attitude control. That's a requirement of the ISS. We h=
ave to have that capability."

In a worst-case scenario, he said, the astronauts would have to abandon the=
 station and come back to Earth. The Expedition 15 crew would come home in =
a Russian Soyuz capsule while the shuttle crew would depart aboard Atlantis.

But that's strictly worst case, Suffredini said, adding he was confident th=
e Russians would resolve the problem in short order.
