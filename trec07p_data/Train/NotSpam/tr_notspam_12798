Scott,

Yum works much better then apt in fedora. It is simply a case of
learning the syntax. 
yum install  -- to install a package.
yum update -- to update the system
yum remove -- to remove a package.

By default, yum is setup to automatically update the system through
cron. I think it is nightly, but I don't remember exactly, because I
changed my to run weekly.
