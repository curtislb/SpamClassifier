I guess the this is actually a bug in both samba3 and samba4.

In samba4 I found this in include/includes.h:

#if 0
/* darn, we can't do this now that we don't link the ldb tools to all
the smb libs */
#define TALLOC_ABORT(reason) smb_panic(reason)
#endif


I guess this code was disabled at some point by mistake, we should have
redefined TALLOC_ABORT() in the ldb tools if this was relevant.

I also guess that when we re-merged talloc in samba3 and samba4 this
code was omitted by mistake.

Not sure how should we fix it.

Simo.
