Lou Dobbs Tonight
Thursday, April 12, 2007

Tonight, a suicide bomber managed to infiltrate the heavily
fortified Green Zone in Baghdad today. The explosion killed at
least eight people, at least two of them MPs. How did this
bomber sneak past security? Can this happen again? We’ll have
the latest from Iraq tonight.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez announced the United
States would place tariffs on Chinese coated paper imports in
an effort to help American workers. But Business Week has
uncovered the biggest beneficiaries are not American workers at
all…they’re private equity firms with close ties to the White
House. Tonight, we’ll follow up on the report.

The Senate Appropriations Committee on Agriculture held a
hearing today to examine the widespread contamination of pet
food across America. Sixteen pets died and hundreds more were
sickened by contaminated wheat gluten found in the food. The
FDA has recalled more than 100 brands of pet food so far. We’ll
have a full report on the hearing, as well as what can be done
to make sure this doesn’t happen again.

The trial in the case of naturalized American citizen and
electrical engineer Chi Mak continued today in Santa Ana,
California. Mak is charged with conspiring to smuggle American
navy secrets to China. We’ll have a report on today’s testimony
from an FBI agent on Chinese espionage.

And Lou will be joined by Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Sen.
Byron Dorgan of North Dakota. The three men discuss how the
United States has failed Americans with its foreign trade
policies.

tonight’s show.

Lou Dobbs lays out his manifesto to save the middle class in
his new book, “War on the Middle Class: How the Government, Big
Business, and Special Interest Groups Are Waging War on the
American Dream and How to Fight Back.” War on the Middle Class
is now on sale in bookstores near you and on Amazon.com and
BarnesandNoble.com.
