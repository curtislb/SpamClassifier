Hi,
Setup a dual boot system with Windows as the default operating system to 
boot.  Give a long enough time delay to allow you to press the down arrow 
when you want to go into Linux.
If your farther starts up, he will go into windows.
If you start up, you press down arrow and enter and go into Linux.
HTH, Willem
