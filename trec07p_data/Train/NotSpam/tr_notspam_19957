Pages of stolen Aurangzeb manuscript found

Patna, June 15: Police have recovered 19 of the 110 pages of a rare
manuscript - authored by 17th century Mughal emperor Aurangzeb and said to
be worth Rs.10 million today - that was stolen from a Bihar school library
last year. 

Gaya district superintendent of police Amit Jain said Friday they recovered
some pages, including the cover page, of the manuscript "Gulistan" from a
house in Gaya town, about 100 km from here. 

Three people were arrested while negotiating its sale with a Kolkata-based
antique dealer who had offered them Rs.2 million for the pages.

"Now our concern is to recover the remaining pages of the rarest of rare
manuscript," Jain told IANS over telephone. He hinted that the arrested
criminals had given some clues but refused to elaborate.

"Gulistan", written in Persian, was stolen from the Tekari Raj High School
library in Gaya about six months ago. Police suspected the hand of
international smugglers, dealing in antiques, in the theft.

The crime highlighted the fact that such a rare manuscript had been kept
casually in a school library. Incidentally, Magadh Divisional Commissioner
S.K. Negi had cautioned the school authorities about its safety. 

An expert valued the manuscript to be worth over Rs.10 million in the
international market. 

"Gulistan", which incorporates colourful paintings and embroidery, also has
a picture (sketch) of Aurangzeb - who lived from 1618 to 1707 - printed on
the cover page.

"The rare manuscript was lying in the school for over 100 years," a district
official said. 

There are two theories on how Aurangzeb's "Gulistan" arrived in this school
in Tekari, an erstwhile royal estate. 

The first one says in 18th century the then king of Alwar in Rajasthan had
sold it to his Tekari counterpart for Rs.10,000. It was later donated to the
school that was established by the then queen of Tekari, Rani Rajroop
Kunwar, in 1876 for the education of her son Gopal Sharan, who later became
the king of Tekari.

The second theory says the manuscript could have been presented as a gift to
the Tekari estate during Auurangzeb's visit. It was later donated to the
school by Rani Rajroop Kunwar.

June 16, 2007 

THE most famous exhibit at the Art Gallery of NSW reminds me of Joni
Mitchell, who sang of how you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone. The
theft of A Cavalier (Self-Portrait) has catapulted a hitherto obscure,
albeit saleable, painting to a prominence it never had when it was on
display.
That such an unheralded picture, painted by 17th-century Dutch artist Frans
van Mieris I, could arouse widespread public interest by suddenly
disappearing is nothing new, since this is one of the recurring ironies in
the long and colourful history of art theft. 

The international police agency Interpol ranks art theft as the third most
lucrative form of illicit international trade after drugs and arms. Works of
art, like drugs and arms, are valuable and portable, and their appeal knows
no borders. Art is also relatively accessible. 

Theft can do wonders for a painting's reputation. We are used to the Mona
Lisa being referred to as the most famous painting in the world, but that
status was attained only after it was stolen in August 1911. The theft of
the Mona Lisa was not noticed for 24 hours, but the news quickly travelled
across the world. While more than 60 detectives scoured Paris, the absent
painting in the popular imagination was transformed into the cultural symbol
we know today. 

As Darian Leader writes in Stealing the Mona Lisa: "Crowds gathered at the
Louvre to gaze at the empty space where the picture had once hung. Many of
these excited spectators, it turned out, had never been to the Louvre or,
indeed, seen the picture before." 

When he was caught two years later, the culprit, an Italian carpenter named
Vincenzo Peruggia, claimed to be a liberator rather than a thief. He
declared that the painting rightfully belonged in Italy, conveniently
ignoring that Leonardo da Vinci had happily sold it to the king of France
400 years earlier. 

Also claiming a higher motive than monetary gain was the mysterious thief or
thieves who perpetrated the most famous art theft in Australian history, at
least until now. 

In August 1986, Picasso's Weeping Woman disappeared from the National
Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne. In its place on the wall was a card with
the letters ACT written on it. Staff assumed the painting had been lent to
the national capital. In fact the acronym stood for Australian Cultural
Terrorists, which announced it had kidnapped the painting in return for
increased state government support for local artists. 

In his memoir The Bright Shapes and the True Names, Patrick McCaughey,
director of the NGV at the time, says he was mistaken in his assumption that
the level of after-hours security was adequate: "I learned later, however,
that the guards did not turn on the lights in the galleries but moved
through the huge building with a flashlight. In Roy Ground's echoing spaces
you could have hidden an elephant and evaded such a level of detection." 

Stolen art is sometimes not recovered for generations, if at all, and two
decades after the theft, McCaughey still has no idea who perpetrated the
theft, though he suspects it was an inside job, the likeliest scenario in
such cases, according to the experts. 

At least the Weeping Woman was returned unharmed by someone who evidently
knew how to take care of it. One of the biggest art thefts in history also
proved to be among the most destructive. During a six-year period from 1995,
French waiter Stephane Breitweiser, with the assistance of his girlfriend,
stole 239 works from 172 European galleries, including 60 old masters. When
his mother discovered the priceless haul, she cut up most of the artworks or
dumped them in a canal. 

Art theft often overlaps, unwittingly or not, with other crimes such as
forgery and fraud. In 2004, artist John Opit claimed that a burglar had
stolen art valued at $67 million from his home in Limpinwood, near the
NSW-Queensland border. Most valuable of all, Opit said, was a Cezanne
portrait worth $50 million. The police and art experts disagreed, and the
painting, which was scientifically tested after it was recovered from a
garage on the Gold Coast, was generally dismissed as a fake. 

The Opit theft may have been the real theft of fake French impressionist
art, but the reverse occurred in 1992, when Boston ophthalmologist Steven
Cooperman reported that two of his paintings, a Monet and a Pissarro, had
been stolen even though the alarm at his home had not gone off and there
were no signs of forced entry. Despite this, Cooperman successfully sued his
disbelieving insurers for $US17.5 million. Five years later, the FBI
secretly recorded incriminating phone calls in which Cooperman urged his
lawyer to chop up the paintings to remove traces of the scam. 

Theft on a mass scale is called looting and that goes back to the tomb
raiders who went to work not long after the ancient mausoleums were built.
Antiquities and art have been regularly stolen ever since. 

The biggest looters in modern history were Napoleon Bonaparte, Adolf Hitler
and Joseph Stalin. The Nazi plundering of Europe's art treasures continues
to have repercussions, as the Queensland Art Gallery discovered when a claim
was made in 2000 that a 15th-century German portrait of the Virgin and Child
it purchased in 1980 had rightfully belonged to Oscar Bondy, a Jewish art
connoisseur from Vienna whose collection had been confiscated by the Nazis
in 1939. After an extensive inquiry, that claim was proved true. 

The theft last weekend of A Cavalier puts the picture in impressive company.
The catalogue of lost art rivals all others, according to Simon Houpt in his
history of art theft, The Museum of the Missing. The immense gallery of
stolen art "would hold perhaps 150 Rembrandts and 500 Picassos. You could
stroll through the Renaissance galleries to admire Raphaels and Titians, da
Vincis and Durers, Rubenses and Caravaggios." One thing is certain. If A
Cavalier is recovered, we'll never look at it in the same way.

An "idiotic" thief who stole a 17th century porcelain figurine of national
importance was caught out when he wrote to a ceramics expert asking for a
valuation. 

Jason Cochlin, 32, was part of a gang who took the figure of Ignis - the
personification of fire - and 11 others from the Allen Gallery in Alton,
Hampshire, in 2002. 


The 1679 tin-glazed figure, described in court as a piece of Britain's
heritage, was worth up to ?160,000.

The figurine: Worth ?160,000


Cochlin, who has not named his fellow thieves, was found guilty of
conspiracy to steal the pieces at Winchester Crown Court and jailed for 12
months. 


His barrister Robert Pawson said Cochlin, from Southampton, had been forced
to take part in the conspiracy because he owed a debt to someone. 


He said Cochlin had used a loan of ?20,000 to buy Ignis back from the
criminal who had it, and told the court the married father of three could
not name him otherwise he would be shot. 


"Mr Cochlin was idiotic enough to write to a world expert on English
earthenware, Jonathan Horne, giving the insignia of the figure and asking
for a valuation," said Mr Pawson. 


Mr Horne knew the treasure - made in London as a commission for a client
interested in alchemy and science - was stolen. He contacted the museum and
they called the police. 


After he was caught, Cochlin handed the undamaged figure, which he had kept
wrapped in towels inside a shoebox, back to police.

Art Imitating Art

 Bruce Museum Exhibit Looks At Rip-Offs Of The Masters 
June 17, 2007 

By MATT EAGAN, The Hartford Courant 
 John Myatt says they called him Picasso in prison. Myatt was the brush
behind one of the most famous art frauds of modern times. During the 1980s
and '90s, he painted works in the style of Picasso, Joan Miro, Alberto
Giacometti and others.

Along with his partner, John Drewe, Myatt was able to create paintings that
fooled major auction houses into paying out as much as 30,000 pounds for
what they believed was a genuine work by a major artist.The scheme was
uncovered only after Drewe, who produced the fake documentation for the
works, left his wife for another woman but failed to take the fake papers
with him. His wife turned them in to police, and the two were arrested.

Such frauds remain the fear of everyone in the art world, especially at
museums, where the most basic guarantee made to customers is that the art on
display is genuine.

Artists such as Myatt, and the illusory works they create, are the subject
of "Fakes and Forgeries: The Art of Deception," an exhibit running through
Sept. 9 at the Bruce Museum in Greenwich.

Myatt, who testified against Drewe at a 1999 trial and went to prison for
four months, will appear at a dinner lecture Wednesday night to discuss his
experiences and his now-legitimate work as a producer of replicas. If
nothing else, the exhibit makes clear that as soon as someone decided to
create art, someone else decided to fake it. There are attempted forgeries
from all eras, from a Cycladic head supposedly from 2,500 B.C. to works that
rip off Norman Rockwell, Andy Warhol or Jean-Michel Basquiat.Nancy
Hall-Duncan, the exhibit's curator, says determining what is authentic is a
great challenge when one takes into account the many fake, forged, copied,
misattributed and replicated works in existence.

In the simplest terms, a fake attempts to replicate an existing work. A
forgery mimics the style of another artist in a deliberate attempt to
deceive others.

Simply attempting to replicate another artist's work is not a crime until
one claims it to be an original.

In fact, copying the works of the masters has long been a method of teaching
students advanced techniques.

As science has advanced, so have methods for detecting cheats.

According to research scientist James Martin, art detectives now use a
variety of sophisticated methods such as ultraviolet illumination and
electron micrographs to unmask frauds. Through these methods, it's sometimes
possible to uncover something that doesn't belong, such as a pigment that
was not available at the time the actual artist was working.

But usually these tools are only used once the sharp eye of a connoisseur
has raised questions about a painting's authenticity.

"Connoisseurship is the time-honored analytic process by which informed
viewers offer their opinion on who created a work of art, when and where,"
says Peter Sutton, the Bruce Museum's executive director.

But connoisseurship is not always perfect.

Consider Han van Meegeren, who, beginning in 1933, painted one of the
world's most famous forgeries, "Christ and His Disciples at Emmaus," in the
style of Johannes Vermeer.

Van Meegeren clearly had artistic ability, but his scheming was notable more
for its attention to detail and his ability to imagine a work tantalizing
enough to entice scholars to set aside their nagging doubts and give in to
hope.

First, the technical details. Van Meegeren began with an authentic
17th-century painting by an unknown artist and erased the work with pumice.
He used badger hair brushes and pigments that existed at the time Vermeer
was painting. He tried several methods to dry the painting, which can take
several decades naturally before settling on a synthetic resin dissolved in
alcohol and synthetic lilac oil. This was close enough to Vermeer's linseed
oil.

But van Meegeren's success was as much about wish fulfillment as anything
else. He preyed on the dreams of scholars by mimicking an artist whose work
was rare (only 34 paintings by Vermeer were known to exist in the mid-1930s)
and by giving them a piece from early in the artist's career.

The forgery did not fool everyone, and today, for art scholars, it's
difficult to imagine it fooled anyone - but it did.

"It is a wonderful moment in the life of a lover of art when he finds
himself suddenly confronted with a hitherto unknown painting by a great
master," wrote scholar Abraham Bredius after the painting was revealed.

The work sold in 1937 for 520,000 Dutch guilders ($4.7 million today) and
was donated to the Boijmans van Beuningen Museum in Rotterdam.

The scam nearly cost van Meegeren his life.

After World War II, art scholars began tracing the lineage of looted works.
They traced this so-called Vermeer to van Meegeren and charged him with
collaboration. Rather than accept a death sentence, van Meegeren admitted to
forging dozens of paintings and demonstrated his techniques from his jail
cell in order to prove he had not collaborated with the Nazis.

He died of a heart attack six weeks after his sentencing.

The fate of his painting was finally settled in 1966, when the Mellon
Institute in Pittsburgh studied the residual radioactivity and determined it
was a modern work forgery and not a Vermeer.

Which is why it's at the Bruce Museum.

FAKES AND FORGERIES: THE ART OF DECEPTION is open through Sept. 9. The Bruce
Museum is at 1 Museum Drive in Greenwich. Museum hours are Tuesday through
Saturday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Sunday, 1 to 5 p.m. The museum is closed
Mondays and major holidays. Admission is $7, $6 for seniors and students,
free for children under 5.

Surprise after collection check

An inventory of the Vestlandske Museum of Industrial Art in Bergen resulted
in a shocking discrepancy in the size of their collection.
"There is no doubt that we were surprised," museum director Jorunn Haakestad
told newspaper Bergens Tidende, after the process last year registered all
collection items in a computer database.

The museum believed they had between 20,000-25,000 objects at the facility,
but there are between 33,000-35,000.

"I think that the registration of collections at most other museums in
Norway would provide the same kind of surprise we got," Haakestad said.

At the same time Haakestad confirmed that any possibly dishonest employees
at the museum could have had easy and unchecked access to valuable items,
and that some kinds of theft could have gone undetected for many years.

Earlier this week the newspaper revealed that a large number of important
letter from the University Library collection of former Prime Minister Johan
Ludwig Mowinckel's documents had been stolen.

Police seek clues in P. Buckley Moss heist 
 Approximately 14 P. Buckley Moss prints have been stolen from a Waynesboro
house whose owner has been in a nursing home for over a year. The break-in
was reported in late May when a neighbor noticed a broken window in the back
of the house, according to NBC29. The burglar ransacked the house and took
coins as well as real and costume jewelry.

Some larger prints that couldn't easily be carried out of the house were
left, the News Virginian reports.

Police warn that the thief may have a hard time fencing the popular artist's
work, and pawn shops will be on the lookout for images of feetless geese and
Mennonite moppets.

Vallsquer difundir a trav?s de Internet una p?gina en la que detallan las
obras de arte que les robaron de su colecci?n particular en su casa de Olot
(Girona) la segunda semana de junio. En la web. los familiares piden "ayuda"
a los internautas para poder recuperar todas las obras robadas. 

Se da las circunstancia de que el d?a del robo ?nicamente se llevaron
aquellos objetos relacionados con el arte, lo que hace pensar a la familia
que los ladrones conoc?an la vivienda. 

Entre las 27 pinturas y cuadros substra?dos se encuentran obras de Maurici
Vallsquer, Joaquim Planagum?, Barnadas, Jaume Vilanova o Bosch Pla, entre
otros. Tambi?n se llevaron un diorama de Vallsquer, varios espejos, unas
espadas y hasta unos pendientes que no estaban a la vista. 

Con permiso de los Mossos

En la web http://robatori-olot.blogspot.com detallan a trav?s de fotograf?as
y con el "permiso de los mossos" todos los objetos que les robaron. Marc
Planagum?, nieto del pintor, ha explicado a Europa Press que ya ten?an la
web preparada pero que no la han colgado hasta que la Polic?a auton?mica les
ha dado su "autorizaci?n".

Planagum? tambi?n ha dicho que m?s all? del valor econ?mico su objetivo es
"recuperar" las piezas porque formaban parte de la colecci?n familiar y
tienen un alto valor "sentimental" para todos ellos. 

Maurici Vallsquer naci? en Barcelona el 3 de marzo de 1904 y muri? en Olot
en 1992 a la edad de 88 a?os. A lo largo de su vida vivi? en Barcelona,
Mallorca y Olot y fue un destacado paisajista. Durante su vida expuso sus
obras en Nueva York, Alemania, Suiza, Francia, Espa?a y B?lgica.

Sudan arrests 12 trying to smuggle ancient mummies
Sat 16 Jun 2007, 12:52 GMT
 
[-] Text [+] KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Sudanese authorities have arrested 12
people accused of smuggling ancient antiquities including two entire
mummies, a state news agency said on Saturday.

"The police authorities in Nile state have thwarted an attempt to smuggle
ancient artefacts," the state Sudanese Media Centre said.

It gave no details of the age of the mummies.

 Sudan, home of the ancient Nubian civilisation, has more pyramids than
neighbouring Egypt, but little excavation is done on its archaeological
sites.

Sometimes known as the "Black Pharaohs," Nubian kings ruled Egypt from
roughly 760 B.C. to 660 B.C. Sudan's most viewed pyramids in Merowe in
northern Sudan date from about 300 B.C.

Egypt has demanded museums around the world return its antiquities, which
have been smuggled out over the centuries.

Few people visit Sudan's pyramids and ancient cities, situated mostly north
of Khartoum along the river Nile.

Man who stole famous art gets additional prison time
By Robert Patrick
ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH
06/15/2007

A man caught with famous stolen art - for a second time - was sentenced
Thursday in federal court at St. Louis to 10 more months in federal prison.

Donald R. Rasch, 46, got in trouble again while he was in prison serving a
two-year sentence for stealing more than 130 pieces of fine art, worth up to
$4 million, that belonged to David and Dianne Harter of Florida. 

Rasch and Biron A. Valier worked for a now-defunct Bridgeton storage
facility, and both pleaded guilty in 2005 to taking the art. Some was
recovered, but almost four dozen pieces were still missing. Both men said
they didn't know where the rest was.

But after Rasch had gone to prison, his girlfriend contacted authorities and
said she knew where some of the stolen art could be found.

Investigators recovered 28 pieces, worth about $98,000, from her house and
from the home of a Rasch relative, court documents show.

Officials confronted Rasch, who confessed to hiding the art and lying when
he said he made only one trip to the storage facility to steal art. He also
helped investigators find one more piece.

Rasch pleaded guilty in May to one count of lying to the FBI, and agreed to
pay $38,000 in restitution. A New York art gallery that bought two stolen
Arthur Dove paintings from an Illinois man, who got them from Rasch, gets
$12,000 to reimburse its loss when the FBI seized the pieces. The Illinois
man gets $26,000.

Seventeen pieces of art are still missing.

Scrap metal thieves target churches 
By Sadie Gray 
Published: 17 June 2007 
Thieves are stripping churches of valuable metals at the rate of more than
one church a day to cash in on scrap prices kept high by heavy demand from
China. 

Ecclesiastical Insurance has received 500 claims in the past 14 months,
totalling ?750,000. Many are for repeated thefts from the same churches.

Since 2005, thefts of lead have trebled and copper thefts have multiplied by
10, Ecclesiastical said.

Criminals have stripped entire church roofs, stolen bells, and ripped
lightning conductors from spires by tying them to trucks and driving away,
wrecking historic masonry.

Recycling firms pay about ?900 a tonne for lead and ?2,700 a tonne for
copper.

Small-time criminals have been stealing lead from church roofs for years,
but recent highs in scrap metal prices has caused an explosion in thefts,
said Chris Pitt, of Ecclesiastical.

"We've seen a marked worsening in the situation in the past year. These
aren't opportunists doing this - we had a three-tonne bell taken from
outside a church.

"If they've stolen ?2,000-worth of lead, that can have caused ?50,000-worth
of damage to the church," Mr Pitt said.

Current hotspots include London, Bristol, the West Midlands and Sheffield.

Inspector Stuart Edwards, of South Yorkshire Police, said: "Between April
2006 and April 2007 we've had in the order of 20 attacks on churches. The
crux of the matter is that thieves pay no heed to what type of premises it
is.

"The problem with churches is that they're often isolated so we don't get
people regularly reporting suspicious events to us. If we get a couple of
prosecutions under our belts, it'll act as a deterrent.

"There's a message to get out to the scrap metal dealers themselves, to be
mindful of people coming on to their premises wanting to sell what's quite
clearly lead flashing, who clearly aren't tradespeople or regular
customers."

Ecclesiastical's largest metal theft claim was for ?40,000, Mr Pitt said,
although most were between ?2,000 and ?4,000. But many churches were hit
repeatedly, leading to mounting costs.

Thieves struck at All Saints Church in Heath Town, Wolverhampton, three
times in May, stealing lead flashing, the lightning conductor and ladders.
Because it was under renovation at the time, the church's insurance was
affected and it must cover the cost - expected to be a five-figure sum -
itself.

In October last year, thieves attached the lightning conductor of All Saints
Church, Little Staughton, Bedfordshire, to their vehicle and drove away.
They also brought down the top eight feet of the spire, which destroyed a
gargoyle on its way down. Repairs will cost ?36,000.

In another remarkable theft, a bell was taken from a church in Eastfield,
Northamptonshire.

Mr Pitt said: "Lead is on parts of the church that are inaccessible and hard
to see, so what people notice first is often indentations in the grass after
they've rolled up the lead and thrown it off the roof. Sometimes no one
realises until the roof starts leaking."

The highest-profile recent theft believed to be linked to scrap metal was
that of a two-tonne Henry Moore sculpture stolen in December 2005. It has
never been found.

Man gets jail term for theft of artwork

WAILUKU - A one-year jail term was ordered for a Lahaina man as he was
sentenced Thursday for the theft of artwork from galleries on Front Street
last year.

William Vannatta III, 45, said he was "deeply grateful" for the plea
agreement recommending that he be placed on probation for the crimes.

"I have a lot of regrets," he said. "I'm sorry for the things I did."

Vannatta had pleaded no contest to five counts of second-degree theft of
paintings, sculptures and an autographed guitar from the galleries from last
June to October.

Deputy Public Defender Jon Apo said Vannatta had "cooperated fully" with
police Lt. Don Simpson to recover much of the artwork.

According to court records, the stolen artwork included paintings depicting
John Lennon and Elvis Presley and glass sculptures.

Following terms of the plea agreement, 2nd Circuit Judge Joseph Cardoza
imposed the one-year jail term as part of five years' probation for
Vannatta. He was ordered to pay $940 in restitution for sculptures stolen
from one gallery.
