Indeed -- making a better CGI is a great idea.

But the fact that such innovations came along later supports my point.
I suspect that some of these got less mindshare than they otherwise
would have done (or were seen as inferior to CGI) because:

* The CGI module was core.

* By being called simply CGI, the CGI module gets some kind of
  superiority over all the other modules which have to be
  CGI::Something.

Has Larry yet decreed whether Web will be bundled with Perl 6?

Of course.  But there's a big difference between the attitude of 'let's
do the best we can right now' and 'this is our one chance to do this
right'.

It isn't.  But it is a reason to anticipate the existence of future
developments, and try to be careful not to do anything which makes life
harder for them.
