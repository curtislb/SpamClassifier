As far as NTFS being more reliable than FAT32, I would argue on personal 
experience  that I have had more drives go bad that were running NTFS than 
those running FAT32.
I have owned more drives formatted with FAT32, so I should have experienced 
more FAT32 file system problems, yet I have experienced the opposite.
Now this can be due to mechanical problems un-related to the file system, 
but it is often unclear whether the hard-drive crash was due to an inability 
for the file system being able to repair itself.

FAT32 is also much more likely to be corrupted that NFTS
if you have a BSOD or something, and I never use it for the
windows partition. The reason I suggested FAT32 was
because I thought NTFS was still read only on linux but
Greg pointed out it's now possible

I have had many a FAT32 file corruption over the years
but so far not one NTFS. OMG maybe microsoft did
something fairly decent. hehe
