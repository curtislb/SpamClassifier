Hello sm1lies,

The Registration Tool Prototype Conversion assembly launched today. This assembly competition consists of converting an HTML prototype to a JSP / Servlet application and implementing the Struts Actions layer.

What is it? The Registration Tool allows users to view, register, and select positions for various competition types at TopCoder, including team competitions, individual competitions, coaching positions, and reviewers.  It also tracks a memberï¿½s status with respect to Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA), terms of work, and other documents.  The application will initially be used as the registration interface for assembly competitions, and will later be expanded to others.

* First place pays $8,000
* Second place pays $4,000

There is also a special $200 bonus for making a milestone, payable to ANY team -- not just the first- and second-place winners -- who make at least one milestone and a final submission.

In addition to the prize money, this contest can earn you valuable placement points in the new Digital Run Assembly Cup. Learn more: http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&d1=digital_run&d2=description

Good luck!
