Hi Igor:  I rewrote that driver and had Gene test it and he said it
was working correctly so I checked it in.  I don't have an Express or
any other DECTalk for that matter so I can't test it myself so if what
we now have isn't right then it will take somebody else to hunt down
what isn't working exactly.  I will look at the code again in the next
few days but all I can do is guess at this point.

  Kirk
