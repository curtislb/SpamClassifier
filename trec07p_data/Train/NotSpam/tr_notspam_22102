     As long as they're doing it for money, barter, or any other kind of 
payment, we'll lose.  If businesses had any compassion, they could run 
off a few special assistive products just for the hell of it, not to 
make money, but just to be compassionate.  It's the people who 
absolutely have to make a business out of it, profitable or non-profit, 
that are screwing us.  To *stay* in business, they have to inflate the 
price.  We could all convert to communism, but hello, the government is 
already confiscating the money to pay for our needs anyway.  What's the 
difference?  I don't like it, but there's no other choice.  Life blows 
chunks. <laughs>
