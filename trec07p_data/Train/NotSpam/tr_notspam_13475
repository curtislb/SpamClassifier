I believe what Frank meant was that it's probably better to use a
distribution-free procedure to do the real test of interest (if there is
one) instead of testing for normality, and then use a test that assumes
normality.

I guess the question is, what exactly do you want to do with the outcome
of the normality tests?  If those are going to be used as basis for
deciding which test(s) to do next, then I concur with Frank's
reservation.

Generally speaking, I do not find goodness-of-fit for distributions very
useful, mostly for the reason that failure to reject the null is no
evidence in favor of the null.  It's difficult for me to imagine why
"there's insufficient evidence to show that the data did not come from a
normal distribution" would be interesting.
