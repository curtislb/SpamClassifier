I'm using Etch AMD64 on a new Dell Inspiron 6400.  Unfortunately being the cheapskate I am I decided on an ATI Graphics card.  Most Dells though have the option of an Intel or NVidia card which is well supported under Linux.  Also they come with the option of Intel Pro Wireless 3945ABG also supported well (I'm using it this very moment to send e-mails via a wireless router under Etch).  

The only unfortunate thing is that you'll probably need to install some non-free drivers in my case fglrx for the ATI card and ipw3945 stuff for the wireless.
