+
+=item *
+
+Where should c-level role implementations live? In src/pmc? What naming
+convention should we use for the files? Singleton role goes to rsingleton.pmc?
+
+=item *
+
+Should we create a pmrole keyword like pmclass? And pmr2c to translate them to
+C? How different are classes and roles at the PMC level?
+
+=item *
+
+<particle> pmclass needs a keyword to specify what roles a class is composed
+from.  We're already using 'does', but in an ad hoc way, from what I can see in
+the little docs there are about 'does'.
+
+=item *
+
+<particle> Do c-level roles have custom flags like PMCs? Class PMC has a custom
+flag for 'instantiated', right now it uses a full int, which I think is a waste
+of space. <allison> 8 bits is pretty limited, and IIRC we've already run into
+the limitation. This runs back to Leo's proposal to make PMCs a little more
+flexible, so we wouldn't have to hold all PMCs to the same 8 bits
