Dear Friends,

As you may have seen, Eli Lilly announced in May that it is now
disclosing its charitable and educational contributions, at least in the
United States. Disclosure of pharmaceutical industry funding to
charitable and educational organizations is by no means a complete cure
for the problems related to such sponsorships, but it is a start.

I am writing to ask you to join a sign-on letter asking all other major
pharmaceutical companies to follow Lilly's lead, but to disclose all
contributions on a global basis. (We will also ask PhRMA and the IFPMA
to adopt policies recommending member companies make such disclosures;
and for Lilly to broaden its policy to the entire world (which it says
it is considering).)

For background material on the issue, please see our website, at
<www.pharmadisclose.org>.

The sign-on letter is reproduced below. To add your name to the call,
send your organization's name (or your name and organizational
affiliation, if any, if you would like to sign as an individual), your
mailing address and email address to: <Marcia@essential.org> or
<pharmadisclose@gmail.com>. Please send your endorsement no later than
June 20, 2007.

Best,

Robert Weissman

Dear [Company],

We are writing to urge you to publish a complete list of all of the
charitable and educational grants and gifts made by [Company], its
subsidiaries, affiliates and associated foundations. This list should be
made available on your company website, include the amounts of each
grant and the recipient, and cover grants and gifts made on a global
basis. Such a system of disclosure would impose minimal burdens on your
company, since it must already compile this information, but the
disclosures would have significant public benefits.

There is quite extensive evidence that pharmaceutical industry
charitable and educational grants have been abused to influence public
health and public policy decisions improperly. For example:

* Purportedly educational programs sponsored by industry may improperly
promote drugs for off-label uses.(1)

* Policy think tanks and advocacy groups that receive funding from the
pharmaceutical industry often weigh in on important policy debates --
for example, in op-ed pieces -- without disclosing their industry ties.(2)

* Patient organizations receiving industry support often tout products
sold by corporate donors, but fail to highlight safety concerns. These
groups may also over-promote diseases and drug treatments sold by their
corporate donors.(3) They may lobby for inclusion of products on
government formularies without disclosing their industry ties, and favor
the products of corporate sponsors over others.(4)

* Charitable organizations may be used as a conduit to fund doctors or
their research, circumventing normal disclosure requirements and rules.(5)

Disclosing industry funding to charitable and educational organizations
is by no means a complete cure for these and related problems -- many of
us support much stronger restrictions or outright bans on many industry
sponsorship practices -- but it is a start.

The industry has begun to make some modest moves in the direction of
disclosure. As you know, one major pharmaceutical company, Eli Lilly,
recently began publishing its charitable and educational contributions,
at least in the United States. And the Association of the British
Pharmaceutical Industry's code of practice requires disclosure of
support for patient groups, though not disclosure of the amounts.

It is time now for each company to fully disclose charitable and
educational contribution information, on a global basis.

We look forward to your response.
