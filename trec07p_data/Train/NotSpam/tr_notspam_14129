News.com ran an article earlier in the week talking about the somewhat
[0]strained relationship between newspapers and Google. Google's stance
is firm: 'We don't pay to index news content.' Just the same, newspapers
with an online presence are starting to reconsider their relationship
with Google, the value of linking, and the realities of internet
economics. Talk of paying for content, as well as ongoing court cases,
has observers considering both sides of the issue: "While some in
newspaper circles point to the Belgium court ruling and the content deals
with AP and AFP as a sign Google may be willing to pay for content,
Google fans and bloggers interpreted the news quite differently. To them,
it was obvious that the Belgium group had agreed to settle--even after
winning its court case--because they discovered that they needed Google's
traffic more than the fees that could be generated from news snippets.
Observers note that with newspapers receiving about 25 percent of their
traffic from search engines, losing Google's traffic had to sting."

An anonymous reader writes "Wired is presenting a gallery of artwork that
inspired Weta's collectible rayguns, plus exclusive [0]photos of the
retrofurist sidearms. The article offers more than just images; each
weapon has a description of where they were inspired from, as well as
possible uses. 'In this illustration by Greg Broadmore, a hunter poses
with his latest kill and his elegant retrofurist rifle ... "I started
drawing these things just for fun," says Broadmore. "I did dozens of
designs, all really stylized and Flash Zombie looking. I remember those
black and white serials playing on TV as a kid and the imagery always
stuck with me. Really hokey, but really scary and weird at the same time.
And, of course, if you're a fan of classic rayguns you'll see the
influence of the old toy rayguns. The Buck Rogers disintegrator pistol --
of course directly referenced in Han Solo's blaster in Star Wars -- is
iconic, and that original raygun, along with many others, inspired me
massively.'"

An anonymous reader writes "A New York Times piece looks at a rising
power in the 'new internet bubble' that you may not have heard of before.
The business, an outfit called NameMedia, has made a concerted effort to
[0]quietly purchase vast tracts of 'real estate' on the internet. The
ultimate goal is to provide additional advertising and page views for
content sites. 'Behind this suddenly active business category -- which
includes companies like iREIT in Houston, Marchex in Seattle, and Demand
Media in Santa Monica, Calif. -- is the recognition that not all Internet
users turn to a search engine when they are confused about where to find
something online. Rather, 5 percent to 10 percent of people will simply
type in a name that sounds as if it might suit their needs. The so-called
direct search or direct navigation approach is seldom fruitful for users,
nor has it been particularly profitable for owners of the sites that they
visit. An obscure Web address may have four or so visitors a month, and
perhaps half will click on an ad.'"

mrspin writes "[0]last100 writes: "With an ever greater amount of video
being consumed online, many Internet users are in for a shock. There's a
dirty little secret in the broadband industry: Internet Service Providers
(ISPs) [0]don't have the capacity to deliver the bandwidth that they
claim to offer. One way ISPs attempt to conceal this problem is to place
a cap of say 1GB per-month per user, something which is common in the UK
for many of the lower-cost broadband packages on the market. Considering
that a mere three hours viewing of Joost (the new online video service
from the founders of Skype) would all but use up this monthly allowance,
it's clear that lots of Internet users aren't invited to the party. But
what about those who (like me) pay more for 'unlimited' broadband access?
There shouldn't be a problem, right? Wrong." The article then goes on to
discuss the recent trend of bandwidth throttling based on techniques such
as packet shaping which punishes p2p traffic whether it's legitimate or
not."

[0]Pcol writes "The Washington Post is running a story on the design
process for the Pentagon building and why it [1]ended up with its unusual
shape. In July 1941 with World War II looming, a small group of army
officers met to consider a secret plan to provide a permanent home for
War Department headquarters containing 4 million square feet of office
space and housing 40,000 people. The building that Brig. Gen. Brehon
Burke Somervell, head of the Army's Construction Division, wanted to
build was too large to fit within the confines of Washington DC and would
have to be located across the Potomac River in Arlington. "We want
500,000 square feet ready in six months, and the whole thing ready in a
year," the general said adding that he wanted a design on his desk by
Monday morning. The easiest solution, a tall building, was out because of
pre-war restrictions on steel usage and the desire not to ruin
Washington's skyline. The tract selected had a [2]asymmetrical pentagon
shape bound on five sides by roads or other divisions so the building was
designed to conform to the tract of land. Then with objections that the
new building would block views from Arlington National Cemetery, the
location was moved almost one-half mile south. The building would no
longer be constructed on the five-sided Arlington Farm site yet the team
continued with plans for a pentagon at the new location. In the rush to
complete the project, there was simply no time to change the design."

Linux.com's Joe Barr was recently able to sit down with Professor Eben
Moglen at the San Diego Red Hat Summit and discuss the GPLv3 and what it
means [0]beyond the Microsoft/Novell deal on video. "Professor Moglen
explains briefly about GPLv3's work on globalization of the software
license, preventing harm to others by members of the community, and the
most contentious in earlier drafts, DRM."
