Mark,

Great to have another cage cleaner around :-)  There aren't many of us
at this stage!

<snip splint stuff>

In my (very limited) dealings with splint I too have found problems
with the standard headers, and have used the same options (if only to
make splint get further before it barfs; btw: I'm using Gentoo linux
as well).  I think you're heading in the right direction though.

Awesome!  Go for it!!!  Start making patches (see
http://www.parrotcode.org/docs/submissions.html for help on how to
create patches) and send them to parrotbug@parrotcode.org and we'll
review them and apply your changes.  There is also the file
docs/project/cage_cleaners_guide.pod in the Parrot distro, so if
you're interested there's stuff to do there.  Also, if you do a search
on http://rt.perl.org/rt3//Public/ for "cage" then there's heaps to do
there too :-)

When I have the tuits, yeah, but generally I work on other stuff, so
any help in this department is *greatly* appreciated.

> Does anyone have any interest in this?
I can't speak for everyone, but Parrot is going to be the most
platform independent thing out there so making it as compliant as
possible with every platform/compiler/etc is of interest to the
project as a whole.  So yes, I'd say there's interest :-)

> Does anyone have an objection to it?
None whatsoever.
