3. Deadline Extended for 2007 ATIP Program Participants
4. Tips for Choosing a Tax Preparer
5. Recent IRS Announcements for Small Businesses

1. Stay On Top of Employment Tax Obligations

A quarter or two of un-deposited employment taxes can turn into a cycle of trying to catch up. Before long the liability 

is unmanageable. 

You might consider making smaller deposits more often.  Maybe it would be easier to make a $200-$500 deposit 

every couple of weeks than to save and submit a $2,500 deposit at the end of a quarter. The IRS doesn’t mind as long 

as you have the right amount paid by the deposit due dates. 

Also, if you aren’t already making your deposits electronically, sign up for the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS).  http://www.irs.gov/efile/article/0,,id=98005,00.html

2. Estimated Taxes

Estimated tax is the method used to pay tax on income that is not subject to withholding.  Similar to taxes withheld from wages, it is held in trust on your behalf by the government until you file your return.  

If you are self-employed, a sole proprietor, partner, or S corporation shareholder, you may have to pay estimated tax.  

Estimated tax is used to pay both income tax and self-employment tax, as well as other taxes and amounts reported on your tax return.

If you do not pay enough through withholding or estimated tax payments, you may be charged a penalty. 

IRS.gov http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=110413,00.html has additional information on: 

--Who Must Pay Estimated Tax
--Who Does Not Have To Pay Estimated Tax
--How to Figure Estimated Tax
--When to Pay Estimated Taxes

Whatever your circumstances, using EFTPS http://www.irs.gov/efile/article/0,,id=98005,00.html is the easiest way to pay your federal taxes.

3. Deadline Extended for 2007 ATIP Program Participants

In response to requests from industry members, IRS extended the deadline http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=168216,00.html  for restaurant and beverage businesses to elect to participate in the Attributed Tip Income Program http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=160536,00.html  to June 30. 

The extended deadline only applies to the 2007 calendar year.

Information on the program is available in Publication 1461, Attributed Tip Income Program http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p1461.pdf  and Rev. Proc. 2006-30. http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rp-06-30.pdf 

4. Tips for Choosing a Tax Preparer

The 2007 tax season may be months away, but if you are looking for a tax preparer to do your taxes, choose that preparer wisely. You are legally responsible for what’s on your own tax return - even if prepared by someone else. 

IRS.gov has a few tips for selecting a tax preparer. http://www.irs.gov/individuals/article/0,,id=133088,00.html
