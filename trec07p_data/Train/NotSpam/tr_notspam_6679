Neither do licenses, which are distributed because of necessity, are
extensions (or applications, if you will) of copyright law, and must be
taken as such, like the SC and DFSG do.

This is just one of many possible cases. Someone might want copyleft
terms for their meta-license, and might end up with a license that is
copyrightable, which then in turn needs a license. We can't anticipate
all cases, but your example is no more likely than the next.


Anyway, we're already far beyond what is "practical" and although this
has been interesting for me because I've had the chance to dig a bit
deeper into these documents and concepts, I feel that we're already
"outside the meeting room, discussing in the corridor, lights are being
shut off, everyone else has gone home and the janitor is rattling with
his keychain and giving us meaningful looks as he's making his final
round before locking up for the weekend..."

:)
