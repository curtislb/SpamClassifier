GPL v3 *is* compatible with the OpenSSL (actually the Apache) license 
according to FSF.

I don't particularly like the above, but I don't find it obnoxious, 
particularly because Bacula doesn't do advertising (I don't consider our 
manual as advertising materials), and if we did, I don't see any reason not 
to mention OpenSSL.

I can understand that other people have different feelings about it, but what 
bothers me is that because FSF does not like this kind of clause, they 
declare that the OpenSSL license is not compatible with GPL v2 and thus they 
restrict my rights ...  so much for Free Software !
