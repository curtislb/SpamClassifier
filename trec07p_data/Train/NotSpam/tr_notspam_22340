I hate reformatting patches more than anything else, even more than 80
columns limits. In samba4 we started having a style convention shortly
after the branch was created (not sure we always followed that though).

I am all for setting a style convention, it makes the code much more
readable. And I am ok with the kernel convention (which is roughly what
we have in samba4 and afaics very close to what we use in samba3).

simo.
