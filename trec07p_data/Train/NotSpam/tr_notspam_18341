9:12 PM, 6/11/07, Update: Shuttle mission extended two days; fourth spacewa=
lk added; blanket repair ordered=20

NASA's Mission Management Team decided today to extend the shuttle Atlantis=
' mission by two days and to add a fourth spacewalk Sunday. That will give =
the astronauts enough time to complete their space station assembly tasks a=
nd fix a pulled-up insulation blanket on one of the ship's aft rocket pods.=
 Flight controllers plan to make a decision Tuesday on whether to add the b=
lanket repair to the third or fourth spacewalk.

"Based on our analysis today, we have upped our desire to fix this," said J=
ohn Shannon, chairman of NASA's Mission Management Team. "We were looking a=
t flight history, saying this doesn't look like a big deal. Then you go loo=
k at your analysis tools and say hey, I could really damage the top surface=
 of my structure and I sure don't want to do that. So let's go have a good =
effort to repair it before we come home."

Landing at the Kennedy Space Center now is targeted for around 1:54 p.m. on=
 June 21.

The protruding insulation was spotted by the shuttle astronauts during a ro=
utine post-launch payload bay survey using the shuttle's robot arm. A camer=
a on the arm spotted a triangular 4-inch by 6-inch corner of a two-inch-thi=
ck insulation blanket that was sticking up and bent back. Engineers later c=
oncluded air rushing over the rocket pod during the shuttle 's climb out of=
 the lower atmosphere worked its way into a corner or seam and peeled the b=
lanket back.

The concern is that hot air during re-entry could damage the underlying gra=
phite epoxy structure of the left-side Orbital Maneuvering System rocket po=
d. During the 15 minutes or so of peak heating, the temperatures on the OMS=
 pods reach 700 to 1,000 degree Fahrenheit. While engineers do not view thi=
s as a life-or-death sort of problem - shuttles have safely returned to Ear=
th with much more serious OMS pod damage - there are enough unknowns to pro=
mpt caution.

"We have limitations in our ability to analyze this," Shannon said. "You're=
 going to have a temperature that exceeds that top face coat capability. Ho=
w long it would take to completely erode is very questionable, no one could=
 give me that answer. So the right answer here, the better part of valor, w=
as to go and put it down and secure it."

At the extreme altitude of peak heating, there is little aerodynamic pressu=
re, Shannon said, and simply folding the corner back down and tucking it in=
 might be sufficient. Engineers are still assessing techniques for securing=
 the blanket if necessary.

Engineers used post-Columbia software to model what might happen if the bla=
nket ripped away during the later stages of the descent, when the airflow i=
s stronger, and concluded it would not hit the shuttle.

As it turns out the material used in the blanket will make the fix relative=
ly straight forward.

"If you take this blanket and you pull it up like the wind is hitting it, i=
t'll stay up like that," Shannon said. "It's got some memory. But when you =
push it back down, it stays down. That's something we're kind of counting o=
n. We think the astronauts will be able to go out there and just push this =
right back down. They're working right now different ways to attach it to t=
he blanket that's laying beside it or maybe to attach it to the tile face t=
hat's in front of it."

The repair work is expected to take 90 minutes to two hours to complete. An=
 astronaut, his feet anchored to an extension on the end of the shuttle's r=
obot arm, will be maneuvered back to the left-side OMS pod and push the fla=
p down.

It may be possible to attempt the repair during the crew's third spacewalk =
Friday, but that would require a major push to complete the procedures in t=
ime.

By adding a fourth spacewalk, mission managers can preserve their options f=
or dealing with the blanket and any problems that might develop later this =
week when flight controllers attempt to retract the P6-2B solar array.

The P6 arrays provided the initial power to U.S. modules during the early p=
hases of construction. Now, P6 needs to be retracted, moved out to its perm=
anent location on the left end of the station's main solar power truss and =
re-extended.

Shuttle astronauts ran into major problems retracting the P6-4B solar blank=
et last December and the Atlantis astronauts may have similar problems with=
 the P6-2B wing that is still extended. Flight controllers will begin retra=
ction procedures Wednesday and astronauts Steve Swanson and Patrick Forrest=
er will be standing by to assist if necessary.

Additional P6-2B retraction time is built into a third spacewalk Friday. Wi=
th the decision to fix the pulled-up blanket, NASA managers opted to add a =
fourth spacewalk to ensure enough EVA time is available to handle the repai=
r and any problems that might crop up during the P6 retraction.

"It was a very easy decision," Shannon said.

He added that engineers have completed their initial assessment of Atlantis=
' nose cap, wing leading edge panels and heat shield tiles and found no oth=
er issues that require any attention.
