     Hello all,

     Just joined the list and thought I's say "hello" to everyone. 
Really nice to find a place like this.  I'm a rabid Linux fanatic who 
went blind from diabetic retinopathy in August of '02, and I've been 
pretty much offline ever since.  Finally broke down and upgraded my 
system to support WinXP and quickly heard about SpeakUp for Linux.  I'm 
in the process of looking for a supported speech synth for SpeakUp, so 
I'm still stuck in Windows on a 30 minute Win-Eyes time limit.  I hope 
to soon get Slackware up and running, and soon be able to contribute to 
the SpeakUp effort right along-side everyone.  I'm presently playing 
around with a copy of Oralux and learning the features.  Just need that 
speech synthesizer, and I should be off and running.  Thank you for all 
your efforts.  It is well appreciated.

     Best regards,
         Michael "Foreign White Devil" Ferranti
