My current svn repository uses a patch that I sent to the list about a 
week ago, in which the pge tests would run with gc on if the file 
DEVELOPING existed.  Since I updated to over 18323, 
t/compilers/pge/p5regex/p5rx.t segfaults after test 553.  The 
current_cont in the interp's ctx is null, and results in a segfault 
inside of set_returns.  It doesn't happen on my darwin-ppc system, so I 
don't know how specific it is, and if rebooting will fix it(as often 
happens with the gc bugs in my experience).  But it is failing on my 
freebsd-amd64 system.  Since odds are r18323 just exposed a bug instead 
of adding one, maybe other people will get the crash as well.  You will 
have to remove -G in t/compilers/pge/p5regex.t/p5rx.t to get it to 
fail, as with -G it succeeds(and with -t too).

I've learned a lot lately about how to use gdb, and all I've come to 
learn is that if 
interp->ctx.state->current_cont->obj.u._ptrs._struct_val is null, 
parrot isn't happy, of course that's with macro expansion, and that 
getting the level of debugging information I'd like to be able to write 
little tools to process an analyze it better isn't easy.
