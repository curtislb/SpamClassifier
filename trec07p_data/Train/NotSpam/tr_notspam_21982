Many thanks for your attention.
I checked more closely the licenses related to OpenSSl and Trolltech
which I found within related Debian packages I install to build my own pack=
age=20
(please find both licenses attached).
My personal feeling is that they looks fine.

Maybe I should simply complete my first copyright file by adding licenses f=
rom=20
OpenSSL and Trolltech (I repeat: both present in their respective Debian=20
packages) ?
I suppose I can rely on the fact that because such licenses are already=20
present in other debian packages I can build my own with same licenses.=20
Correct ?

Many thanks for confirmation / correction.

Bye,
Bruno
