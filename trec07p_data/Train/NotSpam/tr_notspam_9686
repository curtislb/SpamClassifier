First, don't email me directly if you're also sending it to beginners@perl.org.

Second, if you've been "repeating it", it's more and more likely that people
are now ignoring you, even if you change your post.

Third, if you aren't able to understand the help you're getting, and that's
why you're "repeating it", then it might be time to go hire someone instead of
trying to do it yourself.

I did not look at the rest of your post.
