Any pattern that can match nothing (a so-called null pattern) will
split a string on nothing leaving you with a list of characters. ' '
and \s+ matches all consecutive white space, so they are not null
patterns and split on the matched value (whitespace).

#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;

my $str = "abc def ghi";
print join(",", split //, $str),"\n";
print join(",", split /(?:ABC)*/, $str),"\n";
print join(",", split /|/, $str),"\n";

print join(",", split " ", $str),"\n";
print join(",", split /\s+/, $str),"\n";

a,b,c, ,d,e,f, ,g,h,i
a,b,c, ,d,e,f, ,g,h,i
a,b,c, ,d,e,f, ,g,h,i
abc,def,ghi
abc,def,ghi
