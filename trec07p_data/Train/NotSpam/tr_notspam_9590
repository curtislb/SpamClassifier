05:45 p.m., 05/11/07, Update: Hail damage repair work virtually complete; A=
tlantis, external tank cleared for rollout=20

The shuttle Atlantis' hail-damaged external fuel tank has been repaired, NA=
SA officials said today, clearing the shuttle for rollout to launch pad 39A=
 next week. Blastoff on a long-delayed space station assembly mission is ta=
rgeted for June 8.

"I'm really pleased to say we have effectively completed the repairs on the=
 external tank," shuttle Program Manager Wayne Hale told reporters during a=
 teleconference today. "I think the team that worked on the external tank a=
cross the country, we're really proud of what they have done. ... It's just=
 an outstanding effort on the parts of hundreds and hundreds of people."

Rollout to the launch pad is scheduled to begin at 4 a.m. on Wednesday, May=
 16. But launch Director Mike Leinbach said if work to tear down external t=
ank scaffolding and other preparations go well, the trip to the pad could m=
ove up one day to Tuesday.

NASA managers had hoped to launch Atlantis on mission STS-117, the first of=
 five planned 2007 shuttle flights, March 15. But during a freak storm that=
 thundered over the launch pad on Feb. 26, the shuttle's external tank was =
blasted by hail, suffering thousands of pits and gouges in its foam insulat=
ion. Wind gusts reached 62 knots and hail up to 1.5 inches in diameter was =
found at the pad.

Most of the damage was restricted to the upper liquid oxygen section of Atl=
antis' tank. Only a handful of dings were found lower down on the hydrogen =
section and while two dozen heat shield tiles on the orbiter were scraped b=
y hail that worked its way behind weather protection panels, detailed inspe=
ctions show the ship's critical carbon composite wing leading edge panels a=
nd nose cap were undamaged.

But the hail damage to the foam on the top of the tank was severe and Atlan=
tis had to be hauled off the pad and moved back to the Vehicle Assembly Bui=
lding for repairs.

"I'll never forget the day of the hail storm itself and then the first time=
 I saw the external tank in the VAB," Leinbach reflected today. "I was real=
ly wondering if we were going to be able to fix this tank or not."

John Chapman, external tank program manager at NASA's Marshall Space Flight=
 Center in Huntsville, Ala., said today the hail storm caused more than 4,2=
00 individual dings, dents, pits and gouges to the foam insulation.

Of that total, between 1,400 and 1,500 were tightly clustered at the very t=
ip of the tank near its carbon composite nose cap. Rather than make individ=
ual repairs in that area, a broad area of foam was sanded down to eliminate=
 the pits and then filled in with sprayed-on insulation. That fresh insulat=
ion was then milled to the proper slope and to an acceptable thickness by a=
 cleverly engineered "pencil sharpener" device that rotated about the top o=
f the tank.

Of the remaining damage sites, 449 were clustered together on the side of t=
he oxygen tank and repaired with a second large-area spray. Another 1,038 p=
its and gouges were fixed using a pourable foam known as "PDL" and 889 dent=
s were fixed by simply sanding them down using a "sand-and-blend" technique=
. Another 412 sites were so minor no repairs were required.

To make sure the required repairs could stand up to the aerodynamic and the=
rmal rigors of launch, engineers re-assessed the flight performance of past=
 PDL repairs, simulated damage sites using steel balls to impart hail-like =
crush forces and then subjected repairs to a hot-gas wind tunnel at Marshal=
l.

"We were able to place simulated repairs in close proximity to each other t=
o study the effect of multiple repairs, both side by side and downstream fr=
om each other," Chapman said. "In fact, we even developed a drop test capab=
ility to be able to drop steel balls that would represent the amount of kin=
etic energy the hail stones would have ... and then put that into the hot-g=
as facility and see how it performs."

The goal, Hale said, was assurance no dangerous debris would fall off the t=
ank during ascent.

"We have gone through an extensive set of tests and analyses with the repai=
rs that have been done in these test facilities to ensure they won't releas=
e debris and all our testing today indicates that will not happen," he said.

During the first 110 seconds of ascent, atmospheric friction raises the tan=
k's temperature to some 650 degrees in some places and heating continues th=
roughout the climb to space. Along with thermal concerns, foam debris falli=
ng off the tank could threaten a Columbia-type impact to Atlantis' heat shi=
eld.

"As you accelerate this vehicle supersonically in the lower atmosphere, you=
 build up quite a bit of heat, several hundred degrees," Hale said. "But yo=
u increase in temperature all the way up and even in second stage, when you=
 are almost at orbital altitudes, you continue to put heat in.

"The point is, we have to protect both the thermal environment, in other wo=
rds you cannot allow those temperatures to get to the aluminum-lithium subs=
trate, which would weaken the metal, nor can you allow a significant amount=
 of foam to come off," he said. "The foam up in the forward part of the tan=
k, because it does get that warm, does have an ablation process, so you los=
e at the molecular level small pieces of foam, but when we're talking about=
 debris that can cause damage, again, the goal is not to have any of that. =
That's the kind of testing that was done at the hot-gas facility at Marshal=
l to ensure these repairs don't liberate any significant amount of foam, ev=
en at the elevated temperatures."

No previous PDL repairs have ever failed in flight. While there is some sli=
ght additional risk flying the repaired tank, Hale said, it is not consider=
ed significant.

The hail storm, Chapman said, "left the external tank team with a tremendou=
s amount of work to do. This team has been essentially working 24/7 since t=
he storm, doing engineering analysis, testing and repair of the tank. In my=
 estimation, they have done a fantastic job. This has truly been unique. We=
've had hail damage before, but never to this magnitude."

Said Leinbach: "The team has come through with flying colors and gotten a c=
ompletely flight worthy tank put together. ... We are essentially done with=
 all the repairs on the tank now."

But Chapman cautioned that shuttle watchers should be prepared for a somewh=
at strange-looking tank when Atlantis heads for the pad next week. The foam=
 used for the large-area sprays and the PDL-type repairs is a much lighter =
color than the insulation sprayed on at the factory.

"Your mind will have a hard time convincing your eyes there are no surface =
discontinuities where you see changes in color," he said. "It's very much l=
ike a car that has had body and fender work but hasn't had the primer spray=
ed on it yet. No matter how much you look at it and feel it after you've ha=
d that work done on a car, your eye has trouble recognizing the fact that i=
t's going to be nice and smooth. And that's the situation we have with this=
 tank. But I promise you, it's absolutely ready to go."

Launch is targeted for 7:37:56 p.m. on June 8. NASA plans to hold a two-day=
 flight readiness review May 30 and 31 to assess the status of launch prepa=
rations and to set an official launch date. Assuming a rollout to the pad o=
n May 16, engineers will only have three contingency days between then and =
June 8 to deal with unexpected problems.
