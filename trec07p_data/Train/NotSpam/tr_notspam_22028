This is getting annoying....

It might be useful if objectorb.com would actually provide some  
reason for delivery beyond "Delivery time expired".
Considering the string '***SPAM***' appears to be something I might  
find in SpamAssassin, and some people are starting to apply smtp  
rejections to spam filtering.  I've been reading a lot about this on  
the SA list.  I think it can be a safe conclusion that this is a  
"bad" idea.

your spam filter has me targeted as a false positive for spam.
But since you NEVER accept delivery you'll never know any better.
And just to be really annoying, you keep throwing temporary failures  
at me instead of real failures.
Now you cost me resources, the mailing list resources, and there's no  
way out of this pattern.

I would like to thank you for this display of failure mode for this  
type of implementation.  This demonstrates the short comings of this  
approach.  Thank you for the demonstration. Now are you going to be  
able to do anything about this to prevent the problem from continuing  
in the future?
