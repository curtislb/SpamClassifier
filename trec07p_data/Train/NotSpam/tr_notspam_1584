URS

Here's a note from Troy Roberts on Saturday's 48 Hours Mystery, THE PUPPET =
MASTER:=20

"It was an attack so brazen that people in Boca Raton, Florida still talk a=
bout it ten years after the fact. In October 1997, 31-year-old Heather Gros=
sman and her husband, John, were fired on in their car at an intersection i=
n broad daylight. It was clearly an attempted execution of a wealthy and so=
cially prominent couple. The bullet that struck John only grazed him, but a=
nother bullet severed Heather' spinal cord, leaving her a quadriplegic. Tod=
ay, she is still confined to a wheelchair. And there is no chance of rehabi=
litation. Of course, the question on everyone's mind was who would want to =
kill this attractive mother of three and her second husband? Who would orch=
estrate and then carry out this drive-by shooting... and why? In quick orde=
r investigators found the shooter and three other men who confessed about t=
heir roles in the scheme. They were drug addicts and petty thieves. Surpris=
ingly, they didn't know Heather Grossman or her husband. And they weren't l=
ooking to rob the couple. During interrogation all four men told the same s=
tory. They were given orders to kill Heather Grossman. As investigators kep=
t digging, the murder for hire plot began unraveling and all the evidence s=
eemed to lead to one conclusion. It would take nearly a decade for this mys=
tery to be resolved... and for the architect behind this devastating shooti=
ng to be brought to justice. You will hear from everyone involved in this e=
xplosive case... the victim, the shooter and the person who was convicted f=
or pulling the strings... in the next 48 Hours Mystery."=20

      31-year-old Heather Grossman and her husband, John, were fired on in =
