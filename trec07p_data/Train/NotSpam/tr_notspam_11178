There's no such license. You probably mean the "GNU General Public
License, version 2 or, at your option, any later version".

This is an unreasonable requirement; the recipient may have no means
of satisfying this, but your license terms demand they do so anyway.

It also contradicts the GNU GPL: you're placing an extra restriction
on the recipient which isn't already in the GPL. This makes the work
unredistributable, because no redistributor can satisfy both the GPL
and your extra restriction.

> Credit must be give to the original author

Fine; this is already part of the GNU GPL version 2.

This is an extra restriction, and has exactly the same problem as
discussed above.

It currently is self-contradictory, which means no recipient can
distribute it at all.
