<b>TONIGHT ON SHOWBIZ TONIGHT - CNN HEADLINE PRIME 11pm
ET/PT</b>

<b>A PARIS HILTON SMACKDOWN!</B>
One of Hollywood's most powerful mothers gives Paris a hard
reality check about going to jail. And even Patty Hearst has
some choice words for Paris! Yes, that Patty Hearst: the
newspaper heiress, who was kidnapped, then joined her captors
to help their cause! The inside story on TV's most provocative
entertainment news show.

<b>WILL JAIL TIME REALLY CHANGE PARIS?</B>
Okay, so she's supposed to spend up to 45-days in the slammer.
But will making license plates really give Paris license to
change? A guy who has followed every dirty detail, every
Hilton family scandal doesn't think so. "House of Hilton"
author Jerry Oppenheimer is right here with his surprising
thoughts on whether jail will really change Paris.

<b>CELEBRITIES WHO NEED TO "LIVE THE TRUTH"</B>
Famed TV Psychiatrist Dr. Keith Ablow has some very powerful
advice for stars who are in trouble -- yes, we're talking about
you Paris Hilton, David Hasselhoff, Alec Baldwin and Britney
Spears. Dr. Ablow reveals why they need to acknowledge their
issues, and what they need to turn their lives around.

<b>MUDLE OSMOND'S PAINFUL DECISION</b>
Showbiz Tonight goes one-on-one with the singing star, who
reveals what she went through while deciding to end her 20-year
marriage and opens up about her battle with depression. Her
emotional interview, only on Showbiz Tonight.

<b>WHY WE THINK WE KNOW STARS SO WELL</B>
Showbiz Tonight investigates how we connect to celebrities --
just why do we feel we know them on a personal level? It's
amazing how much we know about their personal lives, right?
Sometimes we feel like they are our best friends. It's a
