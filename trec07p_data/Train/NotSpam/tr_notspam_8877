When the celebrities and politicians who claim to care passionately 
about the issue get down to my level, I'll consider taking them 
seriously.

In the meantime, I'll laugh at their hypocrisy as well as their 
transparent treachery (Medicine Show Al selling his Carbon Offsets 
Elixir).

Remember, I'm old enough to remember the scientific hysteria about the 
coming, unstoppable, inevitable Ice Age.
