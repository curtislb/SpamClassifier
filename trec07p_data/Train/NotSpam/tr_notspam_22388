Hi,
Sorry to take so long to reply, I was travelling last week. Thanks for
your
suggestions. Actually in this case contrast and predict gave the same
result,
and what I was looking at was the correct odds from the model. 

What is still confusing me is the 1st part of my question,
looking for a trend in odds ratios. From what I understand
testing the interaction:
fit1<-glmD(survived ~ as.numeric(Covariate)+Therapy +
confounder,myDat,X=TRUE, Y=TRUE, family=binomial())
fit2<-glmD(survived ~ as.numeric(Covariate)*Therapy +
confounder,myDat,X=TRUE, Y=TRUE, family=binomial()) 
lrtest(fit1,fit2)

Would be effectively testing for a trend in odds ratios? 
Do I have to fiddle with contrasts to make sure I am testing the correct
parameter?

Thanks
Nicholas
