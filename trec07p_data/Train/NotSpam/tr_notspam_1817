Hi,

I am ready to submit a patch to the create-service / delete service
addition.

I can bzr push my branch to somewhere accessible for review - but I
don't know any public apache server that is willing to host my branch (I
don't have one here).

Is there any such common place? 

I can just send the sources, as attachments, to the mailing list, but I
have changes several files and I sense it would not be very convenient.

Regards, Danny.
