9:17 AM, 6/11/07, Update: Astronauts gear up for spacewalk, solar array ins=
tall=20

The Atlantis astronauts are gearing up to attach a 36,000-pound solar array=
 truss segment to the international space station today. Once the stowed ar=
rays are in place, astronauts Jim Reilly and Danny Olivas plan to stage a s=
ix-and-a-half-hour spacewalk to make critical electrical connections and re=
move a variety of launch locks and restraints to prepare the new solar blan=
kets for extension Tuesday.

Reilly and Olivas spent the night sealed up in the space station's Quest ai=
rlock module as part of a new "camp out" procedure. The airlock's pressure =
was lowered from 14.2 pounds per square inch to 10.2 psi to help the spacew=
alkers purge nitrogen from their blood and prevent the bends when working i=
n their 5-psi spacesuits.

"Flight day four is really the big day where station is going to take on a =
new look," said Kelly Beck, lead space station flight director. "When the c=
rew wakes up on flight day four, they're going to begin their robotics and =
EVA preparation activities. The airlock will be repressurized, that'll allo=
w JR and Danny to get out, do their morning routine, grab some breakfast, g=
o back inside and then they'll be assisted ... to get them suited up. In th=
e meantime, while they're getting ready for their spacewalk, Bru (shuttle p=
ilot Lee Archambault) and Suni (station astronaut Sunita Williams) will be =
performing their robotic operations to install the truss."

The $367 million S3/S4 truss segment was pulled out of Atlantis' cargo bay =
shortly after docking Sunday and "parked" overnight on the end of the space=
 station's arm. This morning, working inside the Destiny laboratory module,=
 Archambault and Williams will use the Canadian arm to move S3/S4 up to the=
 right end of the station's main power truss, a segment known as S1 (an ori=
ginally planned S2 segment is no longer in the station architecture).

"On the morning of flight day 4 we=92re going to start our space station ro=
botic arm operations by performing an automated maneuver, takes about 40 or=
 so minutes, to put it in a pre-install position which is approximately a m=
eter and a half from the S1 truss," Archambault said. "In between that mete=
r and a half and actually installing it, we=92re going to pause for a few m=
oments at around 45 centimeters, to allow our Space Vision System to go ahe=
ad and give me a an updated depiction of my exact position with respect to =
the S1 truss, and be able to install this thing within a one or two centime=
ter tolerance."

The Space Vision System uses television cameras and powerful software to me=
asure the precise locations of large black dots attached to the truss eleme=
nts. The SVS software computes the relative positions of the dots to give t=
he arm operator very precise distance and orientation information. Temperat=
ure effects can cause distortions of up to five inches and misalignments of=
 1 to 2 degrees. The SVS helps compensate for any such effects.

Once S1 and S3 are in close proximity, a large claw on the S1 truss will ro=
tate around a capture bar on the S3 segment to pull the two together. Four =
motorized bolts on S1 then will drive into attachment fittings on S3, firml=
y locking the two truss elements together.

At that point, Reilly and Olivas, now suited up in the Quest airlock, will =
float out into space and begin the first of two critical spacewalks to hook=
 up and activate S3/S4.

For identification, Reilly's call sign is EV-1 and his suit features red st=
ripes around the legs. Olivas is EV-2 and his suit has no markings. Here is=
 an updated timeline of today's activities (in EDT and mission elapsed time=
):

The S3 truss segment features the right-side solar alpha rotary joint, or S=
ARJ, which is equipped with two redundant motors that drive a large gear to=
 slowly spin the outboard solar arrays so they can stay roughly face on to =
the sun as the station flies through each 90 minute orbit. Power from the a=
rrays, along with data and computer commands, passes through the center of =
the SARJ without regard to orientation.

Before the SARJ can be activated, both motors, called drive lock assemblies=
, must be manually engaged and then precisely positioned by flight controll=
ers to ensure the drive teeth mesh properly with the main gear. Braces must=
 be positioned, launch locks and thermal shrouds removed, along with a keel=
 pin used to help mount the S3/S4 truss segments in the shuttle's cargo bay=
. Work to rig the SARJ for operation will be spread over two spacewalks.

The S4 segment features two solar array wings folded into shallow "blanket =
boxes" for launch. The mast canisters and blanket boxes must be deployed an=
d restraints removed before the arrays can be deployed Tuesday, stretching =
some 240 feet from tip to tip. The blankets are extended by a self-erecting=
 central masts made up of 31 "bays," each one measuring about 40 inches dee=
p. Boeing is the prime contractor for the S3/S4 truss segment while Lockhee=
d Martin built the included SAWS.

"First thing that they'll be doing is mate the umbilical connections to pro=
vide power and commands to the components on the truss and also receive dat=
a from those components," Beck said. "The next thing they'll be doing is pr=
eparing the solar arrays for deploy. They'll first release the restraints s=
o that the mast canisters, the circular canisters that house the masts, the=
 central structural member, they'll deploy those into position and then the=
y'll release the restraints on the boxes containing the solar array blanket=
s and they'll swing those out into position in preparation for deploy the f=
ollowing day.

"The crew will also release the restraints on the radiator so it can be dep=
loyed later on in the EVA," she said. "They will start the preparation task=
s for the solar alpha rotary joint. They'll be repositioning four struts th=
at provide additional structural integrity to maintain, to take the on orbi=
t loads. They'll also be positioning one of the drive lock assemblies, this=
 is the mechanism that rotates the joint and also locks the joint when it b=
ecomes operational. And they'll start to remove the launch locks. So they'l=
l get a good head start getting the SARJ prepped for its operational state."

Reilly will exit the Quest airlock module first, making his way across a sp=
ur to the S0 truss atop the Destiny module and from there out to the S1 seg=
ment where he will hook up two 85-foot-long safety tethers. At that point, =
Olivas will venture outside.

"Now the way it works out in our EVA is that Jim Reilly kind of has all the=
 real estate on the front side of the truss segment, and I have all the rea=
l estate on the back side," Olivas said. "One of the first things that happ=
ens after the installation has occurred, we have to basically start putting=
 keep-alive power to all the subsystems on S3/S4."

Reilly will make the electrical connections between S1 and S3, hooking up s=
ix cables near the upper part of the S1/S3 interface and seven in a lower u=
tility tray.

"While Jim Reilly takes care of that, my primary responsibility will be to =
start to get the solar array blanket boxes in from their stowed configurati=
on, get them ready for the deployed configuration. We have a variety of res=
traints on those boxes that we'll have to pop off and get them ready. I'll =
do that for both the front side and the back side, the 1A and the 3A side.

"After that's complete my next major task is to go down and reconfigure the=
 photovoltaic radiator, which is just a giant radiator that radiates the he=
at being generated by the electrical power system on the S4 segment out to =
space. My job is to go down there on the bottom side of the truss, the nadi=
r side of the truss. A variety of cinches and winches keep it in the compre=
ssed configuration. My job is to get those fully deployed, get them opened =
up, and get it configured so that it can be commanded into the deployed con=
figuration."

Toward the end of the spacewalk, the astronauts inside the station will sen=
d commands to deploy the folding radiator needed to keep the S4 array's ele=
ctronics cool during normal operation. The radiator measures 44 feet long a=
nd 12 feet wide.

Overnight, flight controllers will send commands to deploy the new arrays o=
ne mast bay to help warm the blankets up. On Tuesday the astronauts will fu=
lly extend both panels.

Tue 06:30 AM...03...10...52...Flight director update on NTV<BR>
<BR>
The S3 truss segment features the right-side solar alpha rotary joint, or S=
ARJ, which is equipped with two redundant motors that drive a large gear to=
 slowly spin the outboard solar arrays so they can stay roughly face on to =
the sun as the station flies through each 90 minute orbit. Power from the a=
rrays, along with data and computer commands, passes through the center of =
the SARJ without regard to orientation.<BR>
<BR>
Before the SARJ can be activated, both motors, called drive lock assemblies=
, must be manually engaged and then precisely positioned by flight controll=
ers to ensure the drive teeth mesh properly with the main gear. Braces must=
 be positioned, launch locks and thermal shrouds removed, along with a keel=
 pin used to help mount the S3/S4 truss segments in the shuttle's cargo bay=
. Work to rig the SARJ for operation will be spread over two spacewalks.<BR>
<BR>
The S4 segment features two solar array wings folded into shallow &quot;bla=
nket boxes&quot; for launch. The mast canisters and blanket boxes must be d=
eployed and restraints removed before the arrays can be deployed Tuesday, s=
tretching some 240 feet from tip to tip. The blankets are extended by a sel=
f-erecting central masts made up of 31 &quot;bays,&quot; each one measuring=
 about 40 inches deep. Boeing is the prime contractor for the S3/S4 truss s=
egment while Lockheed Martin built the included SAWS.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;First thing that they'll be doing is mate the umbilical connections t=
o provide power and commands to the components on the truss and also receiv=
e data from those components,&quot; Beck said. &quot;The next thing they'll=
 be doing is preparing the solar arrays for deploy. They'll first release t=
he restraints so that the mast canisters, the circular canisters that house=
 the masts, the central structural member, they'll deploy those into positi=
on and then they'll release the restraints on the boxes containing the sola=
r array blankets and they'll swing those out into position in preparation f=
or deploy the following day.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The crew will also release the restraints on the radiator so it can b=
e deployed later on in the EVA,&quot; she said. &quot;They will start the p=
reparation tasks for the solar alpha rotary joint. They'll be repositioning=
 four struts that provide additional structural integrity to maintain, to t=
ake the on orbit loads. They'll also be positioning one of the drive lock a=
ssemblies, this is the mechanism that rotates the joint and also locks the =
joint when it becomes operational. And they'll start to remove the launch l=
ocks. So they'll get a good head start getting the SARJ prepped for its ope=
rational state.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Reilly will exit the Quest airlock module first, making his way across a sp=
ur to the S0 truss atop the Destiny module and from there out to the S1 seg=
ment where he will hook up two 85-foot-long safety tethers. At that point, =
Olivas will venture outside.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Now the way it works out in our EVA is that Jim Reilly kind of has al=
l the real estate on the front side of the truss segment, and I have all th=
e real estate on the back side,&quot; Olivas said. &quot;One of the first t=
hings that happens after the installation has occurred, we have to basicall=
y start putting keep-alive power to all the subsystems on S3/S4.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Reilly will make the electrical connections between S1 and S3, hooking up s=
ix cables near the upper part of the S1/S3 interface and seven in a lower u=
tility tray.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;While Jim Reilly takes care of that, my primary responsibility will b=
e to start to get the solar array blanket boxes in from their stowed config=
uration, get them ready for the deployed configuration. We have a variety o=
f restraints on those boxes that we'll have to pop off and get them ready. =
I'll do that for both the front side and the back side, the 1A and the 3A s=
ide.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;After that's complete my next major task is to go down and reconfigur=
e the photovoltaic radiator, which is just a giant radiator that radiates t=
he heat being generated by the electrical power system on the S4 segment ou=
t to space. My job is to go down there on the bottom side of the truss, the=
 nadir side of the truss. A variety of cinches and winches keep it in the c=
ompressed configuration. My job is to get those fully deployed, get them op=
ened up, and get it configured so that it can be commanded into the deploye=
d configuration.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Toward the end of the spacewalk, the astronauts inside the station will sen=
d commands to deploy the folding radiator needed to keep the S4 array's ele=
ctronics cool during normal operation. The radiator measures 44 feet long a=
nd 12 feet wide.<BR>
<BR>
Overnight, flight controllers will send commands to deploy the new arrays o=
ne mast bay to help warm the blankets up. On Tuesday the astronauts will fu=
lly extend both panels.<BR>
