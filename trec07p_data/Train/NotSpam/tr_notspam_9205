Thanks for pointing this out! (And if I had astutely done
help.search("marginal") I would have found it).

That is probably a fair point (real-life situations where both
margins are objectively fixed are probably sparse, to the point
where it may almost be worth collecting them as an "exhibition").

But then Bingshan Li is faced with the issue that the power
(given the odds-ratio) is then dependent on one of the cell
probabilities as a "nuisance parameter". This of course can
be eliminated by conditioning on the total number of successes
over the dimension whose marginals are fixed; but then we are
in effect back to the Fisher Exact Test, whose power is a function
of the odds-ratio alone.

I'm still with Duncan Murdoch, in that what's meant by "power"
in this case depends very much on what you mean by "alternative
hypothesis".

Best wishes to all,
Ted.
