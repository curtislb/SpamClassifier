Why don't you try it?!

It wouldn't work because $fileName would end up with either a true or a
false value depending on whether the regex matched. To get the captured
string put the regex in list context:

  my ($fileName) = $path =~ /.*\/(.+)$/;

But it would still fail if there was no slash in the $path string. You
may want to use the slightly simpler

  my ($name) = $path =~ m|([^/]+)$|;

which just grabs all the characters at the end of the string that aren't
slashes, and works whether or not there is a path as well as a file name
in the string.

Cheers,

Rob
