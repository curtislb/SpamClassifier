6:50 PM, 6/4/07, Update: Astronauts arrive at KSC for final preparations=20

The crew of shuttle Atlantis flew to the Kennedy Space Center today for fin=
al preparations before blastoff Friday on a long-delayed space station asse=
mbly mission. Arriving in two waves aboard T-38 jet trainers, the astronaut=
s took a moment to greet reporters at the Shuttle Landing Facility around 6=
:45 p.m.

"It's great to be down here in Florida," said commander Rick Sturckow. "We =
appreciate this great weather you got for us today to fly in here. If you c=
an just get some weather like this for us on Friday evening, we'll apprecia=
te that, too.

"The crew is very excited to be in Florida. We've spent a long time trainin=
g for this mission. As you know, we had a little bit of a setback, we were =
supposed to go in March. We especially appreciate all the great work that w=
as done on ET-124, our external tank. ... We just flew by the launch pad on=
 the way in here. It looks great."

Running three months late because of hail damage to the shuttle's external =
fuel tank insulation, Atlantis' crew plans to deliver and install a $367 mi=
llion set of solar arrays and a powerful rotary joint to help them track th=
e sun. They also plan to complete the retraction of another set of arrays s=
o it can be moved as required later this year.

Three spacewalks are planned and the crew is prepared to stage a fourth, su=
pplies permitting, if they run into problems retracting the P6-2B solar arr=
ay wing.

The countdown for shuttle mission STS-117 is scheduled to begin at 9 p.m. T=
uesday, setting up a launch attempt at 7:38:02 p.m. Friday. NASA's Spacefli=
ght Meteorology Group has not yet released a launch forecast, but the Natio=
nal Weather Service in nearby Melbourne predicts partly cloudy skies and a =
30 percent chance of scattered showers and thunderstorms Friday, decreasing=
 to 20 percent Friday night.

If all goes well, engineers will pump liquid hydrogen and oxygen aboard the=
 orbiter Wednesday evening to power the ship's three electricity producing =
fuel cells. NASA's mission management team will meet Friday morning to asse=
ss launch processing and the weather. If no major problems develop, the shu=
ttle's huge external fuel tank will be loaded with a half-million gallons o=
f liquid hydrogen and oxygen starting around 9:42 a.m.

Sturckow and his crewmates are scheduled to suit up and head for pad 39A a =
few minutes before 4 p.m. Friday to strap in for launch.

Today's crew arrival kicks off a busy week of space activity. Aboard the in=
ternational space station, Expedition 15 commander Fyodor Yurchikhin and fl=
ight engineer Oleg Kotov are gearing up for a six-hour spacewalk Wednesday =
to complete the installation of micrometeoroid shields on the Zvezda comman=
d module.

Yurchikhin and Kotov installed five panels during a spacewalk last week and=
 another 12 are to be installed Wednesday. The spacewalk is scheduled to be=
gin at 10:30 a.m.
