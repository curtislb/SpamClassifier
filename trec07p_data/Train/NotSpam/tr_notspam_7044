Lou Dobbs Tonight
Wednesday May 2, 2007

Make sure to join us again at 8 p.m. ET for a Lou Dobbs Tonight
special report, "Broken Borders." We'll be live in Hazleton,
Pennsylvania for a town hall meeting to discuss the issue of
illegal immigration. Hazleton Mayor Lou Barletta, President of
the National Border Patrol Council, T.J. Bonner, President and
General Counsel of MALDEF, John Trasvina and National Executive
Director of LULAC, Brent Wilkes join us.

Tonight, Democrats in Congress rethink their political strategy
after President Bush’s veto of the war spending bill. What will
this mean for the conduct of the war in Iraq?

U.S. taxpayers are footing the bill for the millions of illegal
aliens living in America.  While illegal aliens are given free
medical care and education they are also able to open bank
accounts in this country, apply for mortgages, licenses,
insurance, and in some states pay in state tuition rates for a
college education. Tonight, we’ll be taking a look at why
thousands of illegal aliens took to the streets across America
when they are living the life most U.S. citizens cannot enjoy.


The Economic Policy Institute released a new report on the
staggering losses of American jobs due to the U.S.’s
skyrocketing trade deficit with China. The Economic Policy
Institute’s study found that America’s failed U.S. trade
policies and widening trade deficit with China has resulted in
the displacement of more than 2 million U.S. jobs. We’ll have
more on that tonight.

And, the Food and Drug Administration’s Commissioner testified
before the House Oversight Committee concerning the recent
revelations that America’s food safety is at risk. Budgets have
been slashed and inspections are sporadic at a time when food
imports are at an all time high. We’ll have a full report
tonight.

We’ll also have the latest updates on the trial of Chi Mak, the
naturalized American citizen and electrical engineer charged
with conspiring to smuggle American navy secrets to China.

Visit http://cnn.com/loudobbstonight to read Lou’s
latest commentary on why May Day was a peculiar choice for
illegal immigration demonstrations.

Lou Dobbs lays out his manifesto to save the middle class in
his new book, “War on the Middle Class: How the Government, Big
Business, and Special Interest Groups Are Waging War on the
American Dream and How to Fight Back.” War on the Middle Class
is now on sale in bookstores near you and on Amazon.com and
BarnesandNoble.com.
