Hello sm1lies,

The Corrections Implementation and Corrections Data Issues assembly competitions are now open for registration. 

These two assemblies are part of an application designed to automate the correction of data stored in a large data warehouse.

Prize info:

- Corrections Implementation:

* 1st place is $7,000
* 2nd place is $3,500 
 

- Corrections Data:

* 1st place is $12,000
* 2nd place is $6,000 
 
Each of these competitions also offers a bonus for making a milestone -- Corrections Implementation's milestone bonus is $1,000, while Correction Data pays $750. This bonus is payable to any team (not just the first- or second-place ones) who make at least one milestone and a final submission.
