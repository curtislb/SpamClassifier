6:32 AM, 6/21/07, Update: Astronauts prepare for entry; Russian computer te=
st on tap=20

Keeping tabs on threatening weather, the Atlantis astronauts were awakened =
today around 5:40 a.m. to begin preparations for re-entry and landing at th=
e Kennedy Space Center. The crew has two opportunities to land in Florida t=
oday, at 1:55 p.m. and 3:30 p.m., but forecasters predict low clouds and af=
ternoon thunderstorms in the area. If the weather prevents a return to Eart=
h today, the astronauts will remain in orbit an additional day and try agai=
n on Friday.

Aboard the international space station, meanwhile, commander Fyodor Yurchik=
hin and flight engineer Oleg Kotov plan to carry out a test to help Russian=
 engineers figure out what might have caused computer failures last week th=
at crippled the lab complex.

During installation of a new set of U.S. solar arrays, the Russian command =
module's three guidance, navigation and contgrol computers, known collectiv=
ely as the terminal computer, along with three high-level command-and-contr=
ol machines known as the central computer, failed to reboot after the guida=
nce system crashed. After three days of around-the-clock troubleshooting, R=
ussian engineers asked Yurchikhin and Kotov to install jumper cables to byp=
ass suspect secondary power supply switches.

The repair worked and after additional tests and checkout, two computers, o=
r "lanes," in each system were brought back on line. The other two were kep=
t off line in backup mode. But engineers still don't know what caused the s=
o-called soft switches in the secondary power supplies to act up. The circu=
itry is designed to cut off power to the computers if the incoming electric=
ity isn't stable to within fairly narrow parameters.

Some engineers suspected the new solar arrays caused some slight change in =
the station's power grid that affected the power supply switches. But durin=
g a test last Friday, the computers were isolated from the new arrays and t=
hey still failed to boot up. Yurchikhin and Kotov then bypassed the seconda=
ry power supply switches and all six computers ultimately were successfully=
 activated.

Today, around 9:05 a.m., the two off-line backup computers - lane No. 1 of =
the central computer and lane No. 2 in the terminal computer - will be acti=
vated during a pass over Russian ground stations. One orbit later, Yurchikh=
in and Kotov will shut down both computers and remove the jumper cables ins=
talled last week. One orbit after that, around 12:25 p.m., Yurchikhin will =
attempt to restart the two computers in their original configuration. The t=
est should help engineers pin down whether the cause of last week's problem=
 was transitory or the result of some ongoing issue.

Russian mission managers plan to launch replacement computer gear aboard an=
 unmanned Progress supply ship scheduled for takeoff July 22. But before th=
ey install any new gear, engineers would like to pin down the root cause of=
 the earlier computer problems.
