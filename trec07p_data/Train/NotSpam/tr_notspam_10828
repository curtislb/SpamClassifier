Packages installed under 1.9.1 will be unusable under current R.

Not use the data directory for non-R data?  R is perfectly capable of 
unzipping the data for its own use.  As 'Writing R Extensions' says

  The @file{data} subdirectory is for additional data files the package
  makes available for loading using @code{data()}.  Currently, data files
  can have one of three types as indicated by their extension: plain R
  code (@file{.R} or @file{.r}), tables (@file{.tab}, @file{.txt}, or
  @file{.csv}), or @code{save()} images (@file{.RData} or @file{.rda}).

You could for example install via the inst directory.
