Rather than going through the somewhat buggy process of trying to  
determine which of the
many character sets there are, is there some way that I can just  
universally convert everything
into UTF8?

I can open a file with a :utf8 declaration when creating the file  
handle.  But do I need to do this on a utf8 file or will perl just  
"know".  If it doesn't, can I just open everything in utf8 mode and  
not lose any data?
