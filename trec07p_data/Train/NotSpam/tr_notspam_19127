Please post a short but complete script that demonstrates your issue.
There is no such thing as a "NULL" key in your hash.  Hash keys are
strings.  The stringified version of undef() is the empty string.
Therefore, accessing it via $hash{""} should work.

Have you tried examining your hash using Data::Dumper, to see what's
*really* in it?

use Data::Dumper;
print Dumper(\%hash);

What is the output of these two statements?
