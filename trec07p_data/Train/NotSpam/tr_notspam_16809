In addition to the above categories, would it be helpful to also have
'm86k' as another platform?  What are people's views on the above
proposed additions?

Also, Jerry mentioned sharing of queries on RT.  How does one go about
this?  I have my own searches for [TODO], [CAGE], [BUG], and [PATCH]
and I don't know if they are of any help to others, but they might be.
 How do I use other people's other queries?
