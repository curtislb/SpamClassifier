I wanted to do things incrementally. With RT #42898 the patch sequence
dealing with extension guessing is code complete. With the full interface
cut in code I will do up the tests and docs as #429898 gets kicked around.

The relationship between #41908 and the patch may not be entirely clear
because I wanted to get feedback on my plan before I finished all the chang=
es.=20
That is why there is so much speculation in #41908.

I also took care to make sure the existing tree was not disrupted,=20
and that the new behavior could be adopted incrementally.=20
The latter in particular was why what could have been one patch was split=20
into #41908, and #42898. I wanted the preservation of existing behavior tes=
ted=20
by other people before I took the next step.

I will keep your comments in mind with my future submissions to RT. Your re=
ply
indicates that at the very least I could improve my clarity when communicat=
ing
with the project.=20

With these comments in mind if you have a better approach I for the future
please let me know about it.
