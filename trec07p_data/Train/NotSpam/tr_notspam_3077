I'm no expert but it read's like you haven't got a version of gnu 
make installed. Is there a /usr/bin/make? The path to make looks a 
bit wrong, presumably there shold be a leading slash / at the 
beginning of the path;  "/usr/bin/make" as opposed to "usr/bin/make".

Just a guess. Hopefully someone else will have more useful info for 
you,

Good luck,
Dp.
