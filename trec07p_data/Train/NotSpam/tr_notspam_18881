2:34 PM, 6/13/07, Update:  Spacewalk begins

Astronauts Pat Forrester and Steve Swanson, floating in the space station's=
 Quest airlock module, switched their spacesuits to internal battery power =
at 2:28 p.m. to officially kick off a planned six-and-a-half-hour spacewalk.

This is the 85th spacewalk devoted to station construction and maintenance =
since assembly began in 1998 and the second of four planned by the Atlantis=
 astronauts. Going into today's EVA, 47 NASA astronauts, 15 Russians, two C=
anadians and four fliers from Japan, Germany, France and Sweden had logged =
515 hours and 20 minutes of spacewalk time building the international outpo=
st.

Forrester and Swanson will begin their spacewalk by making their way up to =
the P6-2B solar array truss to smooth out blanket folds and assist in the p=
anel's retraction. Earlier today, working inside the space station, the ast=
ronauts successfully retracted the array 7.5 bays of its 30.5 bays, or abou=
t 28 feet, before standing down for the spacewalk.

Several grommets on individual blanket slats appeared hung up on guidewires=
. Using custom non-conducting tools, Forrester and Swanson plan to free any=
 hangups to clear the way for additional retraction attempts.

But they only plan to spend about 45 minutes or so on the array before turn=
ing their attention to completing the activation of a rotary joint needed t=
o turn a newly installed set of solar arrays. Additional time is built into=
 the crew's flight plan Thursday and during another spacewalk Friday to wor=
k on the array as required.

Here is a revised timeline for today's spacewalk based on the actual start =
time (in EDT and event elapsed time):

EDT........HH...MM...EVENT

02:28 PM...00...00...EVA-2: Suits to battery power
02:38 PM...00...10...EVA-2: Airlock egress
03:18 PM...00...50...EVA-2: P6-2B retraction assist
04:03 PM...01...35...EVA-2: Deploy solar alpha rotary joint braces
04:33 PM...02...05...EVA-2: EV3: Install SARJ drive motor 1
04:33 PM...02...05...EVA-2: EV4: Remove SARJ locks
05:33 PM...03...05...EVA-2: EV3: Remove SARJ locks
08:23 PM...05...55...EVA-2: Cleanup and ingress
08:58 PM...06...30...EVA-2: Airlock repressurization
