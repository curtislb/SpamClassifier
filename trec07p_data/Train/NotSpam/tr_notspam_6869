1. IRS Accepts More Tax Payments via Credit Card

The IRS recently expanded the types of payments http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=169685,00.html individuals and businesses can pay by phone or Internet with their credit cards.  

Beginning this year, you can use your credit card to pay Trust Fund Recovery Penalty liabilities and the balance due on certain employment tax returns, including installment agreement payments on those liabilities.

2. What Business Expenses Can I Deduct?

Business expenses http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=109807,00.html are the cost of carrying on a trade or business. These expenses are usually deductible if the business is operated to make a profit. 

It is important to separate business expenses from: 
--Expenses used to figure the cost of goods sold
--Capital Expenses
--Personal Expenses

Our series of Fact Sheets on the Tax Gap http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=158619,00.html has additional guidance for deducting certain business expenses.

3. Some Issues to Consider When Operating a Business with Your Spouse 

One of the advantages of operating your own business is hiring family members. However, the employment tax requirements for family employees may vary from those that apply to other employees. 

Here are some other issues http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=97732,00.html  to consider when spouses operate a business together.

4. New Developments in International Taxation

Operating a small business is challenging enough in the United States, but when you do business overseas, you confront another layer of complexity and regulations. 

This IRS.gov New Developments in International Taxation page http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/international/article/0,,id=96628,00.html leads you through some of the regulations, certain fees, forms to use, and residency and housing issues when doing business internationally.

5. Recommended Reading for Small Businesses

The IRS has a number of publications for small businesses, and this comprehensive list is a great resource. http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=99083,00.html 

Most are available to browse online. All may be downloaded in Adobe PDF format and printed.
