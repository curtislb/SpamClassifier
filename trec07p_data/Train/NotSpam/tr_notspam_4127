You can use the open source QEMU program to create VMware machines.
http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/qemu/ 

After installing QEMU, the following command creates a machine with 20
Gb disk space, onto which you can load a (licensed!) copy of Windows (or
better, Linux :-) ):

qemu-img.exe create -f vmdk VMmachine.vmdk 20G

Again, you can do this for free with QEMU, using the -snapshot option.
