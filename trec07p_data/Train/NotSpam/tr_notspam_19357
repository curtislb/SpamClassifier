5:52 PM, 6/14/07, Update: Gerstenmaier urges patience, says Russians will r=
esolve - or work around - computer glitches=20

Russian engineers troubleshooting computer problems aboard the internationa=
l space station coaxed three of six critical guidance and control computers=
 back into operation today after a crippling shutdown Wednesday. A few hour=
s later, apparently still experiencing problems, the two operating command-=
and-control computers, along with a lone guidance computer, were shut back =
down to give engineers time to assess telemetry.

Additional troubleshooting and work to restore the computer system to more =
normal operation will be attempted early Friday when the space station pass=
es back within range of Russian ground stations.

"Is this routine? No, it's not routine," veteran station astronaut Bill McA=
rthur, manager of safety and mission assurance for the shuttle program in H=
ouston, told CBS News. "This is a situation that's a little more challengin=
g than we've run into before. We really must recover the function of the co=
mputers in the Russian segment. They are required to maintain full attitude=
 control, which is mandatory after the shuttle undocks. So this is somethin=
g we're taking very, very seriously.

"We do have confidence, though, that we're going to be able to come to a re=
solution of this issue and get the station back in a nominal configuration,=
" said McArthur, who spent 190 says aboard the station in 2005 and 2006. "I=
 have a lot of experience working with our Russian colleagues. They're very=
 professional, they do understand this vehicle quite well and we're confide=
nt that within the next few days they'll understand the problem with these =
redundant computers and get the station back under nominal control."

In the meantime, power from the U.S. segment of the station is flowing into=
 the Russian Zarya module and a three-seat Soyuz lifeboat docked to a downw=
ard-facing port. After the computer shutdowns Wednesday, Zarya lost power w=
hen its solar arrays were no longer able to track the sun. As a precaution,=
 the Russians switched the Soyuz over to power from its own solar arrays an=
d batteries. That problem, at least, has been resolved and Zarya remains fu=
lly powered.

"We're in a stable configuration," said Bill Gerstenmaier, NASA's chief of =
space operations. "We're not really sure what caused this problem, it's goi=
ng to take a little bit of time to understand it because of the complexity.=
 But once we understand it, we'll get station back in operating function."

As to characterize the severity of the problem, Gerstenmaier said engineers=
 have plenty of time to resolve it or come up with work arounds and "we're =
still a long away away from where we'd be to de-man the space station."

"We're getting more creative as we go, we're figuring out other ways to ope=
rate station that will keep us manned for an extended period of time," he s=
aid. "So I think we're a long way from that scenario. But if we got there, =
we would leave station in a configuration where we could come back to it if=
 we had to. But we're not near where we have to go de-man space station."

Problems first started cropping up Tuesday when critical Russian computers =
began acting erratically. On Wednesday, the three redundant computers makin=
g up the guidance and navigation system went down. That prompted an automat=
ed attempt to reboot the navigation system computers as well as the station=
's three command-and-control computers.

To the surprise of the engineering community, the computers failed to reboo=
t.

The guidance computers are used to fire Russian maneuvering jets when the s=
tation's orientation must be changed to a degree that is beyond the capabil=
ity of U.S. control moment gyroscopes, or CMGs. With the shuttle Atlantis d=
ocked to the station, the problem was not severe because any problems could=
 be corrected by the orbiter's maneuvering jets.

Gerstenmaier said today engineers are working on alternative ways to contro=
l the station's orientation, or attitude, including use of rocket thrusters=
 in an unmanned Progress supply ship docked at lab complex.

"Ideally, we would like to have the Russian computers up and operating when=
 the shuttle undocks," Gerstenmaier said. "That way, we can ... command the=
 thrusters on the space station to essentially remove the momentum associat=
ed with the docking attitude and desaturate the CMGs and get back in contro=
l."

When gyroscopes get "saturated," the spinning wheels can no longer affect t=
he station's orientation. Rocket thrusters are used instead, moving the sta=
tion and "desaturating" the gyros.

"Could we undock today in this configuration, even with the computers down?=
 I think we could," Gerstenmaier said. "We would end up saturating the cont=
rol moment gyros and we're looking at options to potentially use the Progre=
ss to provide that desaturating capability."

"Ideally, we'd like to have the computers up and operating in some function=
 before the shuttle departs. But if we had to have the shuttle depart now, =
it would be off nominal for us but the shuttle could depart and we would st=
ill be in a stable configuration with station."

Engineers say the computer problem may have been triggered by trouble with =
a power converter used to feed electricity from the new U.S. solar arrays i=
nto the Russian segment of the station. Engineers also are studying how "no=
isy" the power might be and the possibility of electromagnetic interference.

"We're still struggling to try to understand what the real problem is here,=
" Gerstenmaier said. "As you change any configuration, the first thing you =
want to go back and look at, did any of the configuration change cause the =
problem we've got? So when we added the solar arrays, was there anything un=
ique with that power or the electro-motive interference that could be assoc=
iated with that that could be causing a problem?

"So we've got to try to isolate some of the new arrays from the Russian seg=
ment and see if that helps. We also have an oscilloscope on board and we'll=
 probably be able to go ahead and take a look at some of the power quality =
to see if that's causing any problems."

Resolving the problem will take time, he said, "it will not be quick. Unles=
s we get lucky right away and find the problem, it will be a couple of days=
 we'll probably be in this configuration."
