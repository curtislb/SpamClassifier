HEADLINES:
PRES. BUSH: WILL MEET WITH LEADERS OF BOTH PARTIES ON MILITARY FUNDING
President Bush, frustrated over the failure of Congress to deliver a $123 billion emergency supplemental defense funding bill to his desk, said today he will invite leaders from both parties to the White House next week to discuss the issue.  Mister Bush spoke in Fairfax, Virginia, one day after the fourth anniversary of the fall of the Iraqi capital to U.S. forces.  The president is upset over the funding bills passed last month by the House and Senate, because both contain dates in 2008 for beginning the removal of combat troops from Iraq.  He noted the measures also contain "pork" projects, and he vowed once again to veto any bill with troop withdrawal deadlines.  He said it has been 64 days since he requested the money from Congress. Most of the money is targeted for Iraq, but some also would go to Afghanistan and improvements at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.  Lawmakers from the two houses will have to agree on a compromise bill to send the president. The Senate retur!
 ned from spring recess today, but House members don't return until next week.  "The Democrats who pass these bills know that I will veto them. And they know that this veto will be sustained. Yet they continue to pursue the legislation, and as they do, the clock is ticking for our troops in the field," President Bush said.  At a brief appearance before reporters after the president’s talk, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid accused the president of overemphasizing military operations.  Quoting what he said were comments by the top U.S. commander in Iraq, General David Petraeus, the Nevada Democrat said the Iraq mission is 20 percent military and 80 percent economic, diplomatic and political.

HOUSE COMMITTEE TO EXAMINE PENTAGON'S TILLMAN, LYNCH STORIES
Today, a House committee announced it will examine how the Pentagon ended up spreading false stories about the capture of Army private Jessica Lynch and the death of NFL star-turned-soldier Pat Tillman.  The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee is scheduled to take up those cases in an April 24 hearing.  The hearing will feature testimony from Lynch and relatives of Tillman, who was killed by friendly fire in Afghanistan in 2004.  The House committee "will examine why inaccurate accounts of these two incidents were disseminated, the sources and motivations for the accounts, and whether the appropriate administration officials have been held accountable," its leaders said in a written statement.  Lynch was a private first class with a maintenance company that came under fire in the early days of the invasion of Iraq in 2003. The Pentagon reported that she was shot and stabbed during a fierce firefight with Iraqi troops that led to 11 of her comrades being killed.  !
  She became a celebrity after U.S. troops stormed the hospital where she was being held and rescued her in what American commanders said at the time was a dangerous, daring raid.  But hospital staff said no Iraqi troops were in the hospital at the time, and they had unsuccessfully tried to turn Lynch over to American forces earlier. Lynch later turned out to have suffered broken bones when her vehicle crashed during the battle; her weapon was jammed with sand and she never fired a shot.  Meanwhile, the Defense Department announced in March that nine military officers, including four generals, face "corrective action" in connection with Tillman's death.

MORE THAN 30 KILLED IN BOMBINGS, MORTAR FIRE, RAIDS IN IRAQ
A U.S. chopper battled insurgents in central Baghdad today as part of a day long skirmish in which four Iraqi soldiers and three insurgents were killed and 16 U.S. troops were wounded.  The severe, protracted dust-up that tore through the Fadhil area of Baghdad was one of a series of incidents on a day that left more than two dozen people dead in a college district, at a secondary school in Baghdad, a police recruiting center in Diyala province in the north and a coalition raid in
Anbar province in the west.  Elsewhere, in the southern Shiite city of Diwaniya, U.S. and Iraqi authorities continued their Operation Black Eagle, which began Friday against Shiite militias.  That effort so far has killed 14 people and wounded 61, among them Shiite militia members, an Interior Ministry official tells CNN. It is not known how many people were killed in the incident today.

HOUSE PANEL ISSUES SUBPOENA FOR JUSTICE DEPT. DOCUMENTS
Stepping up congressional pressure on Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, the House Judiciary Committee today issued a subpoena demanding additional internal Justice Department documents relating to the firing of eight federal U.S. attorneys.  Democratic Congressman John Conyers of Michigan, chairman of the committee, said in a letter to Gonzales he had been patient over the past few weeks in awaiting a response to its request for additional material, but the Justice Department had run out of time.  "At this point further delay in receiving these materials will not serve any constructive purpose," Conyers said.  Justice Department officials said they intend to issue a formal response today.  Officials declined comment on the wide-ranging subpoena but insisted they have been forthcoming in producing thousands of pages of internal documents.

RUTGERS BASKETBALL WOMEN AGREE TO MEET WITH DON IMUS
The players of the Rutgers University women's basketball team have agreed to meet with radio-shock jock Don Imus to hear what he has to say about referring to them on the air with a racially and sexually laced phrase.  At a news conference today, team captain Essence Carson said the meeting will take place soon at "an undisclosed location."  Speaking on behalf of the team, Heather Zurich, 19, expressed distress and anger at Imus' comments: "What hurts the most about this situation is that Mr. Imus knows not one of us personally. He doesn't know that Matee is the funniest person you will ever meet; Kia is the big sister you never had but always wanted; and Piff would make an unbelievable lawyer one day."  The players expressed hope that the meeting will produce something positive. "I would like to know why, what the reason was for what was said…I would like him to get to know us as a whole and myself ... and (discover) why that statement is so false," said player Rashida Jena!
 y.  Despite apologies Friday and yesterday, Imus has been suspended by CBS Radio for two weeks for describing the Rutgers University women's basketball team as "nappy-headed hos."  CBS Radio owns New York sports-talk station WFAN, Imus' flagship station.  The network said the suspension will take effect April 16, allowing Imus to remain on the air for a Thursday-Friday radio telethon to benefit charities the host supports.  The cable news channel MSNBC also announced it would suspend its simulcast of Imus’s show for the same two-week period.  Imus has pledged "to change the discourse on his program moving forward," the network said. But it added, "Our future relationship with Imus is contingent on his ability to live up to his word."
