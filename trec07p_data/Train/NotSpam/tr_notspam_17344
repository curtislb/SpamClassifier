			<p class="storytext">If all goes as planned, I am going to start video blogging on this blog. We already post lots of pictures and video, but the new feature is video blogging. It may start today — we are working on getting the kinks out of the system.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Last night, when we got back to our hotel, my <a href="javascript:siteSearch('BlackBerry');"><b>BlackBerry</b></a> began buzzing like crazy: an arrest was announced in the <a href="javascript:siteSearch('Kelsey Smith');"><b>Kelsey Smith</b></a> murder. To give you an idea of what work is like in cable news, I then spent about an hour on the phone and BlackBerry getting details. Yes, good news that an arrest was made... and even better news if this IS certainly the killer so that another killer is off the street.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Like you, I have just learned that <a href="javascript:siteSearch('Paris Hilton');"><b>Paris Hilton</b></a> got out of jail. Well, to be more precise, her terms of confinement have changed. She is still confined, but her confinement is in her home. Yes, it is much, much, much better than the solo cell in the jail. Many people may be upset with this change in circumstances, but I assume the sheriff decided that it was better — big picture better — to change her terms of confinement. He probably took into account overcrowding, cost, etc., in making this decision. It is being reported that he did it for medical reasons. I assume we will get more info as the day marches on.</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Jailers have to be practical at times. Frankly, I am surprised the sheriff makes this decision since where I practiced law it was the punisher (the judge) who would make this type of decision. Of course each jurisdiction has its own rules and procedures. I am sure many think she got "special treatment" — that I don't know until we are able to actually compare her experience to others who were arrested for DUI and then violated probation (as he has). Paris Hilton is one of those high-profile cases where people are quick to take sides based on whether you like her or not. The law, on the other hand, needs to be dispassionate and make decisions based on other factors than emotions or likes or dislikes.</p>

			<p class="storytext">Howdy Greta,<br />
I read the post you put on your blog about the property owner wanting more money for his property. To tell you the truth, I think this guy is just wanting attention from the media and he seems like he doesn't really care too much about those lives that were lost on his property. If I were involved with this, I would suggest that they search else where to put up a memorial. I know it may sound silly and it did happen on his property, but with him acting selfishly and being a grouch, maybe the families and Patrick White should go else where to find another piece of land to put the memorial on. Maybe then, the jerk would change his mind about the price for his property. Also, I think that Patrick White should have an independent appraiser go to the site to look over the land and if this guy is charging way too much for the property and it is not worth that much, he could get cited for fraud. So I would look into that Greta and find out just how much that property is worth and then go from there. Whelp, you have a great week and don't work too hard, lol. Just tell 'em I said for them to not work ya too hard. Tell Mr. O'Reilly and Sean Hannity and Alan Holmes I said Hello.<br />
You take care.<br />

			<p class="storytext">I'm the first one to get mad at people who make comments about your hair or what you're wearing... I keep thinking they're watching the wrong channel (should be Fashion Channel) But, Greta, I'm going to go totally shallow here... as I watched some of the debate last night... I just can't see how Tommy Thompson thinks anyone will take him seriously if he keeps wearing that God-awful hair piece. It drove me to distraction. There. I said it. Could I be the only one who notices this?<br />

			<p class="storytext">Dear Greta,<br />
As of now they say they have found her body-what I want to know is-the father is a police officer — have they tried to match that guy up with any arrest's that the dad might have been involved with. Maybe it was someone out to get revenge against him. Maybe I watch to much "Law and Orders."<br />

			<p class="storytext">Hi Greta,<br />
I know a lot of people who are anxiously waiting for you to interview Beth Twitty and John Ramsey about their friendship — or maybe romance? I know you can get the scoop.<br />
Thanks</p> 
		
			<p class="storytext"><strong>E-mail No. 5</strong></p> 
		
			<p class="storytext">Hi Greta,<br />
Our Dish satellite is misaligned and we have lost FOX. [The tech is coming Saturday.] I will try and see if I can download your show to my MP-3.<br />
Right now, I am listening to Bill O'Reilly on FOX Radio [the computer stream]. It is delayed by one hour from the TV show. Here is my thought. Can you get your show on FOX Radio, too? Then folks could hear your show from anywhere on their computer.<br />
Just a thought.<br />
Will send you a separate e-mail of a pix of Laura Ingraham who finally got her F-18 flight. I am having FOX withdrawal symptoms already!<br />
Good night,<br />

			<p class="storytext">Greta,<br />
I have to say this to someone, and as I think you will agree with me you are stuck with my message.<br />
I have never heard a statement by a grieving father, almost at the instant of learning of his daughter's death that was both so articulate and so generous.<br />
One is always moved by such statements but his brought us close to the searchers, his daughter, and his family's loss. I could say more, but I think this is enough.<br />
Best,<br />
