Dear Cabot Wealth Advisory Reader,

If you've been aggressively invested over the past three months you've
enjoyed the fruits of a marvelous buying stampede, and I congratulate you.
It takes courage and discipline to be an early buyer in a bull market.

But if you haven't been aggressively invested over that time, I have an
important message for you today, and it's this.  Perhaps you should
consider a low-risk method of investing that succeeds regardless of the
market's ups and downs.

My logic goes like this.

Over the years I've seen that the biggest market losses are suffered by
investors who buy too late in the market cycle.  Sometimes it's not their
fault; they've just had a windfall and they want to put it to work.

But more frequently it comes down to fear and greed.  These people fail to
invest early in the bull market for one simple reason - they're afraid. 
And by the time that fear is overcome by greed - when the stories of
profits that have been made by others overcome the fear of losing money -
it's late in the cycle.  And next thing you know, their stocks are going
down.

Now, market cycles are here to stay, and many of our Cabot publications
work with those cycles.  But if you've deferred aggressive investment
until now, and if fear is one of the reasons, I suggest you take a look at
Cabot Benjamin Graham Value Letter.

Benjamin Graham, of course, is the father of value investing.  One of his
students was Warren Buffet, who's done pretty well for himself.   
Another was Dr. Wilson Payne, who later worked with Roy Ward at Babson
College to computerize the formulas behind the great system.   
And Roy Ward is the editor of Cabot Benjamin Graham Value Letter!

What this means to you is simple.  You follow Roy's advice, confident that
you're buying at a deep discount, regardless of the market cycle.  You
hold on for a year, or two, or three, until the stock reaches Roy's target
price, and then you sell.

Recent winners:

Total System Services (a processor of credit cards) up 56.4% in 17
months.

Reliance Steel (a metals wholesaler) up 32% in 12 months

ExxonMobil (you know who they are!) up 22% in 8 months

It's not exciting, but it works.  In fact, since its inception at the end
of 1995, Roy's Wise Owl Model has racked up a compound annual return of
16.5% compared to 7.4% for the S&P 500.

And the Classic Model is up 26.2% compounded since 2002, compared to a
gain of 8.4% by the Dow!

So if you've delayed investing until now because of fear of losing money,
or even if you're just looking for a low-risk investing method that works,
give it a try.

I've arranged a special offer for readers of Cabot Wealth Advisory, and
