It is not.

Similarly, by accepting the CDDL, you are not giving up the right to
choose a venue in case you get sued over the software; instead, you are
simply gaining the right to use, modify, and redistribute the software
under a given set of rules (which simply does not include "the right to
choose a court in which to settle disagreements"). That is what matters,
and that is what makes the software free.

Even if my argument would be flawed (which I don't think it is, but just
in case), that wouldn't even matter. What matters is that DFSG#1 talks
about "a royalty or other fee"--i.e. money--not "giving up rights"; and
any interpretation of the text that says it does talk about giving up
rights is incorrect to begin with.
