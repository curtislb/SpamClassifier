I know that Jon Philips was interested in doing something similar, with 
particular focus on footage that documents the Free Culture movement.  He 
made a page on the freeculture.org wiki about his idea - 
http://wiki.freeculture.org/Spread_Free_Culture .  freeculture.org is the 
student arm of the Free Culture movement, for those who don't know it. 
I've been very busy lately and dropped the ball on helping him, which I'm 
a little sad about.

I wanted to take this time to make sure people have had a chance to look 
at his idea as written on our wiki and discuss any appropriate sharing of 
work. (-:

On the software end, as I understand things, Jon was probably going to use 
ccHost.
