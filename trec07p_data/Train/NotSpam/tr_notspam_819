Dear CBS Space News Subscriber:

Hi. Please take a moment to read this note.

We are still trying to troubleshoot problems with our new email system. If =
you received a CBS News space update 4/10 on NASA's decision to move the sh=
uttle Discovery's launch to June 8, tank repairs permitting, please disrega=
rd this message and do NOT reply! Thanks
If you did NOT receive the 4/10 update from the new system, please read on.=
..

CBS News recently switched to a new email system. Some space news subscribe=
rs reported they had been dropped from the new system and were no longer re=
ceiving updates. I sent out an advisory earlier this year using the old ema=
il system - the same one used to send this note - and asked readers who wer=
e NOT getting updates to let me know so we could troubleshoot the problem.

The results were not as clear cut as I had hoped. Some readers clearly had =
been dropped from the list. But I only filed a few updates in January, Febr=
uary and March and some other readers apparently confused the lower-than-no=
rmal number of updates with an email problem. I no doubt added to the confu=
sion when, by accident, I filed an update or two using the old system. That=
 may have led some readers to believe they were back on the list when, in f=
act, they were not.

In any case, the old system is being phased out and I would like to make on=
e more attempt to identify readers who have clearly been dropped from the l=
ist so we can fix it. So...

1. If you received the 4/10 shuttle update, you are on the new email list a=
nd no action is required. Please don't reply to this note
2. If you did NOT receive the 4/10 update, please send me a note and we'll =
make another attempt to straighten things out.

My sincere apologies for the confusion. I truly appreciate everyone's patie=
nce. Again, please DO NOT REPLY if you received the 4/10 update
Regards,

Bill Harwood
CBS News Space Analyst
