It looks like an object is what I want.  Am I correct?  Suppose I need to work
with a bit of data that actually has 11 attributes.  This would be an object of
another type.  However, I need to manipulate pieces of it differently.  So I'm
guessing I would create an object thusly:

sub objectname {
    my %hashOfAttribs {
	attrib1 => undef,
	attrib2 => undef,
	attrib3 => undef
    }
}

I would then create an instance of that object

my $instance = new objectname();

I'm not certain though, how to populate the elements.  would it actually be
my $instance = new objectname(attrib1 => value, attrib2 => value, attrib3 =>
value)?  Or would I create the instance as above and then populate it by some
other means?  For instance
$instance->hashOfAttribs {
    attrib1 => value,
    attrib2 => value,
    attrib3 => value
};

Am I at least on the right track?
