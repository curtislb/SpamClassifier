Great .. we are in sync then.

libpam-ldap has a pretty nice debconf configuration front end. We just
need to say where the ldap server is.
It would be good to integrate also some "directory" feature such as
Desktop definitions.

NO, no, no ...

Shared folders are folders that you configure in the desktop (for
example) Most companies have a documentation folder that is a share on
the network.
Also, users have folders where they store settings, documents and other.
Like $HOME/ is local, but then $HOME/Documents $HOME/server are all
stored in the main server.

For this we can use libpam-mount with a few debconf settings.
So, sysadmin could set all preseed and install enterpeise desktops on
the fly with all set.

An interesting problem to solve is how to keep users settings (all
the .directories).

One workaround should be /home/user the server share.
Then have an /home/user/local for local access. This is the opposite of
is done now.

This would be a MAJOR advance in installing enterprise environments
based in debian (suse only do ldap user configuration).

So, we could use samba, or nfs (my election network filesystems) to
load users info from the server And get them their desktop in any
computer in the company.
