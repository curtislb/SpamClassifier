OK.  That makes sense.  Thanks.

I wholeheartedly agree on the readability issue.  Nor was I setting
out to add a new Way To Do anything; it's just that my automatic
expectation for what would happen (which I'm not trying to defend as
particularly logical) was being violated, and P6 hasn't done that too
often.  So I prodded to see what was going on in @larry.brain.  Your
explanation is all I needed to shush the little grumbles in my head.
Thanks again!
