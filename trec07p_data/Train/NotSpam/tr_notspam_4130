It's customary on this list to include the license text itself for
future reference in the discussion, and so it appears in the
archives. I've done so in this message.

The text says a few different things, but the grant of license seems
to be exactly this:

"Permission is hereby granted to use, reproduce, prepare derivative
works, and to redistribute to others."

There are no conditions attached, and that seems to grant every
freedom required for inclusion in Debian. Seems free to me.
