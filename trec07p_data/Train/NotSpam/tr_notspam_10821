the solution to that is usb->serial converters.  I'm going to school 
for IT, and hope to get a job in networking at some point soon, so 
made sure the laptop I got had a serial port.  While this wasn't the 
only deciding factor, it was pretty high on the list.  I was willing 
to sacrafice some of the 8 or 16 serial ports on certain laptops (why 
would someone want that many USB on a laptop anyway)? for a serial 
port.
