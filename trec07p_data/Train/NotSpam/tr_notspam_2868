I think the point is that one does not want to assume the two distributions 
are identical: the null hypothesis is that they have the same median but 
possibly different shapes (including spread).

You can set up bootstrap tests (see Davison & Hinkley, for example).
Cody Hamilton's CI is too crude: again see D&H or MASS for less crude 
alternatives.  However, bootstrapping a median has its own peculiarities: 
see the example in MASS and references there, including to Sheather's book.
