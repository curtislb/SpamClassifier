						<b>It's been four weeks since Madeleine McCann went missing in Portug=
al.</b>
<br>

<br>
Her parents have cooperated heavily with the media to keep her in the publi=
c eye in the hope of finding her. Yesterday Gerry and Kate McCann met the P=
ope. Later this week they will travel to Madrid.
<br>

<br>
Everyone will sympathise with the McCanns' plight. But some are beginning t=
o feel uneasy about their campaign and the coverage it is getting. Is the m=
edia right to continue to give their story such prominence? And is the inte=
rvention of figures like Zombie Brown, David Beckham and the Pope appropria=
te?
