Cool Scott, this looks all great. I don't think there is a need to put
licenses into subfolders on the system, but that is cool to read through
directories for all necessary files.

Heya, can you distill your blog notes onto:
http://wiki.creativecommons.org/liblicense

If you all look there, you can see some nice mockups which this connects
with! Get excited! Anyone interested in helping move this forward as
well?

Jon
