Hope this still goes with this subject. I tried running the newest 
grml earlier today, 1.0 in vmware and had a very odd thing happen. I 
did get speach, but, it was studdering really bad and had lowd pops 
at the start of every word so I could bearly understand anything it 
was saying. This happend two times, when I typed grml swspeak at the 
boot prompt, it took about 10 seconds, and I got some speach, but, I 
could not understand anything it said, and, then, after it finished 
booting, I typed swspeak as it says to do in the cheat codes for grml 
and I once again had speach. I could not understand this either. As I 
said, it has some very lowd hissing pops that almost completely cover 
the speach, so, very hard to understand anything. I also noticed that 
in the cheat code notes, it said something about a vmware code that I 
could use at the prompt, but, I did not understand how to use it. I 
have not had any problems getting any other distro to boot with 
speach, such as ubuntu using orca, orilux, debian using speakup and 
my doubletalk lt, etc. So, maybe I am just doing something wrong, or, 
it's something with grml itself? If someone can give me some idea of 
what to do to fix it, or, point me to something to read, I would be greatful.
