Informed Medical Decisions - Here's One!

Editor's Note

I received an email from a reader today asking, in short, if it was too
late to invest in China.

To me, that's a bit like asking if it's too late to teach your
four-year-old to swim.

Or if it's too late to buy real estate in Brazil.

In short, "No."

The Chinese economy remains strong, and Chinese stocks continue to act
extremely well, shaking off all the bad news that's been thrown their way
in recent months.

First there was the contaminated pet food.  Then there was the
contaminated toothpaste.  And now there's the child/slave labor at rural
brick factories.

By American standards, every one of these stories exposes a violation of
human (or animal) rights.  Yet through every one, Chinese stocks keep
rolling onward and upward.

And why?  Because money goes where it's treated best, and today it's
treated better at fast-growing companies in China than in slow-growing
companies in the U.S.

Now, many people, repulsed by stories like those above, refuse to invest
in China.  And I understand their thinking.

But I know from experience that if you delay investing in a company or a
stock until all the problems are gone, you usually find yourself investing
near the top!

The fact is, bull markets climb a wall of worry, so the fact that China
still has plenty of worries is a good thing.  Of course, the knowledge
that the Chinese government is working hard to fix all the country's
problems it can before next summer's Olympics is comforting, too.

But most important is the knowledge that the Middle Kingdom is fast making
up for lost time, and that Chinese stocks are still strong.   
And that's really all we need to see.

Using our "simple" but proven system, editor Paul Goodwin steered Cabot
China & Emerging Markets Report to a gain of 76% last year, topping all
other investment newsletters, and last I knew, he was still in first place
for 2007.  That's the power of the Chinese market!

So I'm going to let Paul take it from here, and I'll be back to you on
Thursday.

Yours in pursuit of wisdom and wealth,

>From the desk of Paul Goodwin

In one of my earlier careers, I worked for a consulting design firm
that did everything from product design and packaging to branding,
re-branding and marketing.  As a writer/information designer, my job
was to figure out how to cut all kinds of text up into chunks that
people could chew and make it tasty enough that they would want to.

Part of the genius of this company was that people like me were part of
the mission team from the beginning, sitting in on early interviews
with clients, taking part in research and focus group exercises.  And
from my present perspective as a Cabot editor, one particular moment
stands out in my memory.

The client was a large bank (since gobbled up by an even larger one)
that wanted to offer a new set of services to "high net-worth clients,"
or as we called them, rich people.  The trouble was that rich people
are hard to lure into focus groups; they had better things to do, and
their natural instinct was to talk about themselves as little as
possible.  Needless to say, the $50 and a free lunch that would make a
focus group attractive to most people didn't pack a lot of punch with
them.

Eventually, we figured out a way to get the rich folks into the room;
we offered to donate $1,000 to the charity of their choice in their
name.

The results of the group discussion weren't really surprising.  It
turned out that what rich people wanted most was one person at the bank
that they could call to get things done.  Junior bounces a check at
Yale?  Call the personal banker.  Need to transfer money from one
account to another?  Personal banker.

But during the discussion of how these people handled their money, one
of the rich guys said that he handled money for just about everyone in
his family.  In essence, he was the family's investor.  And he said
that he had been averaging returns of about 35 percent a year for the
previous five years!

That was impressive enough, but the moment that sticks in my mind came
later, as we were discussing the results of the day's interviews.  One
of the bankers was shaking her head and said, "35 percent, do you know
how much risk he had to take to get that kind of return!?!"

There I was, sitting there admiring the guy's skill at getting great
returns, and the bankers were freaking out about his risk level.  Well,
believe me, I now know what they were talking about.

Brazil, Russia, India and China - the BRIC countries that my Cabot
China & Emerging Markets Report concentrates on - all have fast-growing
economies and plenty of young companies that are riding the emerging
markets growth wave.  But they also have lots of money chasing the
stocks of those companies, including lots of it run by institutional
investors like the bankers who were so horrified by the rich focus
group man (and mutual fund managers and hedge fund honchos and private
equity folks).

These investors, the whales who make the waves that individual
investors have to swim through, are a prime source of the volatility
that makes emerging markets such a risky business.  And the reason they
generate so much volatility is that they are constantly trying to
figure out the future.

They have to try, of course, because they are in charge of investment
positions so large that any big surprise can trap them holding millions
of dollars of a stock ... without any way of getting out.  Their
positions are so large that it can take weeks to sell out the
portfolio's holdings without swamping the market.

As editor of the Cabot China & Emerging Markets Report, I sometimes do
battle (very indirectly) with these institutional whales.  A sudden
rise or drop in the price of an emerging markets stock often reflects a
change in opinion by some big money manager about what might happen in
the next year or so.

Unfortunately (or fortunately for us aggressive growth investors) these
managers are often no better at predicting the future than any other
set of prognosticators, including people who read tea leaves and those
who watch the furriness of caterpillars to get a read on the coming
winter.

I'll stick to what I know: that stocks that are going up tend to keep
going up; that good stock stories supported by good numbers are better
than either one alone; that avoiding a 10% loss is better than booking
a 10% gain; and finally, that everything that the market knows about a
stock will show up in its chart.

I try not to let the bankers get me down.  You should, too.

How Does Cabot Pick Emerging Markets Stocks?

Paul Goodwin, editor of Cabot China & Emerging Markets Report, looks
for promising companies benefiting from the rapid growth in the
economies of the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China).
These companies must also meet strict criteria regarding fundamentals
and technicals. These recommendations will have healthy balance sheets
and will show solid growth.

Visit the link below to see the explosive profits from the
fast-growing opportunities Paul recommends. See how your $5,000 can
soar to $10,000, $15,000, $25,000 - or more - over the next two to
three years.

Using the simple criteria laid out above, I've been able to find a
boatload of top-notch BRIC stocks in recent years.  I could just give
you one of my previous recommendations, but you get ideas like that all
the time from Tim.  Today, I want to chat about a stock that has
interested me for more than two years ... and actually just took a huge
leap today on great earnings.  It's a perfect example of an
underappreciated stock with a great story and great numbers that is
finally getting support from investors.

The company is China Medical Technologies (CMED), a Beijing-based
developer and marketer of medical equipment.  The company's lead
product is a machine that used high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)
to destroy solid cancers and benign tumors.  The HIFU system doesn't
require an incision; it just destroys the tumor from outside the body,
which then cleans up the dead tissue.  This non-invasive system has
been used on over 40,000 patients in China, on liver, breast and kidney
tumors, as well as tumors in the pelvic cavity and on bones.  Reports
say that patients typically feel no discomfort and can usually walk
away from the treatment.

Since I first heard about the HIFU machine (and about GE's investment
in China Med), I have been waiting for word that the company was going
to seek a clinical trial in a Western country.  I thought that this
would be the signal for the stock to go through the roof.  But that
hasn't happened.

Instead, China Med has continued to grow its revenues and earnings
inside China.  The company's immunoassay system, in-vitro diagnostics
and other diagnostic products have (along with HIFU, of course) kept
revenues growing fast.  And it's hard to argue with the company's
after-tax margins, which have topped 50% for the last six quarters!

Still, the stock has just 11 institutional sponsors, in part because
the float is just 18 million shares.

And looming over every other fact about the company and the stock is
the possibility of what might happen if the HIFU machine ever threatens
to break out of China.

A positive earnings report this morning led to a very nice breakout
from the stock's old base at 24, kicking CMED above 32 today on big
volume.  That's not bad for a stock that I once called a
"trick-or-treat" stock - one that would either flop or fly, but not
much in between.

Those of you who enjoy doing your own research will have a good time
with China Medical's website (www.chinameditech.com).  You'll find a
good story with good numbers in a good market.  And who knows, the
stock might not even need the long-awaited HIFU machine to power its
advance.

China's most-recent budget includes an enormous increase in
expenditures on national health care.  And it will take all that money
and a whole lot more to even begin to deliver the high level of medical
care enjoyed by China's city dwellers to the folks out in the
provinces.

My guess is that China Medical will thrive in this richer environment.
The company has worked very hard to make its diagnostic products simple
and reliable enough to be used by small country clinics.  Even leaving
the HIFU machine out of the equation, I think this company will be a
winner.  And if HIFU ever takes off ... well, that will be a big cherry
on top of the sundae.  Aggressive investors who take a small position
in CMED won't be bored.
