  Top Del. court upholds dismissal of forged art lawsuit

By RANDALL CHASE, Associated Press
Posted Friday, April 27, 2007 at 11:36 am

DOVER ? The state Supreme Court has upheld the dismissal of lawsuit 
filed by a Delaware couple who claimed they were defrauded when they 
bought a forged painting at a Christie?s auction.

Johannes and Betty Krahmer appealed to the Supreme Court last year after 
a Chancery Court judge dismissed their 2004 lawsuit against Christie?s, 
saying the lawsuit was filed too late, and that there was no evidence to 
infer that the famed auction house knew the painting was a fake.

After hearing oral arguments last month, the Supreme Court issued a 
two-paragraph order Wednesday upholding the lower court decision.

Betty Krahmer declined to comment on the ruling Friday. Wilmington 
attorney Victor Battaglia, who represented the couple, was not 
immediately available for comment.
Court arguments centered on whether Delaware?s ?time of discovery? rule, 
which allows the filing period for a lawsuit to begin when a person 
first believes he has been injured, rather than the date of actual 
injury, applied to the Krahmers.

Christie?s argued that the rule typically applies to services provided 
by professionals such as doctors, lawyers and accountants, not to the 
purchase of goods.

Battaglia argued that fine art was different from other consumer goods, 
and that the case involved both an ?inherently unknowable? injury and a 
?blamelessly ignorant? plaintiff, the two criteria required by the time 
of discovery rule.

Battaglia said that, unlike art professionals, the Krahmers had no 
reason to suspect that the painting might be a fake, and that Christie?s 
representatives were so enthralled with the painting?s purported lineage 
that they failed to do their homework.

The dispute involved an oil portrait of a woman that the Krahmers bought 
in 1986, thinking it was the 1912 work ?Interior? by American 
impressionist Frank Weston Benson. They paid $38,500 and received a 
six-year limited warranty of authenticity.

In 1999, the Krahmers contacted a committee in Boston compiling a 
definitive list of Benson?s works. They subsequently learned of a 
similar painting at a Connecticut museum, which turned out to be the 
real one. When the Krahmers tried to sell their painting on consignment 
in 2002 to Sotheby?s auction house, they were told by a Sotheby?s 
restorer that it might be a forgery.

The committee in Boston theorized that the original was acquired from 
Benson by the famed Detroit Club in Michigan in 1914, but was sold in 
the early 1970s and replaced with a copy, perhaps in the original frame.

The Krahmers asked Christie?s to rescind the 1986 sale, but the auction 
house refused, saying the six-year warranty of authenticity had expired.

La Polic?a debe crear una oficina dedicada al patrimonio

Redacci?n  Cultura

Durante cinco d?as, el Instituto Nacional de Patrimonio Cultural de 
Ecuador fue la sede de un seminario que dictaron varios especialistas 
italianos sobre el cuidado y defensa del  patrimonio cultural. El 
coronel Giovanni Pastore  ha trabajado  por m?s de 10 a?os en  la 
secci?n de la  Polic?a italiana  dedicada a investigar estos delitos.

?Desde cu?ndo hay en su pa?s una secci?n de la Polic?a dedicada al  
patrimonio?
Desde la d?cada de los setenta la Unesco recomend? que cada pa?s creara 
una peque?a unidad especial de la Polic?a para defensa del patrimonio. 
Nuestro comando est? compuesto por 300 hombres y   es parte de la 
Polic?a,  pero responde, funcionalmente, al  Ministerio de Cultura.

?Siguen los casos tambi?n afuera de Italia?
Al principio segu?amos las actividades  internas, pero cuando nos dimos 
cuenta de que las piezas sal?an de la frontera, buscamos  la forma de 
seguirlas tambi?n all?.

?C?mo lo han hecho?
Creando contactos con polic?as de  otros pa?ses, estudiando las rutas 
del tr?fico de arte, viendo los coleccionistas m?s interesados.

?C?mo se puede saber ese tipo de cosas?
Es sencillo. Una persona que roba  una  pieza  cultural, naturalmente 
tiene referencias que  pueden ser otros  delincuentes o mediadores o, 
quiz?s, el comprador final de la obra robada.

?Y ellos hablan de eso?
Tienes que  hacerte  buen amigo de los delincuentes  grandes, los que 
est?n relacionados  con el circuito  internacional del tr?fico de arte. 
Esto  te ayuda a entender su psicolog?a, c?mo se mueven, a d?nde van, 
qu? prefieren...

Una amistad con inter?s.

En Italia  muchas cosas  funcionan as?. A los huaqueros, por ejemplo, el 
Estado los  ha contratado como ayudantes de los equipos de arqueolog?a. 
As? se  puede controlar sus movimientos. Es una  posibilidad, no una 
regla.    

O sea que la Polic?a tiene una  cosa menos que vigilar.

Como digo, solo es una posibilidad. El departamento que comando tiene  
12 n?cleos ubicados en las  regiones con m?s riesgos. Cada uno maneja 
unos 15 hombres  bajo el mando de un oficial.  

?Cu?l es la relaci?n  con el Ministerio de  Cultura?
Todos estos departamentos  trabajan junto a los funcionarios de las 
oficinas del Ministerio de los cuales  recibe el soporte de conocimiento 
e informaci?n para saber si los  bienes de una requisa, por ejemplo, son 
aut?nticos o si los que los ten?an eran los  due?os.  

?C?mo llevan esos datos?
Todos estos aspectos est?n concentrados en una base de datos que hemos 
acopiado desde hace m?s de 30 a?os sobre las obras que han sido robadas. 
Para empezar la investigaci?n necesitas saber las especificaciones de la 
obra, fotos, datos de  los ?ltimos  due?os. Si no tienes eso  no vas a  
poder comprobar el hurto.

?Existe una base con esos datos a escala mundial?
Nosotros  tenemos  la m?s grande del mundo. Hay otra en Lyon, Francia, 
en   la Secretar?a  General de la Interpol, pero es peque?a.

?C?mo la han hecho?
Hay toda una estructura para manejar este tipo de delitos. Una  pieza 
clave  son los magistrados, pues en Italia   hay algunos especializados 
en este tipo de delitos con los cuales se establecen lazos para agilizar 
los procedimientos.

?C?mo  volver  viable esa  estructura en Ecuador?
Primero se necesita formar ?rganos que se ocupen solo de esta materia, 
en la Polic?a, en el Instituto, en el Gobierno... ante todo  hay que 
volverse conscientes del patrimonio que tiene un pa?s y saber c?mo se lo 
da?a.

Solo ah? se puede saber c?mo hay que protegerlo.

Hoja de vida
Giovanni Pastore
Es Vicecomandante  del Comando de Carabineros para la Tutela de 
Patrimonio Cultural de Italia, oficina a la que pertenece   hace 10 
a?os. Sus estudios  militares   los realiz? en la Academia Militar de 
Modena y ha hecho carrera en  el Regimiento de Caballer?a de Carabineros.

Law provides few protections for Indian mounds
By Quintin Ellison
------------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes right down to it, the good will of private landowners is 
often what stands between saving Indian mounds and losing these pieces 
of ancient history.

?There are no legal obligations regarding mounds on private property, as 
long as the owners don?t disturb any burials that might be there,? said 
Linda Hall, a state archaeologist based in Asheville.

In the case of Cowee Mound, preservation efforts by the Hall family 
ensured its survival. The family owned the mound for 175 years until the 
death of Katherine Hall Porter in 2002. The mound then passed to her 
husband, James Porter. He and his heirs worked with the Land Trust for 
the Little Tennessee and the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indians to 
make sure that it would be protected.

Though there are other examples in Western North Carolina of private 
owners protecting mound sites, many have been lost. Hall said she?s 
aware of 15 mound sites west of Asheville. Of those, at least two have 
been excavated or graded to obliteration.

?Probably most mounds are on private property,? Hall said. ?(Cowee 
Mound) is just so commendable, how the different organizations worked 
together. It is a great resource for the future.?

The law

North Carolina?s Unmarked Human Burial and Human Skeletal Remains 
Protection Act requires that anybody ?knowing or having reasonable 
grounds to believe? human skeletal remains are being disturbed notify 
the county?s medical examiner. If the remains are discovered because of 
construction or plowing, those activities must cease immediately. Work 
can?t resume without the state?s go-ahead.

If the remains are archaeologically significant ? not a modern skeleton, 
in other words ? the state archaeologist?s office is in charge. State 
archaeologists have 48 hours to make arrangements with the landowner to 
either protect or remove the remains. At the end of the 48-hour period, 
the law states the chief archaeologist ?shall have no authority over the 
remains? and can?t stop the resumption of work on the property.

In this area, the Eastern Band gets notified if state archaeologists 
determine skeletal remains are Native American. The tribe and state 
reach an agreement on skeletal analysis and disposition.

That?s about all that governs private landowners. Otherwise, state law 
leaves it to an individual?s conscience, urging people ?to refrain from 
the excavation or destruction thereof and to forbid such conduct by 
others.?

Lost history

No one knows how many Indian mounds exist, or how many have been lost, 
noted Russell Townsend, tribal historic preservation officer for the 
Eastern Band.

Cyrus Thomas of the Bureau of American Ethnology attempted in the 1890s 
to catalogue mounds, but Townsend said many were never discovered and 
listed.

?I don?t know that an accurate count of mounds has ever been found,? he 
said.

Townsend said the tribe is currently protecting four mounds, plus 
working to help save more, including Spikebuck Town Mound and Village 
Site in Hayesville. Like Nikwasi Mound in Franklin, Spikebuck is 
publicly owned. And the Eastern Band owns and protects Kituwah Mound 
near Bryson City.

Both Kituwah Mound and Peachtree Mound in Cherokee County were 
significantly reduced in size from years of plowing.

What were they?

Mounds aren?t fully understood, but what is agreed is their service as 
focal points for towns and communities.

?They had religious as well as civil significance,? Townsend said. ?You 
can see these purposes varying from region to region, culture to 
culture, and they evolved over time.?

Mounds weren?t necessarily used for burials, though they could be. And 
to further confuse things, platform mounds ? with straight sides and a 
structure on top ? were sometimes built on top of the more humped burial 
mounds, Townsend said.

The tribal preservation officer pinpointed the primary mound-building 
period as taking place during the Mississippian culture from about 900 
A.D. to 1650 A.D. They stopped being built shortly after contact with 
Europeans occurred.

Cowee Mound was the center of a large Mississippian community that 
evolved into a large Cherokee town, he said. Cowee served as the 
business capital of the Cherokee world.

  Petroglyphs vandalized, tagged with gang graffiti

By Joline Gutierrez Krueger 
<http://www.abqtrib.com/staff/joline-gutierrez-krueger/> (Contact 
<http://www.abqtrib.com/staff/joline-gutierrez-krueger/contact/>)
Wednesday, April 25, 2007

Petroglyph National Monument is the latest target of an ongoing battle 
between Albuquerque gangs bent on proving dominance, this time by 
vandalizing the hallowed and historic park with graffiti.

At least eight large basalt boulders at the southern edge of the 
escarpment were marred with gang initials, or tags, written in silver 
metallic spray paint.

It is unclear when the vandalism occurred, but monument Police Chief 
Matthew Fuller said residents in the nearby Parkwest subdivision off 
Lava Bluff and Parkwest Roads Northwest began reporting the damage late 
last week.

"Our neighbors of the park are very vigilant and very caring," Fuller 
said. "They notify us as quickly as possible."

By Tuesday, tags had been removed from all but three boulders at the top 
of the ridge. Monument Superintendent Joseph Sanchez said his staff was 
hoping to complete the cleanup by late today or Thursday.

"We're sending a message that we're out there watching, and that such 
vandalism won't be tolerated and will be dealt with immediately," 
Sanchez said.

No petroglyphs - ancient symbols carved in the rocks as far back as 
3,000 years ago - were damaged by the spray paint, and no other lasting 
injury to the rocks was noted, Sanchez said.

Vandalism in the monument is rare but does happen on occasion, he said. 
But one neighbor said it was the first time she could recall seeing such 
vandalism at the south end of the escarpment.

Tags on the rocks read "TSK," short for Too Sick Krew, an offshoot of 
the West Side Locos gang. Both have been embroiled in a deadly four-year 
war with rival gang TCK, or Thugs Causing Kaos, that has claimed the 
lives of at least 11 people, including two children.

TSK graffiti has multiplied across the West Side in the past three 
weeks, an apparent response to law enforcement efforts to dismantle 
rival TCK and thus put an end to the gang war.

The Bernalillo County Sheriff's Department launched a multiagency sweep 
April 12, arresting two TCK suspects in two separate gang-related homicides.

Mayor Martin Chavez on Saturday announced the Albuquerque Police 
Department was also stepping up its anti-gang efforts. The initiative 
netted 25 felony arrests, 110 citations, the recovery of two stolen 
vehicles and 59 grams of methamphetamine on Friday and Saturday.

Petroglyph officials said it was too soon to estimate the cost of the 
damage and cleanup. Sanchez said costs can add up quickly because the 
biodegradable cleaning process must not harm lichens and other native 
vegetation.

Care must be given, too, to the spiritual nature of the land. Some 
American Indians, he said, believe the area is sacred.

Sanchez said park archaeologists, cultural and natural resource experts, 
law enforcement officers and park rangers were called in to handle the 
cleanup process.

"We do commend the city of Albuquerque and its graffiti abatement 
measures, but graffiti to the monument goes a little bit beyond that," 
Sanchez said. "We're charged with the preservation and protection of the 
site for future generations."

Damaging monument property is punishable by fines or incarceration; 
heftier penalties apply under the federal Archaeological Resources 
Protection Act if it can be proved that the suspect deliberately 
intended to damage the petroglyphs, Fuller said.

There are no leads so far, he said.

SoCal man indicted for transporting stolen violins to Europe

ASSOCIATED PRESS
6:22 p.m. April 25, 2007
LOS ANGELES ? A man was indicted Wednesday on charges of transporting 
two rare, stolen violins worth more than $300,000 from Los Angeles to 
Paris in an attempt to sell them.

Anthony Eugene Notarstefano, 43, of Long Beach was charged with 
possession and foreign transportation of stolen goods. He faces up to 20 
years in federal prison if convicted.

Notarstefano was arrested last month by French police after authorities 
said he approached the owner of a Paris violin shop with an offer to 
sell the two instruments for $65,000.

In a federal affidavit filed after his arrest, investigators said the 
violins were stolen Dec. 23 from the home of Los Angeles Philharmonic 
violinist Mark Kashper. One was crafted in the 18th century by Carlo 
Tononi, and the other was made in the 19th century by Jean-Baptiste 
Vuillaume.

Notarstefano remains in French custody while awaiting trial there in 
connection to the case, said Thom Mrozek, a U.S. Attorney's spokesman.

He will be extradited to face charges in the U.S. upon completion of the 
French case, Mrozek said.

It was not immediately known whether Notarstefano had hired an attorney 
to represent him in Los Angeles.

Police find forged 'Kadishman sheep'

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jonathan Beck, THE JERUSALEM POST 	Apr. 26, 2007

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Police have discovered multiple forgeries of Menashe Kadishman's "sheep" 
paintings after the artist himself alerted them that someone was faking 
his works, Channel 2 reported on Thursday evening. He said the police 
had made an arrest in the case.

In a televised interview, Kadishman said he was invited to exhibit his 
works at a Ra'anana gallery, but when making a visit to check out the 
gallery was "amazed and disgusted" to find a painting on show there that 
was supposedly by him and signed by him, but was actually a fake.

Kadishman recounted how he asked a friend of his to buy the picture, and 
that the friend paid $900 for it. He said he sold his paintings for an 
average of $3,000.

The artist said police had done a "marvelous job" in apprehending the 
"thief," as Kadishman repeatedly termed him. It was unclear how many 
forgeries had already been sold by the gallery, and whether more of them 
could still be found on the market elsewhere.

Kadishman, 76, a world-renowned Israeli artist, was schooled in Israel 
and London, and was Israel's representative in the 1968 4th "Kassel 
Dokumenta" in Germany, one of the most important art festivals, held 
every five years.

His early works were starkly abstract and often minimalist in concept. 
But Kadishman's style became less abstract in the late 1970s when he 
began his long series of representational drawings revolving around the 
motif of the sheep, a seemingly banal subject that in his work became 
laden with political and philosophical subtexts. He achieved 
international fame after 1985 when he expanded the sheep-theme to large 
paintings in full color.

While his colorful sheep remain a staple of Israeli art around the 
world, he no longer enjoys the critical acclaim he had enjoyed, 
partially because of the sheer quantity of sheep paintings.

The sheep's heads, in gay, bright colors, can be seen with their bemused 
expressions from the display windows of many galleries in Israel, and in 
Jerusalem one can even find several competing galleries on the same 
street displaying Kadishman works.

The forgeries recently discovered endanger the already saturated 
"Kadishman sheep" market because they call into question the market 
value of paintings already sold to collectors as authentic Kadishmans.

All forgeries found so far are said to be of the /pastiche /type, 
meaning they are not accurate copies masquerading as existing works 
(such as a second "Mona Lisa"), but new pieces, created in a manner 
carefully calculated to suggest the artist's own stylistic traits.

Aside from painstaking scrutiny by specialists, the only way to detect a 
forgery in such cases is to ask the artist himself to identify the pieces.

In a case like that of Kadishman, whose fame allows him both to avoid 
being represented exclusively by a single agent and to deal with many 
galleries directly, the task of cataloguing becomes difficult unless the 
artist himself keeps a catalogue of his output.

Galleries often buy his works secondhand, from collectors, and the 
paintings' provenance is based on certificates and testimonies.

Candelabri rubati a Bologna recuperati a Mantova

Cronaca Bologna -
I Carabinieri della Stazione di Gonzaga, in provincia di Mantova, hanno 
recuperato oggetti d'arte rubati per un valore compreso tra i 5 mila e i 
10 mila euro.

I 'pezzi', alcuni angioletti e candelabri lignei particolarmente 
interessanti per gli esperti di arte sacra del 7-800 italiano, facevano 
bella mostra di se' tra i banchi del mercatino del 'C'era una volta' ma 
ai Carabinieri che, da sempre, sottopongono ad attento controllo tutta 
la merce in esposizione, non e' sfuggito che gran parte della bella 
merce esposta sul banco condotto da M. A. 52enne, padovano d'origine e 
ravennate d'adozione, era in realta' provento di un furto perpetrato a 
Bologna nella notte del 23 scorso.

Grazie alla collaborazione della polizia locale di Gonzaga - Pegognaga 
ed alla disponibilita' della derubata, accorsa per riconoscere la 
refurtiva, si e' proceduto quindi al sequestro della merce e, nella 
mattinata odierna, alla denuncia in stato di liberta' per ricettazione 
del venditore che, affermava di aver regolarmente acquistato la merce in 
data antecedente il furto.
La merce, tutta in legno dorato ed argentato del 7-800 italiano, e' ora 
a disposizione della Procura della Repubblica di Mantova che dirige le 
indagini.

Le pillage du ch?teau de Fontainebleau devant le tribunal

ANG?LIQUE N?GRONI.
 Publi? le 27 avril 2007
Actualis? le 27 avril 2007 : 08h37

Treize oeuvres d'art avaient disparu lors du cambriolage du domaine. Un 
antiquaire n?erlandais ?tait jug? hier pour recel en bande organis?e.
 
? L'?POQUE directeur du Mus?e national du ch?teau de Fontainebleau, 
Amaury Lef?bure gardera longtemps en m?moire cette nuit du 15 au 16 
novembre 1995. En quelques minutes seulement, un fric-frac sans 
pr?c?dent avait ?t? commis sur le domaine, qui abrite plusieurs belles 
salles d'exposition consacr?es ? l'empereur Napol?on Ier. Treize 
superbes pi?ces - pendules, chars, vases et glaives d'apparat -, 
estim?es ? deux millions d'euros, avaient ?t? d?rob?es.
 
? Un terrible ?pisode ?, selon ce directeur qui a d?, hier, se rem?morer 
ce pillage men? selon lui par des professionnels. Sept ans apr?s les 
faits, l'affaire ?tait port?e devant le tribunal correctionnel de 
Fontainebleau. Une audience qui s'est d?roul?e avec des bancs de 
pr?venus bien d?garnis.
 
Trafic vers les ?tats-Unis
Au lieu de pouvoir remonter tout un r?seau de trafiquants d'art, 
l'Office central de r?pression et de lutte contre le trafic des biens 
culturels (OCBC) n'a pu interpeller que les receleurs pr?sum?s, trois 
antiquaires n?erlandais, dont un seul ?tait pr?sent ? l'audience. Chez 
eux, les policiers avaient retrouv? quelques objets, six au total ont 
?t? restitu?s au ch?teau. Parmi eux, deux vases de S?vres, des pendules 
datant du premier Empire et un char en bronze.
 
? la barre, les explications ont tourn? court. Ainsi, Franciscus Tanis, 
antiquaire extrad? en France dans le cadre de cette affaire, se dit 
?tranger ? tout trafic. ? Un marchand d'art a mis en d?p?t-vente chez 
lui une pendule recherch?e par les enqu?teurs. Il ignorait la provenance 
frauduleuse de cette pi?ce ?, ass?ne son avocate, Me Laure Tric.
 
Pourtant en se chargeant de l'enqu?te, l'OCBC ?tait persuad? qu'il 
allait mettre au jour un vaste r?seau europ?en de trafic d'oeuvres d'art 
apr?s une s?rie de pillages men?s dans les ann?es 1990 au pr?judice de 
ch?teaux et mus?es. Parmi les sites visit?s, le Mus?e de la Renaissance 
du ch?teau d'?couen, le ch?teau de Compi?gne, de Courances dans 
l'Essonne ou encore le Mus?e d'Ile-de-France ? Sceaux. Dans le m?me 
temps, des vols d'oeuvres d'art avaient ?t? commis chez des particuliers 
en r?gion parisienne et dans le sud de la France.
 
S'agissait-il d'une m?me ?quipe sp?cialis?e qui s?vissait sur tout le 
territoire ? ? l'?poque, l'OCBC avait soup?onn? des gens du voyage. Sur 
la base d'?l?ments d'enqu?te, il avait par ailleurs estim? que les 
Pays-Bas ?taient au coeur de l'affaire, ?rig?s en plate-forme d'un 
juteux trafic o? transitait la marchandise avant d'?tre exp?di?e aux 
?tats-Unis aupr?s de collectionneurs.
 
Dans ce coup de filet touchant le milieu des antiquaires, un nom s'est 
d?tach?. Celui de Petrus Schoofs, ?crou? dans son pays o? il purge une 
peine pour trafic d'ecstasy. Chez lui, plusieurs objets pr?cieux 
provenant de diff?rents mus?es fran?ais avaient ?t? saisis. A-t-il jou? 
un r?le pr?pond?rant dans ce commerce illicite ? L'enqu?te n'a pas pu le 
d?montrer. Comme les deux autres antiquaires, il a ?t? mis en cause pour 
des seuls faits de recel. Hier soir, le parquet a requis 30 mois de 
prison ferme - couverts par la d?tention provisoire - et 17 mois avec 
sursis contre Franciscus Tanis. Jugement le 28 juin.

*Heimkehr der Teufelsbibel* <http://www.pragerzeitung.cz/?c_id=9788>
26. 4. 2007

Der wertvolle Kodex aus dem ?Kunstraub des Jahrtausends? wird wieder in 
Prag gezeigt

Es war der wohl gr??te Kunstraub in der Geschichte der b?hmischen 
Kronl?nder, eine tschechische Zeitung bezeichnete ihn dieser Tage sogar 
als den ?Kunstraub des vergangenen Jahrtausends?. Als im Juli 1648 ? 
wenige Monate vor Verk?ndung des Westf?lischen Friedens ? die Schweden 
Prag belagerten und die Kleinseite sowie die Prager Burg besetzt 
hielten, nahmen sie alles Wertvolle mit, dessen sie habhaft werden 
konnten. Auf der Prager Burg stie?en sie auf die Kunstsammlung von 
Kaiser Rudolf II., die dieser in vielen Jahren zusammentragen lie?. Die 
damals weit ?ber die Grenzen des Habsburger Reiches bekannte 
Rudolfinische Kunst- und Wunderkammer r?umten sie gr?ndlich aus und 
verschleppten einen Kunstschatz unermesslichen Wertes nach Stockholm in 
die Schatzkammern der schwedischen K?nigin.

Die Wunderkammer

Die Rudolfinische Kunst- und Wunderkammer z?hlte zu den wichtigsten 
derartigen Sammlungen der ganzen Welt. 37 K?sten enthielten die 
kleineren Gegenst?nde, anderes lag auf Tischen oder war in Truhen 
untergebracht. Rudolf II. ging, vor allem in seinen sp?teren 
Lebensjahren, v?llig in seinen Sammlungen auf. Die politischen Gesch?fte 
des Oberhauptes des R?mischen Reiches deutscher Nation mussten 
zur?ckstehen, wenn es galt, ein neues Sammlungsst?ck zu bewundern. Das 
fiel den Schweden nun alles in die H?nde.
Der schwedische Historiker Peter Englund beschreibt den Umfang des 
Raubes, der an den Hof der schwedischen K?nigin Christina gebracht 
wurde: 69 Bronzestatuen, 29 Gegenst?nde aus Elfenbein, 660 Achatgef??e, 
16 Kunstuhren, 185 Gegenst?nde besetzt mit Edelsteinen, ganze Kisten mit 
Diamanten, tausende wertvolle Medaillen und etwa 500 Gem?lde, darunter 
Bilder von Michelangelo, da Vinci, Rafael, Tizian, D?rer, Bosch und 
Bruegel, sowie eine komplette Bibliothek mit tausenden B?chern und 
Manuskripten.

Prag hat diesen Verlust nie verwunden und immer wieder Versuche 
unternommen, wenigstens einen Teil der Kunstsammlung f?r Ausstellungen 
auszuleihen. Die Schweden trauten dem Frieden nicht, Leihgaben wurden 
immer wieder abgelehnt. Man f?rchtete ? wohl zu Recht ? dass die Werke 
von Prag beansprucht werden und nie wieder nach Stockholm zur?ckkehren. 
Der tschechische Staat machte seinerseits immer wieder seinen ? 
wenngleich nicht unumstrittenen ? Rechtsanspruch geltend. Auch nach der 
Wende von 1989. Anfang der neunziger Jahre ?u?erte sich diesbez?glich 
sogar Pr?sident V?clav Havel. Stockholm zeigte ihm die kalte Schulter. 
?Ein solcher Anspruch ist zweifelhaft, weil so alle europ?ischen Museen 
leer ger?umt w?rden?, lautete die Antwort aus Schweden.

Paroubek erhielt einen Korb

17 Jahre sp?ter lenkt Schweden wenigstens in einem Fall ein. Als 
Tschechiens Premier Mirek Topol?nek vergangene Woche Stockholm besuchte, 
durfte er die Teufelsbibel ansehen und die Nachricht verk?nden, dass der 
wertvolle mittelalterliche Kodex nach 357 Jahren wieder nach Prag kommen 
und auf einer Ausstellung des Nationalmuseums von September 2007 bis 
Januar 2008 zu sehen sein wird. Wie sensibel die Leihgabe aber zu 
behandeln ist, wei? der Politiker. ?ber R?ckgabeanspr?che wollte er 
gegen?ber einer tschechischen Tageszeitung ?nicht einmal im Fl?sterton? 
sprechen.

Sein Vorg?nger Ji?? Paroubek hatte sich noch vor zwei Jahren in 
Stockholm einen Korb geholt. Auch er ersuchte bei seinem Schweden-Besuch 
im Herbst 2005 um die Ausleihung der kostbaren Handschrift und betonte, 
dass Tschechien keine Zweifel hege, dass die Bibel Eigentum der Schweden 
sei. ?Wir wollen sie nur ausleihen, selbstverst?ndlich ist dies keine 
Restitution von Eigentum?, hatte Paroubek gegen?ber seinen schwedischen 
Gespr?chspartnern betont. Vergebens. Erst ? wie in Prag verlautbarte ? 
nach komplizierten Verhandlungen sind die Schweden nun bereit, die in 
der Fachwelt als ?Kodex gigas? bekannte Teufelsbibel an Prag auszuleihen

Frank Collection: Questions arise over artwork?s ownership

By ANNE CONSTABLE | The New Mexican
April 26, 2007

Carvings allegedly disappeared from church after 1969

An Arroyo Hondo man has identified two Cristos in the collection of 
Spanish colonial religious art owned by Larry Frank as pieces that 
disappeared from Our Lady of Sorrows church.

The state appropriated $3 million during the last legislative session to 
buy the 263-piece collection and is currently assessing its contents.

Larry Herrera said two large carvings by Juan Miguel Herrera vanished 
from the church north of Taos sometime after 1969. Many parishioners, 
like Herrera, believed they were in the Frank collection.

In Holy Trinity Church in nearby Arroyo Seco there is a photograph of 
the sacristy room of Our Lady of Sorrows. Herrera pointed out that on 
the back of the framed picture an unidentified person has written, ?El 
Se?or Jesus Nazareno is missing ? either sold unlawfully or ? stolen!?

Last week, Herrera met with Frank?s widow, Lycee, who directed him to 
the two pieces, saying, ?These are the ones you want to look at.?

One is a crucified Christ in a loin cloth and the second is a standing 
Christ dressed in red. Both are about 5 feet tall.

Lycee Frank said the couple purchased both pieces from Marcos Ortiz and 
Narcisso Arellano, both now deceased, for an undisclosed amount. She 
also confirmed that Marcos? brother, Manuel, 94, sold the Franks the 
morada that became their home and where the collection is currently located.

Herrera said Arellano was the last member of the Roman Catholic 
brotherhood associated with the morada.

The carver, Juan Miguel Herrera, was born in Arroyo Hondo in 1835 and 
died in 1903. He produced most of his work from the 1870s to the 1890s. 
The Franks owned a number of his Cristos that were valued between $6,400 
and $40,000 in a 2005 appraisal. That document estimated the entire 
collection was worth $4.8 million.

According to Herrera, the sellers did not have the authority to dispose 
of them. ?These were made for the churches; they were never intended for 
the hermanos,? Herrera said, referring to the Brotherhood of the Penitentes.

He said he told Lycee Frank that both pieces should be returned to the 
church in Arroyo Hondo, but she said it was ?too late for that.?

In an interview Wednesday, Lycee Frank said there have been no 
discussions with the state about ?repatriating? the pieces. The sale of 
the collection is ?all over? she said, and questioning the provenance of 
pieces in it is a ?lot of nonsense.?

?The less in paper about this the better I like it,? she added.

But Herrera wrote in a column in The New Mexican earlier this month that 
the provenance of the pieces is ?relevant to those of us who are 
descendants of the hermanos, creators of the santos and builders of the 
moradas. A culture and its intrinsic parts do not belong in the market 
place.?

Herrera said Lycee Frank also showed him two retablos previously 
associated with San Francisco de Asis in Ranchos de Taos.

Herrera said he got interested in the missing pieces while working on a 
restoration at Our Lady of Sorrows.

The state recently hired Joan Caballero to appraise the collection as 
part of its plan for assessing and purchasing the artworks. Various 
groups of experts have recently visited the Frank morada, including 
representatives from the Department of Cultural Affairs, santero and 
author Charles Carrillo, and Jos? Archuleta, the hermano mayor of the 
Morada de Chamita who has also been looking into missing devotionals.

The next scheduled visit is May 17, and that group includes the state 
historian, a Spanish Market artist and members of the Museum of New 
Mexico Board of Regents.

The board is the group that must ultimately decide to accept the 
collection, and its thinking is not clear. In private and in public 
meetings, some members have expressed concerns about the purchase.

One worry in the museum world is that potential donors might in the 
future ask the state to buy their artworks in lieu of making a bequest.

Burglary At National Arts Gallery Thwarted 

New Era (Windhoek) 
NEWS
April 27, 2007 
Posted to the web April 27, 2007 

By Frederick Philander
Windhoek 

An attempted burglary at the Namibia National Arts Gallery in the early
hours of last Friday morning was thwarted in the nick of time, thanks to the
alarm system and the quick response of a local security company. 

The PRO of the NNAG, Paul Hamman, told Art/Life that nothing was stolen from
the premises. 

"The attempted burglary occurred at 04h00 on Friday. The culprits tried to
break down the front door. However, the would-be thieves ran away when the
alarm system went off and security guards shortly thereafter rushed onto the
scene. It could have been catastrophic, bearing in mind that the valuable
national art collection is stored in a vault in the building," a relieved
Hamman said. 

The incident happened the same day on which the director of the gallery,
artist Joseph Madisia, left on a week-long art management business trip to
Germany, by courtesy of the American Cultural Centre. This was apparently
the first attempt by hooligans to try and break into the building since
Madisia took over the management of the gallery. 

"The audacious thugs abortively tried to gain forced entry through the front
door," said Hamman, who confirmed that heavily armed security guards are now
guarding and patrolling the government entity on a full time basis. 

Director Joseph Madisia returned to the country yesterday. 

Other African galleries have in the past suffered tremendous damages due to
senseless burglaries in which irreplaceable artworks, considered to be the
pride of any nation, were stolen and never recovered. 

"I suspect this was purely an ordinary burglary and not an organized and
sophisticated attempt to steal artworks," a relieved Hamman said. 

Several art exhibitions are currently on display at the Namibia National Art
Gallery.

Carry the chariot home 
Saturday, April 28, 2007
BY MICHAEL ROVELLO

When Hamilton Township Mayor Glen Gilmore visited the village of Monteleone
Di Spoleto, the people of the village at a public meeting pleaded for help
in getting back an ancient Etruscan chariot, a priceless work of art found
in their village ("Relic sparks a family affair," April 11). The chariot is
on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, where
officials claim that they paid for it. They have since refused to make
further comment. 

It has been the custom over the years for wealthy patrons of the arts to go
around the world and scoop up works of art for peanuts from destitute and
unsophisticated people. Many times, the treasures are spoils of war;
sometimes they have simply been appropriated. That is how art treasures left
China and Egypt and Peru and Mexico. 

One of the most egregious examples of the plundering of another country's
art is the story of the Elgin Marbles taken from the Parthenon 200 years ago
in a deal with Turkey, the country that ruled Greece for a brief time. Not
only did bribes enter the picture, but Lord Elgin paid a pittance for the
priceless Parthenon statuary and friezes he sent to England. Greece has been
demanding their return ever since. (See "Imperial Spoils: The Curious Case
of the Elgin Marbles" by Christopher Hitchens.) 

Some very interesting points Hitchens makes concerning the Elgin Marbles
describe the specious arguments that the British have used to justify their
expropriation: If all artifacts were returned, museums would have to close;
more people are able to see them in the British Museum; they are less prone
to pollution damage; they are well cared for; they paid for them. The
suggestion was made by one of The Times' readers that he would prefer to see
the chariot remain in the Metropolitan Museum for some of the very same
reasons -- reasons that I find arro gant, patronizing and unconvinc ing. 

The King Tut exhibit, which is enjoying its second U.S. tour in 30 years, is
only one example that destroys all but the final argument. Museums draw
enormous crowds with their traveling exhibits that, by visiting multiple
sites, draw people from distances too far removed to see them in a single
location. Even when traveling, exhibition items are meticulously preserved.
As for paying for the artifacts, ownership of expropriated property is
dubious, even when efforts are made to legitimize it using the name of a
highly regarded museum. The net effect of such an action is to render
questionable the esteem felt for the institution. 

More than three-quarters of the world's art treasures are located in Italy.
The Italians are the world's greatest restorers and preservers of art and
ancient artifacts, and they are perfectly capable of caring for their
chariot as well. The Etruscan chariot does not belong in the Metropolitan
Museum of Art. It should be restored to its rightful owners, the people of
Monteleone Di Spoleto, who beg for its return.
