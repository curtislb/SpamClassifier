Another example

Lilly sells duloxetine as Cymbalta for depression and Yentreve for
incontinence. Interesting that EU was quick to approve Yentreve on very weak
evidence but Lilly actually withdrew their US application because they
understood that FDA would not approve it....

There are probably several reasons for this trend. I worry that by giving
psychotropic drugs different brand names, doctors forget that they are
actually prescribing 'strong medicines' for non-psychiatric disorders.

Also, can anyone explain, or recommend someone who can comment on, the
benefits that pharmaceutical companies get (patent or exclusivity
extensions or otherwise) when they remarket a drug with a new name or
for a new use?
