Have you done a successful installation of the intel on an etch laptop?  
I did a locate and it appears that wireless tools and the ieee files 
came with the install, so I've not bothered to download and install 
them.  My firmware files are in place yet when I try to do the make on 
the ipw2200_110 file nothing executes.  Am stumped at this point.  Maybe 
bad files in firmware or ipw downloads, so shall start by re-downloaded 
those and putting them in clean.
Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Jim

My ipw firmware files are in /lib/firmware, where I think you said
yours were, and I am not having any problems with them.

Inquiring mind would like to know.
