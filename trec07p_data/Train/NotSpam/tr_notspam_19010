A major computer shutdown in the Russian segment of the international space=
 station has triggered around-the-clock troubleshooting to resolve the prob=
lem before the shuttle Atlantis departs next week. Russian engineers believ=
e the computer glitch may have been related to the addition of a new set of=
 U.S. solar arrays Monday and subtle changes in the station's electrical po=
wer grid, mass distribution or other properties. Engineers are assessing a =
variety of possibilities.

Without the guidance and control computers, Russian maneuvering rockets can=
not be fired to make changes in the station's orientation that are beyond t=
he capability of the lab's control moment gyroscopes. NASA managers said to=
night they are confident Russian engineers will get to the bottom of the pr=
oblem but in the meantime, shuttle planners are looking into power conserva=
tion measures to permit an additional docked day if required. While the shu=
ttle is docked, its own thrusters can be used to maintain the station's ori=
entation as required. But the Russian computers must be functioning before =
the shuttle departs. A detailed story will be posted here shortly.
