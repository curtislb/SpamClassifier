Hello sm1lies,

Microsoft invites you to join in the latest Connected Services Framework (CSF) competition, and help build a Web-based tool for the Microsoft Connected Services Framework Session Management component. 

The challenge is to write a Web-based tool -- preferably using Silverlight (http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/) -- that can connect to a CSF Session Manager Web Service, obtain a list of sessions that already exist, and perform a variety of other tasks.

The prizes for this competition are: 
* First prize - $3,000
* Second prize - $1,000
* Third prize - $500

Learn more and register here: http://csf.topcoder.com/?module=Static&d1=assembly&d2=msSessionManifestDetails

Best of luck to you in the CSF Competition Series!
