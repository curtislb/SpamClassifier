Today's woot (6/1):

I hid my yo-yo in the garden
When you are immersed in a magical world that seems to be the sort of
thing that a young Kate Bush would paint on the side of her favorite
van, the last thing you want to do is be able to hear the mundanes out
on your lawn. And you can write a program to count thirty minutes from
the time you type /pizza all by yourself. For you we offer Everglide
S-500 Professional Gaming Headphones, which will help those precious
ears keep to the path to electronic fame and fortune. The Everglide
S-500 Professional Gaming Headphones are designed for comfort, as is
the ultra-light membrane and the over-sized leather muffs, which
strongly remind one of the older Kate Bush. You also get a protective
carrying bag, which can be placed over your head in the event you
should need to hide from Ms. Bush’s lawyers, and a clip-on microphone,
which you could clip to your shirt if you ever wore one while playing
MMORPGs. Drown out the cries of your editor trying to explain how
libel works in the United Kingdom and scurry back to your impossibly
proportioned Night Elf and your Collected Works of Mercedes Lackey
audiobooks in crystal clear quality thanks to the Everglide S-500
Professional Gaming Headphones.
Warranty: One year

_They call me naughty Lola: Personal ads from the London Review of
Books_

Pg 108:
Are you Kate Bush? Write to obsessive mand (36) at box no 7363.  Note:
people who aren't Kate Bush need not respond.

Pg 148:
She signed the letter 'All yours, Babooshka'.[2] Little did I know
that Babooshka wasn't, in fact, my wife trying to catch my infidelity
(thanks for nothing, Kate Bush), but a gorgeous East European minx
looking for no-strings love and a place to rest her tired head every
now and again.  If only I'd realized when I replied with a parcel of
my smalls and a request to use non-bio (I have very sensitive skin).
The bad-luck fairy sits permanently on the shoulders of male doofus
(38) at box no 3121.

[2] Taken from 'Babooshka', single released by Kate Bush in July 1980.
The song relates the story of a man who is sent a sequence of
love-letters.  He falls in love with the writer, reminded by their
contents of his wife in the early days of their relationship 'when she
was beautiful'.  The author of the letters is, in fact, his wife who
is writing under the assumed identity of Babooshka in an attempt to
prove her husband's adultery.  Reached number five in the UK charts.

This past weekend, my inlaws were over helping around the house.  My
BIL (a former actor) said to me, "You would be great backstage in the
theatre.  You've got gaffers tape on everything!"  I challenged this
statement - "where is there gaffa!?'  and he held up a can of my
hairspray with a carefully wrapped cap.  The cap had broken and I
didn't want the nozzle to dry up so I taped the crack in the cap;
carefully aligning the edge of the tape to the edges of the cap.

oh.  yeah.

He also said "you even knew what I meant when I said 'gaffer's tape'"

Isn't it also called GAFFA sometimes?

he didn't know, but he DID ask "what's gaffa" and I groaned and said
"that is a subject that we don't broach!" and played the song.
