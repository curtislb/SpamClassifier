Dear reader,



this month <http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/6/en/index.html>  marks the start of new rules governing how WHO's 193 Member States will handle disease outbreaks and other emergencies with potential international public health implications. In an editorial, Adrian K Ong and David L Heymann explain why it was vital to revise the International Health Regulations <http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/6/06-037200.pdf>  (IHR) and the implications of these for WHO's Member States. In this month's interview, Guénaël Rodier, director of International Health Regulations Coordination, describes some of the challenges Member States face as they prepare to take on their new responsibilities associated with the IHR.



John Walley et al. discuss the difficulties of translating research <http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/6/07-042531.pdf>  results into action. In another editorial, Kenji Shibuya discusses the need for meaningful data <http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/6/07-042887.pdf>  to monitor progress towards health targets, such as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).



In the News section, Hannah Brown reports on how a government campaign to make  roads <http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/6/07-010607/en/index.html>  safer in Rwanda helped with the rehabilitation of a nation traumatized by the 1994 genocide. Jane Parry reports from Hong Kong SAR on two rotavirus vaccines <http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/6/07-020607/en/index.html>  that recently entered the market and of the efforts to ensure they are effective and affordable in developing countries.



Zuguo Mei et al. examined whether the standard deviation of height- and weight-based Z-score indicators from the 2006 WHO growth standards <http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/6/06-034421.pdf>  should still be used as a data quality indicator. L Arevshatian et al. analyse whether the African Regional Strategic Plan of the Expanded Programme on Immunization <http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/6/06-031526.pdf>  has met its 2001-2005 goals. Dele O Abegunde et al. found that health workers, who are not qualified doctors, can reliably manage cardiovascular risks <http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/6/06-032177.pdf>  if given three days of focused and appropriate training.



Andrew Page et al. investigated the effect of immigration on life expectancy <http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/6/06-036202.pdf>  in Australia from 1981 to 2003. In another paper, Abla Sibai et al. took a novel approach to estimating mortality <http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/6/06-032847.pdf>  trends of older men and women in Lebanon by using data based on interviews with offspring.



Tie-Wu Jia et al. estimated the age-specific disability weight of chronic schistosomiasis japonica <http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/6/06-033035.pdf>  in China. Mark Colvin et al. found that the rates of early transmission of HIV <http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/6/06-033639.pdf>  using single-dose nevirapine administered both to mothers and their children in South Africa were similar to those obtained in clinical trials in Cameroon and Kenya.



Chandrakant Lahariya analyses the current strategy to eradicate polio <http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/6/06-037457.pdf>  of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, the challenges it faces and possible solutions to these. In their review of literature, Shona Wynd et al. conclude that the sociocultural factors associated with the presence and treatment of lymphatic filariasis <http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/6/06-031047.pdf>  are poorly understood.
