Well I'm not sure. I may be explaining this badly. I'll go thru all  
the details in case it helps.

The path I pass when I'm executing the script is escaped, which I  
assume is correct.

Once that path is read by Getopt, I print it and, voila, no escapes,  
just nice-to-read spaces.

This path gets a filename appended as if it were a regular string,  
and is used to when I make a file (via another module). This file is  
created & written just fine. This made me assume all was well, and  
that Perl or the modules covered all the issues with spaces. I now  
realize this may have been naive.

Then I attempted to use Tidy, sans HTML::Tidy, through Shell. The  
HTML::Tidy lib won't work on my system. So, I have been futzing with  
tidy and I'v e discovered that tidy and simple commands like cd fail,  
most likely because of the spaces in my paths.

For example, here's the path I pass to the script (no quotes):
     /Users/mike/Airline\ Sheets/Original\ Schedules/UnitedJune.html

Here's the path as found via File::Basename/fileparse:
     /Users/mike/Projects/Omni/Airline Sheets/Original Schedules/	

My script uses modules that create files based on this path, and it  
seems okay. If however I try to              use the path with say,  
the Shell mod, it fails. This is what cd returns:

	/Users/mike/Projects/Omni/Airline: No such file or directory
.
I need to use the Shell because I need to run tidy, locally.

That may very well be the case!
