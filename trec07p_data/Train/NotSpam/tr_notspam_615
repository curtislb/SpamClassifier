There are two points in docs/submission.pod where the word 'test' is  
used is a way which, IMHO, is confusing.

1.  Lines 24-29

   Generally, when adding a *new test* you should add a new step  
unless a test
   I<clearly> belongs in a current step. For example, if we added a new
   user-configurable type called C<FOOVAL>, you should add the test  
for its size
   in F<config/auto/sizes.pm>; however, if you were testing what  
dynaloading
   capabilities are available, you should create a new step.
     [Emphasis ** added.]

When I come across the phrase 'new test', I immediately wonder what  
the 'old' or 'previous' test might be.  But this is the very first  
time that the word 'test' is used in this document!  The preceding  
paragraph talks a lot about adding new *steps*, but makes no  
reference to adding new *tests*.  This does not appear to mean 'test'  
in the sense of a test you might find in a t/*.t file.

2.  Lines 96-100

   All steps are really classes; they each exist in a unique  
namespace.  The
   namespace used depends on the tests [sic] relative path in the  
source tree minus sans [sic]
   the F<config> prefix.  For example, the step F<config/init/ 
defaults.pm> uses
   the C<init::defaults> namespace.

First of all, it should have been "test's" in the second line to  
indicate the possessive rather than a plural.  Second, you don't need  
both 'minus' and 'sans'; deleting 'minus' would probably be better.

But, here again, the term 'test' appears in this paragraph without a  
preceding reference in this paragraph or the preceding one.  I would  
have expected something more like:

   The namespace used depends on the step's relative path in the  
source tree sans the F<config> prefix.

Since I'm not entirely clear as to what's intended in these two  
locations, I'm not yet providing a patch.  Can anyone clarify?

Thank you very much.
