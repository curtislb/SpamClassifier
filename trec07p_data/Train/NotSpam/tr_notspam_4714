USA for Innovation Calls on Administration Officials to Confront
Thailand's Theft of US Property - U.S. Government should elevate
Thailand to the Special 301 Priority Watch List

April 23, 2007

USA For Innovation (www.usaforinnovation.org) today released an open
letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Commerce Secretary Carlos
M. Gutierrez, Secretary of Health and Human Services Michael O. Leavitt
and U.S. Trade Representative Susan C. Schwab reminding them of the
importance of intellectual property (IP) to the American economy and to
encourage them to use this week's visit by Thailand's Minister of Health
Mongkol Na Songkhla to confront the recent threats by Thailand to seize
patents owned by American companies.

Earlier this month and in anticipation of the Special 301 Report
annually issued at the end of April, USTR noted that Thailand continues
to suffer from .widespread commercial IPR counterfeiting and piracy..
The new Thai military regime, which assumed power by coup last
September, has now introduced direct government theft of American
innovation into the quickly deteriorating U.S.-Thailand relationship
through its theft of the intellectual property of three drugs produced
by American and European companies. These drugs, for HIV/AIDS and heart
conditions cost billions of dollars to develop and market.

In the open letter, USA for Innovation urges the U.S. Government to
educate the new Thai government on the consequences of its endorsement
of dismantling IP protection when Minister of Health Mongkol Na Songkhla
visits Washington for high-level government-to-government meetings. In
addition, the U.S. Trade Representative should elevate Thailand to the
Priority Watch List in its Special 301 Report to be released at the end
of April.

."Our letter sends a clear message to the U.S. Government about the
importance of protecting American IP from theft by the Government of
Thailand,". said Ken Adelman, Executive Director of USA for Innovation
and a former US Ambassador to the United Nations. ."We encourage
Thailand to reconsider the compulsory license of American products.
Moving forward would represent a further weakening of the US-Thai
partnership and raises the possibility of U.S. retaliation against the
Kingdom,." said Adelman.

."This latest action is so disturbing because it comes from the Thai
government,." Adelman said. ".Theft of American innovations by vendors
on the streets of Bangkok is bad enough. Sanctioning, endorsing and
promoting to other countries a movement to steal U.S. assets in public
health care systems around the world is something else entirely. It
especially hurts coming from a long-standing ally of the United States.."

A scholarly paper commissioned by USA For Innovation finds intellectual
property squarely at the heart of American economic growth -- "The
Economic Value of Intellectual Property" by economists Dr. Robert
Shapiro and Dr. Kevin Hassett quantifies the value of American
intellectual property at $5 - 5.5 trillion, equivalent to about 45
percent of U.S. GDP and greater than the GDP of any other nation in the
world

Excerpts of the letter:

-  Thailand's Minister of Health Mongkolna Songkhla is in Washington
D.C. this week and is scheduled to meet with Members of Congress and top
officials of the Administration, including Secretary Gutierrez and
Ambassador Schwab.'s deputy Karan Bhatia. These meetings present an
excellent opportunity for U.S. policymakers to remind Thailand of its
obligations in the global trading system, the numerous benefits the
government of Thailand receives through U.S. preference programs, the
importance of intellectual property (IP) protection to American
interests, and concerns that recent actions by the new government in
Thailand threaten our allied bilateral relationship..

-  In September of last year, the military assumed control of the
government in Thailand, and appointed new officials throughout the
government. Failure in the new regime appears to be systemic..

-  The important distinction between theft of American assets on the
streets of Bangkok and theft of American assets in Thailand.s public
health care system is that the latter is sanctioned, endorsed and
promoted by the government of Thailand..

-  When Thailand's Ministry of Health issues a compulsory license, it
does so to the GPO, a historically corrupt state-owned, for-profit
monopoly..

-  In 2002 Thailand's then-Auditor-General Jaruvan Maintaka issued a
report saying that the GPO sold about 60% of its medical products to
government agencies at above market prices. In some cases, prices were
marked up 1,000 percent..

-  Even more disturbing than Thailand's desire to rob American
innovation for the sole benefit of building up its state-owned drug
company are the implications such actions have on public health in
Thailand. For starters, the facilities used by GPO to manufacturer these
HIV/AIDS medicines have not been approved by the World Health
Organization for meeting basic internationally acceptable standards for
safety and efficacy. Even worse are the resistance levels Thai patients
are developing as a result of shoddy medicines distributed by the GPO..

-  Thailand's Minister of Health has repeatedly claimed that compulsory
licenses are necessary because "we don't have enough money to buy safe
and necessary drugs for the people under the government's universal
health scheme." This claim comes at a time when new military leaders
awarded themselves wage increases totaling $9 million and raised
military spending by more than 30%, or $1.1 billion..

-  Consider additional measures to protect American intellectual
property in Thailand, including:

   a. the revocation of benefits accrued to Thailand under the
Generalized System of Preferences; b. the imposition of import tariffs
to redress direct takings by the government of Thailand from American
innovators and legitimate patent holders c. the removal of additional
government aid to the current regime due to concerns over democracy and
corruption..
