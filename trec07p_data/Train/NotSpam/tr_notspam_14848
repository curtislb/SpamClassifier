'Elgin' Marbles will be visible from Athens, say experts

VISITORS to the New Acropolis Museum in Athens, due to open in 2008,
will be issued with extremely powerful long-range 'art binoculars'
(left) to enable them to view the Parthenon Marbles in London when
standing on a specially designed viewing platform hundreds of feet up
on the top floor of the new museum. High-altitude breathing apparatus
will also be provided.

Faced with age-old intransigence from the British Museum, whose
director Neil MacGregor refuses to let his marbles go back to Athens,
the Greeks needed a novel solution. "This is the only way we can allow
our visitors to see the Marbles," said Greek Culture Minister Dave
Praxiteles. "It's true, they're not exactly reunited, but at least
this way if you screw up your eyes and stand on tiptoe and look
really, really hard, you can just see the left ear of the Horse of
Selene over there in Bloomsbury. We're ecstatic."

Earlier this week British Museum director Neil MacGregor mesmerized
visitors to the Hay Fever Festival in Middle England with his
evangelical vision of, "A glorious New Enlightenment with the British
Museum at its epicentre, a cornucopia overflowing with the world's
cultural treasures, including my Elgin Marbles owned by Lord Elgin and
never by the Greeks because the Turks sold them to us legitimately, so
there."

Meanwhile, the sensational art journalist Martin 'Gor' Blimey, who
writes every story in The Mart Newspaper each month, has reported that
the remaining marbles on the Acropolis (left) will be covered in
bubble-wrap and rolled down the hill to their new home in the
Acropolis Museum.

"The Mart Newspaper can report," wrote Mr Blimey, "that this highly
dangerous and incredibly risky and hugely irresponsible operation has
been adopted with absolutely no forward planning and is a terrible way
to treat the surviving masterpieces of one of the world's greatest
monuments and not what the British Museum would have done, but this is
just what we would expect from a barbarous nation such as the Greeks."
