Take a step back and explain your motivations for adding 
'add_vtable_method'?

The :vtable pragma is necessary for defining a .sub as an overridden 
vtable function in PIR code. If you had a replacement in mind, run it by 
the list and we'll discuss it, but we can't just eliminate the feature.

Why would other object systems not use vtable overriding? Vtable 
overriding is a Parrot feature, it's the way high-level classes 
implement their interactions with the virtual machine at a low level. 
Different object systems having different semantics doesn't change the 
fact that they implement those semantics using a combination of vtable 
functions and methods.

Which is part of the spec.
