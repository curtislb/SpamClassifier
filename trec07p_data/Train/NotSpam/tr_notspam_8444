Thanks for this information, Bjorn.
This same problem occurs in the rest of the EU as far as I know.
Here in Belgium this discussion is also running anyway.
A discussion conference to be held after summer with interested  
people and organisations, is in the planning stage.
We will see what comes out. Maybe a petition could be a good idea  
here also ... before or after that.

Good luck,
Pieter
