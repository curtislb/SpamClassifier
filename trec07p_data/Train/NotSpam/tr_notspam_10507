Hmm, that is odd, I am using the mailing list interface, not using the
newsgroups interface.  It sounds like either la.mx.develooper.com is
not properly sending the acknowledgments to nz-out-0506.google.com or
nz-out-0506.google.com is not processing them properly.  I don't know
who is adding on the Newsgroups: header, but it isn't me.  The
following is what I am handing off to Google.  Since I have no control
over either machine my only suggestion is to use a mail reader merges
or discards duplicate Message-IDs.  That will also stop you from
getting dups when I reply to both you and the list (as I am doing now
because I am too lazy to do anything but hit "reply to all").
