CBS NEWS STS-117 STATUS REPORT: 25
Posted: 1:58 PM, 6/8/07

Changes and additions:

   SR-23 (06/07/07): Weather improves to 80 percent 'go'
   SR-24 (06/08/07): Shuttle Atlantis fueled for launch; weather 80 percent=
 'go'
   SR-25 (06/08/07): Fueling complete; ECO sensors working normally; crew i=
n final preparations

1:58 PM, 6/8/07, Update: Shuttle Atlantis fueled for flight; ECO sensors in=
 good shape; crew preparing for launch=20

The shuttle Atlantis' external tank has been loaded with a half-million gal=
lons of liquid oxygen and hydrogen rocket fuel. Engine cutoff sensors at th=
e bottom of the hydrogen tank are operating normally and the launch team is=
n't working any significant technical issues.

Forecasters continue to expect good weather, saying they expect an afternoo=
n sea breeze to set up as the day wears on, pushing clouds and showers away=
 to the west. The five-minute "in-plane" launch window opens at 7:38:04 p.m.

"To go on the data, which I like to do, then you've got to be optimistic ab=
out launch," said NASA Administrator MIchael Griffin. "The weather guys are=
 saying 20 percent no-go, so 80 percent go, which is about as good as you'r=
e going to do around here this time of year and that time of day. So that's=
 terrific. They're not working anything on the vehicle. Things can always c=
ome up ... but right now, I'm optimistic."

In a brief photo opportunity, commander Rick Sturckow, pilot Lee Archambaul=
t, flight engineer Steve Swanson, Patrick Forrester, Danny Olivas, Jim Reil=
ly and space station astronaut Clay Anderson were relaxed and smiling as th=
ey sat around a dining table in crew quarters.

They plan to don their bulky pressure suits shortly and to head for launch =
pad 39A around 3:47 p.m. to strap in for launch.
