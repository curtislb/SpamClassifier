Kate Bush Angers Neighbors With Privacy Demands

Kate Bush Singer Kate Bush has angered her neighbors after installing 
hi-tech security systems all over her $5 million English estate and 
claiming a public footpath as her own land. The Wuthering Heights star - 
who lives in the South Hams peninsula on the Devon coast - has installed 
CCTV cameras on a nearby beach so she can spy on the public 
thoroughfare, according to British newspaper Mail On Sunday.

A resident says, "She's since had the original path re-cut for her own 
use and we've heard she might be trying to get it closed to the public 
now because four solid fence posts have been driven into the side of the 
hill... But she can't do that. It's a right of way and she knew that 
when she bought the place."

A councilor adds, "I'm afraid the coast path and the beach were there 
long before Kate Bush and I'm fairly confident they'll still be in the 
same place with the same unhindered access long after she's gone."
