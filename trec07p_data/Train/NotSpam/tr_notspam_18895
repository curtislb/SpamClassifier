Lou Dobbs Tonight
Wednesday June 13, 2007

Lou published a new commentary on CNN.com today on why
President Bush should give it a rest already: “President Bush
is building his legacy, adding another unfortunate line of
hollow bravado to his rhetorical repertoire. To ‘Mission
accomplished,’ ‘Bring it on,’ ‘Wanted: Dead or alive,’ and of
course, ‘I earned ... political capital, and now I intend to
spend it,’ he has added ‘I'll see you at the bill signing,’
referring to his own ill-considered push for so-called
comprehensive immigration reform legislation.”

Visit http://cnn.com/loudobbstonight to read the
rest of Lou’s latest commentary…

Tonight on the broadcast, is the Middle East on the verge of
all-out war? A bomb today exploded a famous Shiite shrine in
Iraq, a powerful car bomb in Beirut killed an anti-Syrian
Lebanese politician and nine other people, and fierce battles
are spreading into Central Gaza. How far are we from full-scale
warfare in the region? We’ll discuss that tonight.

Pro-illegal alien supporters begin their “Dreams Across
America” tour today. They are heading to Capitol Hill on four
“Dreamers” trains from across the country to promote amnesty,
despite the failure of the Senate's "comprehensive immigration
reform" bill last week. We'll have a special report.

We'll discuss the very latest in the illegal immigration debate
with the head of one organization that helped craft the grand
compromise. Janet Murguia, President of the National Council of
La Raza, is our guest this evening.

The Department of Transportation is pressing ahead with its
Mexican cross-border trucking program, but not without backlash
from groups who say they are disregarding safety regulations
outlined in legislation signed by President Bush. Many groups
are concerned the program opens America’s borders up to major
safety concerns and possibly terrorism. Are they right? Find
out tonight.

Two Pentagon officials testified today before the House Armed
Services Committee on the security risks China poses to the
United States. The officials warned the lack of transparency
from China on its growing military spending could prompt the
U.S. to only assume the worst about their intentions.

And more than 1.2 million students will not graduate this year,
according to a new report from the Editorial Projects in
Education Research Center. The organization's director,
Christopher Swanson, joins Lou tonight to talk about this
alarming trend.

Lou Dobbs lays out his manifesto to save the middle class in
his new book, “War on the Middle Class: How the Government, Big
Business, and Special Interest Groups Are Waging War on the
American Dream and How to Fight Back.” War on the Middle Class
is now on sale in bookstores near you and on Amazon.com and
BarnesandNoble.com.
