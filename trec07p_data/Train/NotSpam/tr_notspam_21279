Hello,

for a few days i try to get into Glade. So far it looks very interesting
and promising to me. But it seems i'm too stupid to understand how
GtkTreeView is working. 
Can someone provide me an easy to understand example or point me to some
howto? I've read a few c- and python howtos, none of them helped me
(well, i'm fairly new to perl and that's the first programming language i
really try to get into). http://gtk2-perl.sourceforge.net/doc/pod/Gtk2/
helped my a lot with other stuff, but just confuses me with TreeView.

thanks

tannhauser
