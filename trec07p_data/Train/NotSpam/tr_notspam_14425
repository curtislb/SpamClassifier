Okay, obviously I have more synopsis to read, but currently Pugs says:
pugs> my $posinf = *
Inf
pugs> my $neginf = -*
-Inf

which made me think * is Inf in scalar context.  Is this a bug in Pugs then?

Is Inf the canonical way of spelling the literal "infinity"?

I am patching Pugs' x and xx operators to handle infinity now.  The
behavior after the patch is
pugs> "a" x 5
"aaaaa"
pugs> "a" x 0
""
pugs> "a" x -5
""
pugs> "a" x Inf
Internal error while running expression:
Infinite replications would exahust memory
pugs> "a" x -Inf
""

Besides fixing the spelling error on exhaust and making it a real die
instead of an internal error (which I have yet to figure out how to
do), does this match up with your expectations for the replication
operators?
