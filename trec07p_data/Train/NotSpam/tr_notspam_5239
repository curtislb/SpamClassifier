Since November I've been working on maintaining those of Parrot's 
configuration and build tools written in Perl 5.  Lately I've been 
trying to recruit others to help in that process.  The discussion in 
this thread suggests that at some future point some or all of the Perl 
scripts/modules I've been working on will be replaced with ... something 
else.

This, of course, makes me wonder what I'm doing now and, more 
importantly, makes me wonder what to say to other people with Perl 5 
skills who want to help with the Parrot project.

This is not simply an ego thing on my part.  I've written very little of 
the Perl 5 tools and taken on maintenance of a bit more, but one thing I 
realize is how much of Parrot's source code is written in Perl 5.  How 
much of that must eventually be replaced?

And who is going to maintain it?  In my experience Perl 5 programmers 
are relatively abundant while C programmers (these days) are rarer.  How 
many people might actually learn the yet-to-be-designed HLL that would 
presumably replace a lot of the Perl 5 we currently use?

So, can someone draw a roadmap of:

-- *which parts* of Parrot's configuration and build tools *need* to be 
replaced with something else;

-- *why* that replacement is necessary;

-- *when* in the design process that replacement must take place; and

-- *how* that replacement will be maintained going forward from there?

If this is already discussed in some of the design documents, I would 
appreciate a link.  Thank you very much.
