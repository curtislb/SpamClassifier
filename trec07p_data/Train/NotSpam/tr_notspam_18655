Thanks.  I didn't catch that out of the README other than for swat and
registry.

Yes - this happens with just about every network operation (login,
folder access, file access, etc).

Strange thing today - the system can't find SYSVOL.  The only thing I've
done is power down and restart the box since yesterday.  I've even
bounced the SMBD processes.  I may blow out and rebuild again.

I'd love to try to help get Samba 4 up and out the door.  I am an open
source evangelist at work and, other than that, a relatively strong
"anything but MS" advocate  I'm a bit of a hack at coding (I'm the
system administrator of my lab at work, but do SQL database work
primarily).  I can test and even understand most of the code when I read
it.  But unfortunately I am not much of a writer.  If you point me in a
general direction in the code I will go and figure out what it is doing
and make sense of it there to resolve my problems and possibly shine
some light on solutions.

Regards,
Frank
