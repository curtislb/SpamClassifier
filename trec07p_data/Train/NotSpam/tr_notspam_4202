Handbook helps Jewish families claim stolen art

AFP, BERLIN
Monday, Apr 23, 2007, Page 6

In the wake of sensational sales of art that was seized by the Nazis,
German authors have published the first handbook to help Jewish families
win back masterpieces that are still in the wrong hands.
The 528-page tome Nazi Looted Art -- Art Restitution Worldwide is sold as
a do-it-yourself law manual for heirs of Holocaust victims hoping to
confront museums and collectors in different corners of the world in a bid
to recover lost canvasses.

Co-author Gunnar Schnabel makes an educated guess that "there are still
thousands of masterpieces and tens of thousands of lesser paintings that
should be returned to the rightful heirs.

"For example, some 30,000 art works were taken out of France, but 16,000
never resurfaced. It is the museums' policy to keep all of this top
secret. There are works in basements and vaults," Schnabel, a lawyer who
handles restitution claims, said.

Even before it hit the shelves last month, the book he wrote with
historian Monika Tatzkow was adding to pressure on the German government
to return a painting from the Biedermeier era featured on its cover.

The work, Fiat Justitia by Carl Spitzweg, formed part of the German
government's art collection for decades after World War II.

But it originally belonged to Jewish trader Leo Bendel, who died in the
Buchenwald concentration camp in 1940.

In February, as articles about the book appeared in most Austrian and
German newspapers, the German finance ministry announced it would return
the painting to the Bendel heirs.

Schnabel and Tatzkow said they hope to force museums to investigate the
provenance of their works and come clean on art they obtained thanks to
the Nazis' systematic seizure of Jewish collections that peaked in the
early 1940s.

German museums panicked last year when Berlin's Bruecke Museum had to part
with Ernst Ludwig Kirchner's Berlin Street Scene, a prized Expressionist
painting looted from a Jewish shoemaker.

When the claimant let Christie's auction the work and it was bought by US
cosmetics magnate Ronald Lauder for US$38 million, curators began bracing
for a flood of claims from heirs hoping for a windfall from a buoyant art
market.

Lauder is famous for collecting restituted art and an obvious target for
criticism that a moral issue is being commercialized.

His first piece was a Van Gogh drawing discovered by Tatzkow which he
bought for 7 million euros (US$9.5 million), but in 2005 he paid a record
US$135 million for Adele Block Bauer I, an iconic portrait by Secessionist
-- the Austrian name for Art Nouveau -- artist Gustav Klimt, after it was
restituted to the sitter's niece.

"It's only about money and speculation," Martin Roth, the director of
Dresden's State Art Collection, complained recently.

Museums such as the Bruecke say they cannot afford to follow the example
set by Vienna's Leopold Museum, which invited scrutiny of the origins of
its unrivalled Egon Schiele collection.

It has also spent millions contesting a claim for the Austrian artist's
Portrait of Wally.

But ahead of an international conference on looted art taking place in
Potsdam near Berlin next week, historian Julius Schoeps said: "I think the
museums also lack the will."

He advised museums to loan out works to raise funds to pay out claimants
as a way of keeping their collections intact.

Schnabel thinks there "is not enough money to buy back all the paintings
the Nazis stole," but said in his experience museums are not prepared to
pay even modest reparations.

"Initially, with the Kirchner painting, the granddaughter was happy to
accept a sum below the market price but the museum refused," he said.

Tatzkow has accused museums of playing for time in the knowledge that the
generation of Jews whose parents perished in the Holocaust will not be
around forever.

"They are trying to sit the problem out, to wait for time to pass," she said.

"The story of a missing artwork will eventually get lost in a family. The
children will know something but once they are dead, restitution becomes
more difficult," she said.

Tableau de 100.000 euros vol? dans un mus?e ? Malines
Un tableau du peintre malinois David Vinckboons a ?t? vol? vendredi au
mus?e Hof van Busleyden, ? Malines. Sa valeur est ?valu?e ? quelque
100.000 euros. Les voleurs ont agi en plein jour et ont disparu sans
laisser de trace, a indiqu? la police de Malines.

Le conservateur du mus?e a constat? le vol vendredi apr?s-midi. L'oeuvre
s'intitule "Sc?ne de chasse dans un bois" et date du d?but du dix-septi?me
si?cle. Elle mesure ? peine 15 centim?tres sur 20. Les voleurs ont disparu
sans laisser de trace. Le mus?e Hof van Busleyden ne poss?de pas de cam?ra
de surveillance.

La police cherche ? savoir si ce vol a un lien quelconque avec deux autres
vols de tableau ? Malines. Il y a un mois, un vol a en effet eu lieu dans
l'?glise du B?guinage. Un tableau avait ?t? subtilis? auparavant dans une
?cole de la Melaan. (belga)

Lost altar masterpieces found in spare bedroom fetch ?1.7m

Italian ministry outbid by private buyer in Dorset sale of Fra Angelico
saints

Steven Morris
Friday April 20, 2007
The Guardian

They were discovered behind the door in a pensioner's spare room: two
small panels depicting two saintly figures.
Yesterday, having been identified as the missing pieces of the San Marco
altarpiece by the Renaissance master Fra Angelico, the pieces were sold
for ?1.7m, a record for a sale outside London.

In a former egg-sorting shed at Dorchester cattle market, telephone
bidders pushed the price up. The Italian ministry of art and culture led
the charge, attempting to get back paintings that probably vanished from
Florence during Napoleon's occupation of Italy.

But the Italian ministry was pipped by an anonymous European bidder, and
the fear last night was that after having been lost for two centuries the
delicate paintings may once again disappear.
The paintings, peppered with woodworm holes, resurfaced after languishing
for the last few years on a wall at Oxford librarian Jean Preston's two
up, two down house. She had found them in a box of odds and ends in
America in the 1960s.

She did not realise what they were, but thought them "quite nice" and
mentioned them to her father, who was a collector. He paid a modest ?200
and she inherited them when he died.

Miss Preston, an expert on medieval texts, carried on living an unassuming
life, travelling everywhere by bus or on foot, buying her clothes from a
catalogue and eating frozen meals, not realising she had a fortune hanging
behind the door of her spare bedroom.

It was only after her death last year that the panels came to light, to
the shock of Miss Preston's family and the art world.

The main panel, which is still at San Marco in Florence, shows the Madonna
and child. Eight smaller paintings of saints believed to have originally
been positioned in two rows of four on either side of the central image
were dispersed. Six of the eight are known to be in collections and
galleries around the world: the missing two turned out to be Miss
Preston's.

Yesterday they were to be found in the corner of Duke's saleroom in
Dorset's county town among more standard provincial auction fare:
Victorian seascapes, paintings of kittens and pheasants, bits and pieces
of dubious origin.

The bidding for Lot 150 started at ?450,000. It quickly hit the ?1m mark
and kept climbing.

There was a hitch when contact was lost with one telephone bidder, who was
on a train in Kent. But applause broke out as the hammer went down at
?1.7m.

Miss Preston's nephew, Martin Preston, who is selling the panels, said he
planned to celebrate with a beer at his local pub and a week of skydiving.
After tax and the lawyers' fees have been paid and the sum has been split
between a large family, he insists he personally has not made a fortune.

As to what his aunt would have made of the sale, Mr Preston said: "I don't
think it would have meant anything to her. She was not interested in money
but in the artistic worth of things. I just hope they will be seen by the
public. I think that is what Jean would have wanted."

It may be a forlorn hope. Simon Wingett, an art agent who bid in vain for
a private collector, said: "It's been an extraordinary day. A pair like
this may never come up for sale again in our lifetime. And we may never
see them again. That's the reality."

Within an hour the saleroom was clear of the dealers, the agents, the
gawping children and the two nuns who had provided just about the only
non-secular element to the sale.

And then the paintings were whisked out of public sight. The two saintly
figures - one has now been identified as the Dominican missionary St
Vincent Ferrer - spent last night in a bank vault.

They may reappear again soon. But they may be lost for another two
centuries, or more.
