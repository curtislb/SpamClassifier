Thanks John,

That's just the explanation I was looking for. I had hoped that there
would be a built in way of dealing with them with R, but obviously
not.

Given that explanation, it stills seems to me that the way R
calculates n is suboptimal, as demonstrated by my second example:

summary(lm(y ~ x, data=df, weights=rep(c(0,2), each=50)))
summary(lm(y ~ x, data=df, weights=rep(c(0.01,2), each=50)))

the weights are only very slightly different but the estimates of
residual standard error are quite different (20 vs 14 in my run)
