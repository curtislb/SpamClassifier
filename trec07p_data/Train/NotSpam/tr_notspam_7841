Surely the idea of having a separate windows version of R is that
it works in a very Windows-like way and that would preclude
having conflicts with standard utilities on Windows.  To me this
is one of the most annoying things about R since I do use other
Windows software and that includes software that conflicts with R.
In fact, one of the Linux distros I tried to install on top of Windows
conflicted with R since its setup.bat file used find and that's Linux!
After spending quite a bit of time being frustrated with the installation
I finally realized R was the culprit and was really cursing R for having
wasted so much of my time.  Windows should be setting the standard,
not R.

I don't have this sort of conflict problem with any of the other software I use
except R.

One other point.  The multiple UNIX tools in a single executable
I mentioned is called busybox:

http://busybox.net/

Its intended for embedded systems and specific to UNIX systems although its
web page claims its not that hard to get it to work on Windows.  For
example, this UNIX-on-a-floppy distro, tomsrtbt, uses it:

http://www.toms.net/rb/

I mention busybox because you indicated that you were concerned about the
size of the R distro on Windows.
