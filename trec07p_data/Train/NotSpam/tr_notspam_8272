Yes, that's exactly what I want (need) to do.  The configure tests must differ
between the builds so that functions which are available during a
non-developer build will be used, whereas functions that will cause the
compile to barf during a developer build are excluded during a developer
build.

The problem is that these macros use whatever CFLAGS are defined.  If
-Werror-implicit-function-declaration is not defined in CFLAGS during
configure, configure will determine that a function is available when in fact,
during a compile with -Werror-implicit-function-declaration, the compile will
fail.  I don't think it's appropriate for configure to decide a feature should
be used when using it causes the compile to barf.  This is exactly the case I
encountered.  readahead() is available on my system, but is not declared in a
header file, similarly to exit().  Without that flag, a developer configure
will determine that readahead() is available but a compile will fail.  By
consistently testing for and using the warnings-are-errors flag, the problem
is eliminated.  During a developer build, readahead() is found to _not_ exist
so the compilation works fine.  During a production build, readahead() is
found to exist and the compilation works fine since it doesn't use the
warnings-are-errors flag.
