I think some people might find it interesting to review the 2005
Italian compulsory license for patents on the antibiotic Imipenem
Cilastatina.  In this case, there was was a patent in Italy, but no
other European countries.  The Italian generic industries wanted a
license to manufacture the product for sale in European countries
where the patent did not exist.

Italy, like all members of the European Community, agreed to "opt-
out" of the 30 August 03 WTO decision regarding exports of medicine
under a compulsory license.   But the Italian case shows how it can
sometimes be superior to use the solution under 31.k of the TRIPS,
which waives restrictions on exports when the CL is issued as remedy
to anticompetitive practice.  In this case, the CL was a straight
refussal to license, to allow the Italian company to serve a foreign
market.   [None of the conditions for the 30 August 03 decision
(31.bis of TRIPS) apply.]

case MERCK-ACTIVE INGREDIENTS

PRESS RELEASE

PHARMACEUTICALS: ANTITRUST OBLIGES MERCK TO LICENSE MANUFACTURE OF
THE ANTIBIOTIC IMIPENEM CILASTATINA

The Italian Competition Authority has decided to order an interim
measure on Merck & Co. Inc., a company of the pharmaceuticals group
Merck.

This decision, based on EU competition law, is the first case where
an interim measure has been applied by the Italian Competition
Authority.

Merck in Italy has an industrial patent giving it exclusive rights to
the sale of a pharmaceutical product (Tienam) based on the active
ingredient Imipenem Cilastatina. This is an antibiotic intended for
the treatment of particularly serious infections, most often
contracted in hospitals. No patent-right over this product is any
longer held by Merck in other European countries.

The proceedings against the Merck group were begun on 23 February
last, following that group’s refusal to grant a licence for the
production in Italy of Imipenem Cilastatina to be exported for the
manufacture of generic pharmaceuticals in counties not covered by
patents.

Specifically, the Authority’s decision obliges Merck to allow, by
granting a licence, the manufacture and warehousing in Italy of the
active ingredient Imipenem Cilastatina. This will permit chemicals
companies having plants in Italy to be already in a position, at the
completion of the proceedings, to export the product in question to
European countries where Merck has already lost all patent rights, in
advance of the arrival in those markets of generic drugs which will
compete with Merck’s Tienam product.
