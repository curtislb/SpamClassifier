Subject: forking problem with dbd::mysql
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I'm am having an issue with a mysql connection that displays itself when
there's forking going on which I can't track down.

I've made a test program at http://jeremy.kister.net/code/ftest.pl to
demonstrate. I expect this program to print 'SQL RESULT: 1' for as long
as it can.

But instead:

SQL RESULT: 1
SQL RESULT: 1
SQL RESULT: 1
DBD::mysql::st execute failed: MySQL server has gone away at ftest.pl
line 36, <STDIN> line 3.
DBD::mysql::st execute failed: MySQL server has gone away at ftest.pl
line 36, <STDIN> line 3.


What's gone wrong?

perl 5.8.3, sun4-solaris
DBI 1.55
DBD::mysql 3.0007
