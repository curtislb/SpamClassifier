     Following the directions helps too.  In a few areas I used the 
screen attributes function to read the screen colors.  Setting the 
timezone wasn't easy, and I'm probably set to some timezone in Uganda. 
<shrugs>  I'm surprized tzconfig isn't in Slackware, or if it is, it's 
not in the path.  It worked in Debian. <whines>  I'm starting to sound 
like a Windows user with a win-modem.  I'd better shut up.  Gods, it 
feels good to be back at the prompt.
