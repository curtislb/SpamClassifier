If you use lme, you can fit a general correlation structure to the
within-subject data, and compare the fit to a model assuming
uncorrelated within-subjects errors. That should tell you whether your
data are Aren't the G-G and H-F corrections only approximate fixes?
Surely it is better to work with a model that actually fits your data,
rather than using ad hoc adjustments towards a model that doesn't quite
fit. But I'm no psychologist. :-)

The combination of some data and an aching desire for 
an answer does not ensure that a reasonable answer can 
be extracted from a given body of data. - John Tukey.
