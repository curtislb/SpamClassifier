Dear Cabot Wealth Advisory Reader,

What a bull market!  The Dow's hitting new highs.  The Advance Decline
Line reveals a market whose strength and breadth haven't been seen since
2003.  And the sectors participating include all our favorites.

But if you're not heavily invested today, something's wrong.  And I'm
wagering it's that you're worried . . . either about the market or about
actually pulling the trigger to buy individual stocks.

So I've got a special message for you today, and a special offer to boot.

-----

Introducing Cabot Stock of the Month:

A revolutionary investment advisory that brings you Wall Street's top
opportunity on a monthly basis, directly from the editors of Cabot Market
Letter, Cabot Top 10 Report, Cabot China & Emerging Markets Report, and
Cabot Benjamin Graham Value Letter.

I suspect I'm a lot like you. I invest to make money. And the only stocks
I want to invest in are the ones that are going up now.

I hate it when I see a great stock take off and I'm not a part of it. And
I'm sure you feel the same.

Thankfully, as the publisher of the Cabot Market Letter, Cabot Top 10
Report, Cabot China & Emerging Markets Report, and Cabot Benjamin Graham
Value Letter, this situation seldom happens.

The reason is quite simple.

As the publisher of Wall Street's most respected family of investment
advisories, I'm in a unique position to scan the investment horizon and
select the most timely investment opportunities from all of our
publications.

So unlike most investors who are chained to one investment style, waiting
for the market to turn their way, my unique position allows me to choose
among the best stocks that are currently in favor across all investing
styles.

I don't mention this to boast, but this advantage has rewarded me with
many eye-popping returns from across all of our publications.

For example:

    * When Intuitive Surgical represented the best growth story on Wall
Street in August 2004, we quickly named it Stock of the Month. Since then
it's handed investors 600% gains.

    * When we could see that Apple Computer's earnings momentum was
shooting through the roof in October 2004, we named it Stock of the Month.
It was selling for a shockingly low $35 per share. Today, (adjusted for a
2-for-1 split) it has turned a $10,000 investment into $43,000.

    * When the rest of Wall Street felt that Google's best days were
behind in July 2005, our research said the tear would continue. Six months
after we named it Stock of the Month, my readers saw the stock gain an
incredible $160 a share.

And there are 16 more Stocks of the Month I could name that have handed us
an 88% average profit per stock over the past two years, but the reason I
sent you this message isn't to tell you about our past successes, it's to
make sure you have an opportunity to own our next big winners.


Try It Risk Free for the Next 12 Months Grow 50% or Pay Nothing!

I'm Timothy Lutts, and I'm so convinced that the recommendations you'll
read about in Cabot Stock of the Month will make you 50% richer in the
next 12 months, that if they don't, you won't pay a dime.

You might think I'm sticking my neck out on this one, but really I'm not.
That's because each of our Stocks of the Month truly represent the very
best opportunity in the market.

Once you see how we select them, you'll not only understand how we've been
able to post such fantastic returns but you'll also want to add our
monthly recommendations to your holdings.

You see, we don't just pull our monthly recommendations out of a hat. We
start by taking a critical look at the entire investing landscape, paying
particular attention to what kinds of stocks the market is rewarding now.

Then, drawing on the expertise of the editors of Cabot Market Letter,
Cabot Top 10 Report, Cabot China & Emerging Markets Report, and Cabot
Benjamin Graham Value Letter, we pick the one stock that's most likely to
perform well -given these market conditions- in the months ahead.

We call this system spectrum investing because it enables us to use the
wisdom of all our editors, and it gives us the freedom to pick a stock
from any of their publications. The end result gives us the very best
stock on Wall Street for that month. Take a quick look at the results, and
I think you'll agree:

    * Broadvision-up 670%
    * Intuitive Surgical-up 500%
    * Yahoo-up 317%
    * Amazon.com-up 1,290%
    * First Marblehead-up 50%
    * International Game Technology-up 110%
    * eResearch Technology-up 180%
    * NetEase-up 100%
    * Expedia-up 114%
    * Broadcom-up 97%
    * Netflix-up 173%
    * Psychiatric Solutions-up 85%
    * PetroKazakhstan-up 86%
    * Nautilus-up 109%

That's the beauty of Cabot Stock of the Month. It gives us the opportunity
to choose the best stock across all sectors, using our proven spectrum
system.

I don't mention this to boast, but over the past three years, each one of
our picks for Stock of the Month have not only included Wall Street's
biggest winners but also out-performed the indexes by five times - even as
the market slid sideways from January 2002 through December 2004.

Frankly, this is why every one of our recommendations comes with our "50%
richer" guarantee. So should you decide to join us and any of our
recommendations fails to bring you the results I've promised here, you can
cancel and receive a complete refund -no questions asked- even right up to
your last issue.

Should You Say "Yes," Here's What You'll Find in Every Profit Packed
Issue

In each issue, you'll get the facts and analysis behind the
recommendation. You'll know why we selected this stock and the factors
that convinced us it's the best profit opportunity for the current market
conditions.

Economic Outlook: Make no mistake about it; the economy is always
changing. Because economic outlook determines which stocks are in favor or
out, in each and every issue of Cabot Stock of the Month we'll bring you a
panoramic overview of the latest market conditions.

Complete Company Summary: And when I say complete, I mean it. Unlike other
financial advisories that barely scrape the surface, my team of
researchers and I delve so deep into the company's potential and take such
a broad view of the investment landscape that we often know more about the
stock's prospects in the current market climate than the guys running the
company!

Monthly Stock Updates: You'll be glad to know that once we recommend a
stock, our work doesn't end there. We continue to analyze each of our
recommendations and bring you the latest news for as long as it remains on
our recommended list. That way, you'll always have all the information you
need to maximize your profits.

E-mail Alerts: While I've designed Cabot Stock of the Month to bring you
the strongest stock on Wall Street each month, the fact is we're in a
period of unprecedented and dynamic change. So every week we'll send you
an e-mail update discussing our current recommendations. These e-mail
alerts will help you not only take advantage of fast-moving opportunities
in the marketplace but also maximize your profits as market conditions
change.


Let Me Send You This Free Report for Signing Up Today

In this special introduction, I've done my best to show you how we
identify our Stocks of the Month, the kind of results my readers have
captured, and what it's like to be a subscriber.

Of course, the only way you'll really know what it feels like to own Wall
Street's most profitable stocks is to see for yourself.

For simply saying "yes" to my risk-free offer, you'll not only receive a
full year's worth of Cabot Stock of the Month, you'll also receive this
additional wealth-building report: Sector of the Year. It features a
panoramic overview of the no. 1 sector for 2007, along with our top three
recommendations - each of which is on track to deliver 50% gains in 2007.

When you add everything up - the 12 monthly issues, timely e-mail alerts,
free copy of Sector of the Year, and my 50% richer money-back guarantee -
I think you'll agree it would be foolish not to say "yes" to my offer
today and then give me your final answer 12 months from today.

You simply can't lose, especially considering that when you sign up today,
you get...

All this for less than 13 cents per day!

Considering our 88% profit on selected winning stocks - and near 70%
accuracy - you'd think it would cost an arm and a leg to subscribe. Not
true!

In fact, a regular one-year subscription comes to just $77 a year. But for
a limited time, you can sign up today for just $49. That's not only an
introductory savings of 36%, but also just a shockingly low 13 cents per
day for a 12-month subscription.

Why so little?

Because when we started this company 35 years ago, we promised our
subscribers that we would always bring them the most profitable investment
advice on Wall Street at the lowest possible cost. Offering you Cabot
Stock of the Month for about $4 a month is our way of keeping our word.

Considering that our advice has not only beaten the S&P 500 by five times
over the past three years but has also beaten nine out of ten investment
advisors whose recommendations don't even come close, how can you say no?

Again, with our 50% richer guarantee, you have nothing to lose and
everything to gain. I guarantee you'll be glad you did.
