Cue one unsolvable paradox, based on a total mis-understanding.

The GPL v2 is NOT licenced under such a restrictive meta-licence that 
can be a *temporary* exception.

Licence documents MUST be invariant. They are legal documents, with 
legal force, and you're trying to give the recipient the right to mess 
about with them!

And I believe the copyright licence governing the GPL *DOES* allow you 
to mess about with the text, copy it, etc etc (which you're falsely 
claiming it doesn't, I believe). What the GPL does NOT grant you is the 
right to use name "GPL" or refer to the FSF. Which is fine, because they 
are trademarks or company names, so the copyright licence on the GPL 
basically says "do what you like, provided you don't commit the offence 
of 'passing off' ".

Basically, your argument is coming over more and more as "I want to 
rewrite licences to remove all the inconvenient conditions I don't 
like". Which is only going to lay you open to criminal charges for 
fraud, copyright piracy, passing off, or other serious offences like 
that.

Just look at what you're actually going to achieve. You're going to get 
loads of "rights" which are worthless because they're illegal. What's 
the point?

Cheers,
Wol
