Never seemed quite right to me either.  Er, except way back when it did... :/

In P6 such hooks are unnecessary for two reasons:

    * Exception handlers are executed before the stack is unwound, so
	a surrounding dynamic scope can get control at that point.

    * Warnings are just exceptions that default to restarting, so the same
	considerations apply.

And even if we did decide to install some kind of temporizable
global hook for such callbacks, I wouldn't put it into %SIG
these days.  I'm not even sure signals belong in %SIG anymore.
Seems to me they should just be event objects coming in via some
feed to the event-driven underbelly of the program, assuming
we go ahead with a unified events/threads model as suggested by
http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~lipeng/homepage/unify.html.
