This report from the Canada Council for the Arts should also resonate 
with the Bloc.

In the emerging world of e-commerce, small creators may find it more 
difficult to obtain access to intellectual property, some of which may 
formerly have been in the public domain and because of mergers and 
acquisitions and the privatization of databases now come with a fee \ 
attached. 1 5 Artists can thus expect to be whipsawed between the 
prohibitive cost of enforcing their own rights and the rising incidence 
of IP charges.

Government has participated enthusiastically in the raid of the public 
domain, mainly through the imposition of user fees (for example, to much 
of Statistics Canada material) and the contracting out of the management 
of databases and information resources of all kinds. 1 6 From the 
independent artist's point of view the trend is towards ever greater 
costs for access to the same basic information, this being attributable 
solely to the private sector manipulation of the material as content.

In other words small artists in small markets stand to lose the most 
from stronger copyright. This is Quebec.
