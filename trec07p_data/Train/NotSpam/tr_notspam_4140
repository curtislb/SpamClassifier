I learned that in order to pass several directories one has to write

use lib  qw/dir1  ...  dirn/

I would like to pass  the  list from a bash script via  an environment 
variable  such as

use lib $ENV{VAR}

where VAR is set in the bash script depending on some options.

My question:
How do I set the variable in the bash script?
So far I use
VAR="dir1 ... dirn"
export $VAR
but then the content of the variable is interpreted as a single string 
and not a a list of
strings as required by lib.
Is it possible to define in bash a list of strings?

Any help is appreciated.
