I bought a lot of other albums in that 13 years. By the time Aerial came
out, it was just another album, albeit by Kate which at least was a nice
surprise. I had no expectations by that point.

I agree there isn't enough good material to justify a double CD and some of
it is bland.
I think that some of the material is among the best that Kate has ever done
and some of it among the worst. We have 4 great tracks, 4 reasonable
tracks, 3 decent linking pieces, 4 varying but ultimately bland tracks and
one of the least decent Kate singles ever. Overall her 4th best album, just
about nudging The Sensual World into 5th place.
(If KOTM, HTBI, SIB were removed for B-sides and Pi & Nocturn given a good
kicking then this would have been so much better.)
