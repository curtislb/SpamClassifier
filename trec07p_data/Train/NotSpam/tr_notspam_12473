SatCon Wins Air Force Aerospace Generator Contract




BOSTON, May 22, 2007 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- SatCon Technology Corporation(R)
(Nasdaq CM: SATC), a developer and supplier of power management and
system architecture solutions for the alternative energy and distributed
power markets, today announced that it has been awarded a Phase I SBIR
contract with the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory to develop a high
speed, power dense generator for airborne applications in the range of
100-300 kW scalable to the MW-class for directed energy weapon (DEW)
power supplies. 

SatCon is currently developing starter/generators, traction motors, and
generators for ground and undersea vehicles. This award expands SatCon's
portfolio of electric power conversion technologies with the development
of a generator for aerospace applications based on advanced permanent
magnet machinery design concepts. This work is a direct follow-on from
machinery research conducted for the US Army, Ft. Belvoir, for a HMMWV
inline generator and an active development program with the Army
Research Laboratory for a 410kW hybrid electric tactical vehicle
generator. This machine technology has direct applicability to military
and dual-use civilian series hybrid vehicles, on-board vehicle power
(OBVP), and for generator set applications. This concept will also be
scalable to MW-class applications such as airborne directed energy
weapons (DEW) and naval ship power generation. The objectives for this
program are high-speed capability, rugged design, high power density,
and affordable manufacturing capability. 

SatCon's President & Chief Executive Officer, David Eisenhaure, stated
"In addition to opening up opportunities for future military aircraft
power applications, this new SatCon program further solidifies our push
into the hybrid electric vehicle sector for military, commercial, and
passenger applications. SatCon is targeting best in class solutions for
the widest possible range of hybrid electric vehicle and power
conversion applications through a broad array of developments."
