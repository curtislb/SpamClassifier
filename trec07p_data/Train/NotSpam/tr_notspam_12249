Thanks for your response. I was too vague, sorry. I think I want to fit a gls 
model at the lowest level and a mixed effects model with random effects for 
intercept and slope the the highest level.
I dont know if I express that right:
would know how to do using GLS: V=R, R is a "double"block diagonal matrix
would also know how to do w/LME: V=WHW'+ZGZ'+R, R is diagonal
wanted: V=WHW'+R, R is block diagonal.

This is just for my learning purposes to replicate a textbookexample. This 
example has 3 levels. The lowest are 2, possibly more, multivatiate measurements 
(not longitudinal, just to measures, math score and language score in the 
example, ie unstructured covariance matrix). These are nested within individuals 
and the individuals are nested within schools. For the lowest level I would 
choose a gls model for the higher level I would want a lme model both at the 
same time.

Thanks for your thought.
