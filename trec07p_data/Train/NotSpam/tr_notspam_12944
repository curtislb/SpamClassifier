Modern BIOS's (past 10 years or so) are pretty good at autodetecting 
hardware.  If all else fails, make sure all the ide devices in the 
bios are set to audo, or do a CMOS clear to make it redetect 
everything.  Also some bios's (award comes to mind) have an option 
called hdd autodetect that you should run.
