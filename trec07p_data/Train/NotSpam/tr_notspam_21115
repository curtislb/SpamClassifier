Hi Robert,

Let me suggest you a "dirty" solution - if simulations
take days and you must run them many times I would
have rewriten them, let say, in C.  I had a program in
Matlab which took more than an hour to run and I had
to run it many times, so I usually prepared a few
runs, started them in the evening before leaving the
office and got the results next morning.  After a
while I have re-written it in C (this took me a few
days) and got a spead-up factor of about 100, so that
now the run took just a few minutes!
Languages like R and Matlab are extreemely convenient
but if performance is a very important issue you shoul
use C, Fortran, C++, etc.

Regards,

Moshe Olshansky.
