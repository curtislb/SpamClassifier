07:50 a.m., 04/21/07, Update: Soyuz braking rockets fired

With cosmonaut Mikhail Tyurin at the controls, the Soyuz TMA-9's braking ro=
ckets fired at 7:42 a.m., slowing the ship enough to drop it into the atmos=
phere on a trajectory leading to a touchdown in Kazakhstan around 8:30:34 a=
.m. EDT. Tyurin and outgoing space station commander Mike Lopez-Alegria are=
 wrapping up a 215-day mission, a single-flight record for a U.S. astronaut=
. Joining them for the ride home is U.S. businessman Charles Simonyi, who p=
aid the Russians some $20 million to become the fifth tourist to visit the =
station. He blasted off with two new station crew members April 7 and is wr=
apping up a two-week voyage. This status report will be updated after landi=
ng or as conditions warrant.
