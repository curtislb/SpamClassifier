Blind citizens of the United States of America in the United States of 
America have been granted a D.M.C.A. exemption by the Librarian Of 
Congress which permits us to use whatever encryption cracking software we 
can use to crack the codes on D.M.C.A. protected e-books.  Security 
professionals are another class of people with this exemption provided 
they perform the cracking to test vulnerabilities in those systems.  Our 
exemption was granted to help us with access to the contents of those 
e-books.
