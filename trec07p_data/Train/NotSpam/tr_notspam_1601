Also, I found the following line from S03 to be jolting:

    Any       Pair      test object             .STATUS(X) (Str,IO do filetest)

It struck me as a rather specific application for such a generic data type.

I tend to agree that the magic should go away.  However, I already
miss the filetest operators.  Given the way that prefix operators
work, wasn't it already possible to say something like the following?

    given $handle {
        when .'-r' & .'-w' & .'-x' { ... }
        when !.'-w' | !.'-x' { ... }
        when * { ... }
    }

    sort { $^a.'-M' <=> $^b.'-M' }, @files
    sort { .'-M' }, @files

What does pair notation buy us that quoted-postfix notation doesn't
already cover?
