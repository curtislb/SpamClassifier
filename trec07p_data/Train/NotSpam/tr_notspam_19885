While I think things like javascript, flash PDF and some other
technologies are use inappropriately, I think certain ones, thinking of
PDF in particular here, do have there place.

Extending on what I mean about PDF, if the full specifications were
followed properly, and usually this is not done, the situation regarding
PDF should be alot better than it is for us. Unfortunately, software,
both the readers and the writers don't follow this wonderfully, and for
the creating software, if it doesn't follow the specification properly
then no matter how good the reader is the output won't be good (how many
cases can you think of finding untagged PDF), but in most cases the
reader isn't realyy up to it fully either. As I understand it, PDF and
post script is aimed at printing (or the layout), so yes it can be
appropriate to post PDF on the internet if you expect the user to print
it off, but if there is expected online viewing, then there are
certainly more appropriate formats for that (I am thinking of those
scientific papers I would have found useful for my physics that were
online in PDF although mathml is more accessible).

While technology has done alot for me, I do get concerned by various
developments and if theyh are going to create more problems than they
will solve (in my case), eg.e-books and all the security they are
building in to prevent users doing anything to it, how will this impact
on my ability to convert it to a format suitable for me, javascript on
websites (particularly when not needed, sometimes even used when a link
would do the same), etc.
