Lou Dobbs Tonight
Monday May 7, 2007

Tonight, a major storm system this weekend wiped out towns
across Kansas. Ninety-five percent of Greensburg flattened by
an F-5 tornado. We’ll have a report on the path of destruction
and what this means for the families in the affected areas.


Resistance is growing in Canada to the Security and Prosperity
Partnership. The Council of Canadians has published a brochure
called “Integrate This!” laying out numerous concerns about
vast economic integration with the United States. They demand
that lawmakers in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico have a say in
trade negotiations between the three countries. As the next
North American Summit approaches, environmentalists and the
Canadian left are rallying their bases to oppose the SPP. We’ll
have a special report.

Gas prices have hit an all time high in this country. The
national average has reached $3.07 a gallon with some parts of
the country seeing prices as high as $4.00 a gallon. While
middle class Americans struggle to pay for living essentials
like gas, big oil companies are raking in record profits and
blaming high prices on annual capacity issues.	We’ll have full
coverage.

Los Angeles Cardinal Roger Mahony and Los Angeles Mayor Antonio
Villaraigosa held a special Mass "of consolation and healing"
on Sunday for those affected by the pro-illegal immigration
melee at the MacArthur Park rally last week. Join us tonight;
we’ll be taking a close look at the pro-amnesty efforts of the
Catholic Church in Los Angeles.

And, Evangelical Christians are launching a grassroots campaign
today in Washington calling for an amnesty agenda for the
millions of illegal aliens living in America. We’ll have a full
report.

We continue our coverage of the war on drugs in this country.
President of Columbia University's National Center on Addiction
and Substance Abuse Joe Califano joins Lou to discuss his new
book, "High Society: How Substance Abuse Ravages America And
What to do About it."

Visit http://cnn.com/loudobbstonight to read Lou’s
latest commentary on why May Day was a peculiar choice for
illegal immigration demonstrations.

Lou Dobbs lays out his manifesto to save the middle class in
his new book, “War on the Middle Class: How the Government, Big
Business, and Special Interest Groups Are Waging War on the
American Dream and How to Fight Back.” War on the Middle Class
is now on sale in bookstores near you and on Amazon.com and
BarnesandNoble.com.
