Dear Dr Md Sayedur Rahman Khasru,

Reference to your questions posted in IP-health on 31st May and Ms Anne St Martin's response, I wish to point out the following:

Bangladesh is governed by the Patent Act 1911 which provides product patents.  In view of this Act Bangladesh would be under obligation to grant product patents.  The Bangladesh national pharmaceutical companies will not be able to manufacture the patented product without taking a compulsory license from the Bangladesh patent authority.  The question of export will be governed by the procedure laid down by the WTO in the Ministerial meeting in Hong Kong.

It should be noticed that Bangladesh can repeal the PA1911.  Once the PA is repealed, no enterprise will be able to get a product patent in Bangladesh.  This will enable the national pharmaceutical companies to manufacture and export the product up to 2016.    One cannot understand why Bangladesh authorities are not repealing the Patent Act 1911.

Best regards,

Bala
