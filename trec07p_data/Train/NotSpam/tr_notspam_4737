Hello sm1lies,

The final assembly competition for TopCoder's new UML tool is now open for registration.

The UML Tool will be used by TopCoder members to design and develop software.  It will also be used by TopCoder staff to design and review components. 

This assembly competition is for the final, assembled tool.  This assembly competition focuses on the GUI aspect of the tool, as well as the overall functionality it will offer.  The backend data model and a large part of the backend functionality have already been implemented as part of the UML Tool Backend Assembly competition.  This competition will finish the tool using the backend code and components completed specifically for this tool. 

The winning team will share a first-place payment of $18,000, with $9,000 for the second-place team.

This tool will be used heavily by component competitors and needs to be stable, efficient, and user friendly.  Registration ends May 1 -- don't miss your chance! 

Good luck!

- The TopCoder Software Team
