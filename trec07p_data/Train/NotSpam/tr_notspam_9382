I had speakup working once with Ubuntu Feisty but can't get it to work since.
All I can do when I get to a text console is get espeak to say "hello"
with the spd-say hello as when I type the command sudo modprobe
speakup_sftsyn, I get the swound of silence.
I tried uninstalling both speechd-up and speech-dispatcher and
re-installing them but still the same problem.
