8:54 PM, 6/20/07, Update: Mission Management Team clears Atlantis for entry=
=20

NASA's Mission Management Team late today cleared the shuttle Atlantis for =
entry Thursday, weather permitting, after unanimously resolving a few final=
 technical questions.

MMT Chairman John Shannon scheduled an unusual night-before-entry meeting l=
ate today to discuss three last-minute issues:

*** A final imagery assessment to determine, if possible, the nature of deb=
ris seen floating between the shuttle and the space station after undocking=
 on Monday.

*** An aero-thermal assessment to make sure a small bit of unraveled thread=
 that serves as the upper edge of a "gap filler" between an outboard leadin=
g edge panel on the left wing and an adjacent row of heat-shield tiles pose=
s no threat for significantly higher downstream heating during entry.

*** Consideration of a revised analysis of the heat experienced by Atlantis=
' left-side rocket pod during ascent when one corner of an insulation blank=
et peeled back. The blanket was repaired during a spacewalk, but because en=
gineers underestimated how hot the underlying structure got during the clim=
b to space, Shannon ordered a final discussion to make sure no one had any =
concerns.

The evening meeting lasted less than two hours. A NASA spokesman said engin=
eers do, in fact, believe the debris seen after undocking was close to the =
shuttle and, as a result, small and no threat to the orbiter. As for the ro=
cket pod analysis, the MMT concluded the graphite-epoxy material making up =
the left-side Orbital Maneuvering System rocket pod is not in any danger of=
 over heating, thanks in part to the repair job carried out during a spacew=
alk last Friday.

Finally, the MMT concluded the protruding gap filler thread will not cause =
any problems during entry. The spokesman said the decision to proceed with =
entry, weather permitting, was unanimous.
