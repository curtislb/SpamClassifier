You must use the root account for such things. Either type "su -" in a Te=
rminal, or choose directly
Applications/Accessories/Root Terminal in order to get a root terminal. I=
n both cases you will be asked for the root
password (you defined this during the install process - the first of the =
two passwords you defined).

As a note, gdm doesn't allow you to log in as root since is not a good id=
ea to do such a thing (too many risks
involved). By default, you can only log in directly as root in console te=
rminals (ctrl+alt+F1, ctrl+alt+F2 ... up to
ctrl+alt+F6; ctrl+alt+F7 will bring you back to the X session).

Good luck with your wireless card!
