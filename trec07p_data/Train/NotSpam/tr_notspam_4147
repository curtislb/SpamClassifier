[ Picked text/plain from multipart/alternative ]
Two pleasantly dim articles on Indian patent law which provide comic relief.

First, Barun Mitra puts his feeble mind to issues he doesn't quite grasp: http://beta.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?id=6ceefbc4-07c4-4454-a89b-f625ea42a52f and then Roger Bate wags his tail at the subject in: http://www.aei.org/publications/filter.all,pubID.25989/pub_detail.asp

>From which we can only deduce that AEI fellows and their tropical consorts have inferior internet connections but superior mind-reading skills. Never mind that Mashelkar himself has said that his report has nothing to do with sec 3(d) of Indian patent law: http://mail.sarai.net/pipermail/commons-law/2007-February/002358.html
>>>[Mashelkar] says that he's "in total agreement with Section 3(d). The benchmarks that we set depends entirely on us. It is for any individual country to decide the threshold limits and it is through these thresholds that the governments can exercise control."<<<

The upside - for all those "critics" out there, with enemies like this, who needs friends?
