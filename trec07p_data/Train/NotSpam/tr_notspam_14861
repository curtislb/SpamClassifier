THOMPSON TAKES KEY STEPS TOWARD WHITE HOUSE RUN: Former Senator Fred D. Thompson of Tennessee has taken new steps that make it clear that he is likely to run for the White House, potentially shaking up a field of candidates that has failed to strike a chord with the Republican base. Mr. Thompson is creating a committee that will let him begin raising money on Monday toward a full-blown national campaign, advisers said Wednesday. They hope his name recognition as an actor and radio commentator, conservative stands on issues like immigration and government spending, and strength in the South will differentiate him from the current crop of candidates. The disclosure of his intensifying activities sent ripples through the party, with the campaigns of two of the main Republican candidates checking with their deputies in Iowa and New Hampshire to monitor any hiring or fund-raising efforts by Mr. Thompson, 64. New York Times: Stir in GOP as ex-senator move to run
http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/us/politics/31thompson.html

THOMPSON COULD BE FORCED ONTO IOWA STRAW POLL:  Whether he wants to be or not, former Sen. Fred Thompson will probably be on the ballot when thousands of Iowa Republicans meet on Aug. 11 at the Ames straw poll. After months of speculation that the "Law & Order" star would leap into the crowded race for the Republican nomination for president, aides let the cat out of the bag on Wednesday, saying Thompson was likely to declare his intentions in early July. But that does not automatically mean he will participate in the much-hyped event. The Politico: Iowa GOP could force Fred onto straw poll.
http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0507/4252.html

WILL THOMPSON COMPETE IN IOWA? Former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson is expected to take steps toward a Republican presidential campaign, but is unsure to what extent he will compete in Iowa. Thompson, who is expected to form a group this week to allow him to test the waters, has signaled GOP officials in Iowa that he would campaign for the caucuses. "Fred Thompson is taking all the necessary steps to come to his final decision," Thompson spokesman Mark Corallo told The Des Moines Register. "Stay tuned." Des Moines Register: Thompson reaches out to Iowa GOP
http://www.desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070530/-NEWS/70530012/1001

THOMPSON SET TO RUN AGAINST AN OLD FRIEND: He endorsed Sen. John McCain's 2000 insurgent campaign for president, at the time saying the Arizona Republican "has shown characteristics of leadership like nobody I've ever seen." After that election, he was a key GOP ally in the 2002 passage of McCain's signature campaign-finance-reform legislation. But now former Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., has become the latest challenge to McCain's 2008 White House hopes. The Law & Order actor plans to officially enter the Republican presidential race in July, according to news reports. "Fred's a very good friend," McCain said Wednesday in Phoenix. "I guess my words are, 'Come on in, the water's fine.'" Arizona Republic: One-time ally set to compete vs. McCain

BUSH REACHES OUT TO PUTIN: President Bush yesterday launched a high-stakes effort to repair the dramatically deteriorating U.S. relationship with Russia by inviting President Vladimir Putin to visit the family compound in Kennebunkport, Maine, after weeks of rhetoric reminiscent of the Cold War. The White House has grown increasingly alarmed lately with the harsh tone coming out of Moscow and its hardening positions on issues that include Iran's nuclear program, Kosovo statehood and missile defense. Administration officials said privately that the situation has reached a crisis stage and needs to be reversed before it gets worse. Although the president's aides do not expect to resolve the stickiest issues dividing the two sides during the visit to the Bush family retreat on the rocky Maine coast July 1-2, they hope the relaxed setting will restore U.S.-Russian relations to a more constructive footing.

SPOTLIGHT SHINES ON ZOELLICK: Robert B. Zoellick, freshly anointed by President Bush as his choice to lead the World Bank, yesterday spoke in conciliatory tones about healing the rifts left from the tenure of the previous appointee, Paul D. Wolfowitz. "The World Bank has passed through a difficult time for all involved," Zoellick said at a morning announcement at the White House. "There are frustrations, anxieties, and tensions about the past that could inhibit the future. This is understandable but not without remedy. We need to put yesterday's discord behind us and to focus on the future together." Zoellick, a former U.S. trade representative and deputy secretary of state, said he would spend the coming weeks sounding out bank staff, development experts and governments around the world on what the World Bank should focus on, while courting support. Washington Post: Zoellick debuts as Bank nominee

FREEH TO ENDORSE GIULIANI: Louis Freeh, Democrat Bill Clinton's FBI director, is going over to the other side in a big way today -- endorsing Republican presidential hopeful Rudy Giuliani, the Daily News has learned. The high-profile endorsement is a boon to the former mayor, whose views on security and terrorism can only benefit from having an international lawman like Freeh in his corner, experts said. "Any endorsement that lets Rudy talk about fighting crime and terrorism is good for him," said GOP consultant Dan Schnur. "And if Giuliani and [Hillary] Clinton are the nominees, you can be sure that Louis Freeh ends up in the front row of every debate, just to try and knock her off her game."

OBAMA, ROMNEY OFFER SHARP CONTRASTS ON IRAQ: Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and Republican candidate Mitt Romney outline their respective foreign policy visions in lengthy articles in the next issue of Foreign Affairs magazine, offering sharp contrasts on issues including the war in Iraq and climate change. Obama calls the Bush administration's Iraq policies "tragically misguided" and advocates a phased withdrawal of U.S. combat forces, to be completed by next March. Romney notes that there is "no guarantee" that the administration's current strategy will succeed but says that "the stakes are too high and the potential fallout too great to deny our military leaders and troops on the ground the resources and the time needed to give it an opportunity." Washington Post: Obama and Romney lay out positions on Iraq and beyond
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/30/AR2007053002302.html

BROWNBACK ON EVOLUTION: In our sound-bite political culture, it is unrealistic to expect that every complicated issue will be addressed with the nuance or subtlety it deserves. So I suppose I should not have been surprised earlier this month when, during the first Republican presidential debate, the candidates on stage were asked to raise their hands if they did not "believe" in evolution. As one of those who raised his hand, I think it would be helpful to discuss the issue in a bit more detail and with the seriousness it demands.  The premise behind the question seems to be that if one does not unhesitatingly assert belief in evolution, then one must necessarily believe that God created the world and everything in it in six 24-hour days. But limiting this question to a stark choice between evolution and creationism does a disservice to the complexity of the interaction between science, faith and reason.

DEMS CAUSING MORE EXCITEMENT IN THE GRANITE STATE: Democratic presidential candidates are drawing bigger crowds, more donors, and more energy from the New Hampshire electorate than Republican hopefuls are, a sign to officials in both parties of a lack of enthusiasm for the current GOP field and a tired state Republican Party still reeling from a historic defeat in November. New Hampshire Republicans, who lost control of both chambers of the state Legislature and both US House seats last fall, are showing only moderate interest in the 10 GOP presidential candidates who have trooped to their state. Democratic candidates for the 2008 nomination, meanwhile, have had to issue tickets to campaign events to accommodate large crowds, and are already conducting statewide canvassing efforts usually unheard of at this early stage of the campaign. Average donations to Democratic contenders from New Hampshire residents are also higher and more numerous, according to campaign finance reco!

GIULIANI SLAMS CLINTON'S PROPOSED 'STAGGERING TAX INCREASE': Mayor Giuliani is labeling Senator Clinton's plan to reverse President Bush's tax cuts "an astounding, staggering tax increase" that would turn back the clock and damage America's economy. In a potential preview of next fall's presidential contest, Mr. Giuliani, who is seen as the front-runner for the Republican nomination, directly attacked the leading Democratic candidate, Mrs. Clinton, over a speech she gave Tuesday in New Hampshire bemoaning the return of "robber barons" and promising to pursue "shared prosperity" by increasing taxes on Americans making more than $200,000 a year.

CLINTON: JET TRAVEL COMPLIED WITH SENATE RULES: Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton said Wednesday that she followed all Senate rules when she accepted rides on a private jet from a longtime benefactor. "Whatever I've done, I complied with Senate rules at the time. That's the way every senator operates," the Democratic presidential contender said in an interview with The Associated Press during a campaign stop in Las Vegas. Clinton's travel, along with and consulting fees paid to her husband, the former president, have come to light recently in a lawsuit against Vinod Gupta, a Clinton contributor and chief executive of the data company, InfoUSA Inc.

AL NOT THE ONLY GORE MAKING MONEY: Looks like former Vice President Al Gore -- and the will he? Won't he? run for president game -- isn't the only Gore family member generating excitement these days. His wife, Tipper, is creating quite a buzz herself on 14th Street. The Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams furniture store, which opened in late April, sells prints of some of Tipper's photography. (She's been shooting since the 1970s and even put out a book of photographs in 1996 titled, "Picture This.") Turns out, they've already sold four, including "Pyramids in Egypt" and "Shanghai Scene." And that's no small feat, considering that it'll run you anywhere from $750 to $2,950 to walk out of the store with a Tipper photo under your arm. DC Examiner: Yeas and Nays

<br><br>OBAMA, ROMNEY OFFER SHARP CONTRASTS ON IRAQ:
Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and Republican
candidate Mitt Romney outline their respective foreign policy
visions in lengthy articles in the next issue of Foreign
Affairs magazine, offering sharp contrasts on issues including
the war in Iraq and climate change. Obama calls the Bush
administration's Iraq policies "tragically misguided" and
advocates a phased withdrawal of U.S. combat forces, to be
completed by next March. Romney notes that there is "no
guarantee" that the administration's current strategy will
succeed but says that "the stakes are too high and the
potential fallout too great to deny our military leaders and
troops on the ground the resources and the time needed to give
it an opportunity." Washington Post: Obama and Romney lay out
positions on Iraq and beyond

EVOLUTION: In our sound-bite political culture, it is
unrealistic to expect that every complicated issue will be
addressed with the nuance or subtlety it deserves. So I suppose
I should not have been surprised earlier this month when,
during the first Republican presidential debate, the candidates
on stage were asked to raise their hands if they did not
"believe" in evolution. As one of those who raised his hand, I
think it would be helpful to discuss the issue in a bit more
detail and with the seriousness it demands.  The premise behind
the question seems to be that if one does not unhesitatingly
assert belief in evolution, then one must necessarily believe
that God created the world and everything in it in six 24-hour
days. But limiting this question to a stark choice between
evolution and creationism does a disservice to the complexity
of the interaction between science, faith and reason. New York

STATE: Democratic presidential candidates are drawing bigger
crowds, more donors, and more energy from the New Hampshire
electorate than Republican hopefuls are, a sign to officials in
both parties of a lack of enthusiasm for the current GOP field
and a tired state Republican Party still reeling from a
historic defeat in November. New Hampshire Republicans, who
lost control of both chambers of the state Legislature and both
US House seats last fall, are showing only moderate interest in
the 10 GOP presidential candidates who have trooped to their
state. Democratic candidates for the 2008 nomination,
meanwhile, have had to issue tickets to campaign events to
accommodate large crowds, and are already conducting statewide
canvassing efforts usually unheard of at this early stage of
the campaign. Average donations to Democratic contenders from
New Hampshire residents are also higher and more numerous,
according to campaign finance records. Boston Globe: Democrats

CLINTON'S PROPOSED 'STAGGERING TAX INCREASE': Mayor Giuliani is
labeling Senator Clinton's plan to reverse President Bush's tax
cuts "an astounding, staggering tax increase" that would turn
back the clock and damage America's economy. In a potential
preview of next fall's presidential contest, Mr. Giuliani, who
is seen as the front-runner for the Republican nomination,
directly attacked the leading Democratic candidate, Mrs.
Clinton, over a speech she gave Tuesday in New Hampshire
bemoaning the return of "robber barons" and promising to pursue
"shared prosperity" by increasing taxes on Americans making
more than $200,000 a year. New York Sun: Giuliani lashes into

<br>CLINTON: JET TRAVEL COMPLIED WITH SENATE RULES: Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton said Wednesday that she followed all
Senate rules when she accepted rides on a private jet from a
longtime benefactor. "Whatever I've done, I complied with
Senate rules at the time. That's the way every senator
operates," the Democratic presidential contender said in an
interview with The Associated Press during a campaign stop in
Las Vegas. Clinton's travel, along with and consulting fees
paid to her husband, the former president, have come to light
recently in a lawsuit against Vinod Gupta, a Clinton
contributor and chief executive of the data company, InfoUSA
Inc. AP via Yahoo News: Sen. Clinton defends private jet travel

like former Vice President Al Gore -- and the will he? Won't
he? run for president game -- isn't the only Gore family member
generating excitement these days. His wife, Tipper, is creating
quite a buzz herself on 14th Street. The Mitchell Gold + Bob
Williams furniture store, which opened in late April, sells
prints of some of Tipper's photography. (She's been shooting
since the 1970s and even put out a book of photographs in 1996
titled, "Picture This.") Turns out, they've already sold four,
including "Pyramids in Egypt" and "Shanghai Scene." And that's
no small feat, considering that it'll run you anywhere from
$750 to $2,950 to walk out of the store with a Tipper photo
under your arm. DC Examiner: Yeas and Nays
