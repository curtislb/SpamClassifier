Anyone give me any ideas on how to do this.  Normally the the ipw2200 
file is extracted and the ipw2200-1.1.0 is made and installed.  Then the 
ipw2200 fw 3.0 is unzipped and the four files are placed in 
the/lib/firmware folder.
Etch won't let me move files in the firmware folder, says I don't have 
permission.  If I choose change user from the "Desktop" menu, it won't 
let me log in as root.  I'm at a loss as to how to make this happen.
Jim
