<br>

<br>
<b>Medical Morale</b>
<br>

<br>
Why is it that doctors are paid more than ever and work fewer hours but acc=
ording to James Johnson, who's just been forced to resign as boss of the BM=
A, morale has never been lower?=20
<br>

<br>
We'll try and answer that question - and work out whether it matters if doc=
tors are unhappy as long as the NHS is in rude health. Please do join the d=
ebate which has already <b><a href=3D"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/newsnight/=
2007/05/medical_morale.html">begun here</b></a>.
<br>

<br>
<b><a href=3D"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6677193.stm">One patient =
gives his views and experiences here</b></a>
<br>

<br>
<b>Lebanon Clashes</b>
<br>

<br>
There's been a second day of bloody  fighting in Lebanon as the army shell =
a Palestinian refugee camp in the North of the country.=20
<br>

<br>
Our diplomatic editor Mark Urban will explain just why the clash is so impo=
rtant to the future of the Lebanese government and to the wider conflict ac=
ross the Middle East.
<br>

<br>
<b>Racism in Psychiatry?</b>
<br>

<br>
Black British men are up to eighteen times more likely to be diagnosed with=
 mental health problems than white men. Is this institutional racism?=20
<br>

<br>
Not according to the latest evidence from the Institute of Psychiatry. They=
 argue that calling it racism is getting in the way of treating black patie=
nts, we explain.
<br>

<br>
<b>Cutty Sark and the Stars</b>
<br>

<br>
"We will put her back together" - the words of Dr Eric Kentley, curatorial =
consultant to the Cutty Sark Trust, after he'd seen the damage from this mo=
rning's fire.=20
<br>

<br>
Tonight we'll ask why we hold the Cutty Sark in such high regard. And Our S=
cience Editor Susan Watts has an exclusive preview of the latest exhibit at=
 the maritime museum - can the new planetarium rebuild Britain's interest i=
n the stars?
<br>

<br>
Do join us at 10.30pm.
<br>

<br>
