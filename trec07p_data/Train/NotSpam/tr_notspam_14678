03:10 PM, 5/30/07, Update: Spacewalk begins

Expedition 15 commander Fyodor Yurchikhin and Oleg Kotov, floating in the P=
irs airlock module, opened an outer hatch today at 3:05 p.m. to officially =
kick off a spacewalk to install micrometeoroid shielding on the Zvezda comm=
and module. The spacewalk got started about 45 miniutes late because of min=
or communications problems.

This is the 82nd spacewalk devoted to station assembly since construction b=
egan in 1998, the fifth of 2007 and the first for the Expedition 15 crew. G=
oing into today's EVA, 65 shuttle/station fliers representing seven partner=
 nations had logged 498 hours and 3 minutes of spacewalk time building and =
maintaining the space station. It is the first spacewalk for Yurchikhin and=
 Kotov, the 66th and 67th crew members to float outside.

For identification, Yurchikhin's call sign is EV-1 and his suit features re=
d stripes. Kotov, wearing a suit with blue stripes, is EV-2. Astronaut Suni=
ta Williams , a veteran of four spacewalks, will monitor today's excursion =
from inside the station.

"How is everything outside, guys, is everything fine?" a Russian flight con=
troller radioed as the Russians began setting up their tools and equipment.

"It's kind of cloudy," one of the spacewalkers joked. "It's going to be rai=
ning probably. We didn't take an umbrella with us."

The goal of Russian EVA-18 is to install micrometeoroid debris panels on th=
e forward section of the Zvezda command module. Six panels were installed i=
n 2002 and Yurchikhin and Kotov plan to attach another five today. The pane=
ls measure about two feet by three feet, are about one inch thick and weigh=
 between 15 and 20 pounds each. Twelve more panels will be installed during=
 a spacewalk next Wednesday.

"These panels are to provide additional debris protection on the service mo=
dule," said flight director Bob Dempsey. "Some have already been installed =
on a previous spacewalk and we're going to complete this task on the next t=
wo spacewalks. This will provide additional debris protection on that (part=
) of the service module in the unlikely event some micrometeoroid debris sh=
ould impact it."

The debris panels are mounted in three bundles on a pressurized mating adap=
ter bolted to the Unity module's left-portal. Yurchikhin and Kotov will use=
 a telescoping Russian boom to move the panels from Unity to the forward se=
ction of the Zvezda module. The cosmonauts also plan to work at the back of=
 the command module to re-route a cable leading to a Global Positioning Sys=
tem antenna that eventually will provide navigation data to unmanned Europe=
an Space Agency cargo ships.

At the Kennedy Space Center today, NASA managers kicked off a two-day fligh=
t readiness review to assess the status of work to prepare the shuttle Atla=
ntis for blastoff June 8. A news conference to discuss the results and to a=
nnounce an official launch date is planned for Thursday afternoon.

If all goes well, Atlantis' countdown will begin at 9 p.m. Tuesday, the sta=
tion astronauts will conduct Russian EVA-19 the following day and two days =
after that, Atlantis will finally take off on a critical mission to deliver=
 a new set of solar arrays. Launch originally was planned for March 15, but=
 the flight was delayed by work to repair hail damage to the insulation on =
the ship's external fuel tank.
