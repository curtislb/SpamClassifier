I just edit the sources.list, and replace stable with testing, run apt-get
update, and then apt-get dist-upgrade, and it should work, just watch for
what it removes.
Thanks,

Subject: Upgrading Debian to Testing with speakup


> Hiya,
>     I was wondering how to upgrade Debian Etch 4.0R0 to Testing with
Speakup?  I've got the NetInst stuff from people.debian.org/~shane, but
don't know if kernel 2.6.18 is the latest version in Testing.  I'm not sure
if I want to run a mixed distribution: is this common with Debian?
>     I know that none of the official Deb kernels contain Speakup.  Would I
need to roll my own if I wanted to upgrade to Testing?
> Thanks,
> Zack.
