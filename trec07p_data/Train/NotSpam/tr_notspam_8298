IIRC, you may get rid of these warnings with at least two different solutions:

(1) cheat, and tell Perl not to warn on things it "thinks" to have
been used only once

     no warnings "once";  # would be enough

Because the warnings are just that: the Perl interpreter thinks OLDERR
and OLDOUT were used just once, because they show up in the open
statements and again when you restore the STDOUT and STDERR.

> open(STDOUT, ">&OLDOUT");
> open(STDERR, ">&OLDERR");

But in these, they are part of a string and the interpreter could not
detect by syntactical means that they will be used again.

(2) As you're duping, I think you may close the handles explicitly
after the restoration of STDOUT and STDERR.

close OLDOUT;
close OLDERR;

In this case, Perl would see a second use of these handles and will
not complain.

Adriano Ferreira.
