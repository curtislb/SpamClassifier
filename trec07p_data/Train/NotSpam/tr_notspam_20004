12:26 PM, 6/17/07, Update: Spacewalk begins=20

Floating in the Quest airlock module, astronauts Steve Swanson and Pat Forr=
ester switched their spacesuits to internal battery power at 12:25 p.m. to =
officially begin a six-and-a-half-hour spacewalk, the fourth and final plan=
ned excursion for the Atlantis astronauts.

This is the 87th spacewalk devoted to space station assembly and maintenanc=
e since construction began in 1998 and the 10th so far this year. Going int=
o today's EVA, 48 U.S. astronauts, 15 Russian cosmonauts, two Canadians and=
 four astronauts representing Japan, Germany, France and Sweden had logged =
530 hours and 34 minutes of EVA time building and maintaining the space sta=
tion. The three previous shuttle EVAs by Forrester, Swanson, Jim Reilly and=
 Danny Olivas total 21 hours and 29 minutes.

The primary goal of today's spacewalk is to finish activating a solar array=
 rotary joint on the newly installed S3 truss to permit the outboard right-=
side S4 arrays to track the sun. The astronauts also plan to carry out a va=
riety of other station assembly tasks. See the 8:39 a.m. status report for =
complete details.
