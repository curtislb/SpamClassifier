TONIGHT ON SHOWBIZ TONIGHT- CNN HEADLINE PRIME 11pm ET/11pm PT

DON IMUS RACIAL CONTROVERSY EXPLODES!
Imus loses his MSNBC TV show, but tonight, Showbiz Tonight asks
the controversial question:
Did the punishment fit the crime? The revealing inside story on
the Imus mess and why the shock jock could be getting another
giant pink slip.

ANNA NICOLE SMITH: PLAYBOY MAGAZINE TRIBUTE
One-on-one with Playboy’s Editorial Director for a special look
at the pictures that launched Anna Nicole’s career and helped
to create her legacy. Also, the secret story of the debate that
raged at Playboy over whether to put her in the magazine in the
first place - because she was too heavy! How that monumental
decision influenced the body image of women everywhere, and
gave others the inspiration to pursue their dreams.

THE MOST EXPENSIVE CELEBRITY DIVORCES EVER!
Harrison Ford, $85 million. Steven Spielberg, $100 million. But
hold on, that's chump change. Tonight, the stars who had to pay
even more than that. Showbiz Tonight with the divorce dollars,
Hollywood Style!

PAULINA PORIZKOVA'S SHOCKING STORIES ABOUT THE MODELING
INDUSTRY
The former supermodel (um, she was also the first booted off
this season's "Dancing With the Stars") opens up about the
startling things that happened on and off the runway -- we're
talking disturbing stories about sex, drugs and much more.
Plus, her no-holds-barred thoughts on today's super-skinny
model controversy.
