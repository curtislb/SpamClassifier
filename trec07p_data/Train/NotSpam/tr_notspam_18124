Devuelve M?xico a Guatemala pintura del siglo XVII robada  
EFE 
El Universal 
Ciudad de M?xico 
Jueves 07 de junio de 2007 

 
El sue?o del Papa Gregorio IX fue extra?da en mayo de 2004 en un Museo de La
Antigua; la pieza fue dividida en dos partes y los ladrones pensaban
venderla en el mercado negro del arte 

 
Las autoridades mexicanas devolvieron hoy a las de Guatemala una pintura del
siglo XVII que hab?a sido robada del Museo de Arte Colonial de La Antigua
Guatemala, el 2 de mayo de 2004. 
La obra El sue?o del Papa Gregorio IX, valorada en casi tres millones de
pesos (unos 272 mil d?lares) , fue entregada por el procurador general de la
Rep?blica de M?xico, Eduardo Medina Mora, a su hom?logo guatemalteco, Juan
Luis Florido Sol?s, en la capital mexicana. 

El ?leo, que fue dividido en dos piezas por los ladrones, fue pintado por el
mexicano Crist?bal de Villalpando (1645-1714) y mide 3.38 metros de alto por
2.33 de ancho. 

En ?l aparecen un personaje recostado en una cama con dosel y frente a ?l
est? San Francisco de As?s sobre una nube. 

Una parte de la pieza fue recuperada por agentes de la Fiscal?a federal
mexicana el 16 de enero de 2006, y el resto, el 16 de febrero de ese a?o en
el poblado de Ajij?, en el municipio de Chapala, estado de Jalisco, oeste de
M?xico. 

Por este robo le fue impuesta una pena de tres a?os de prisi?n y una
indemnizaci?n de un mill?n de pesos (90 mil 900 d?lares) por da?os a
Francisco Guti?rrez Casta?eda, quien ten?a en su poder una de las partes de
la obra. 

Al parecer este sujeto pretend?a revender la obra en el mercado negro del
arte. 

Medina Mora dijo que la obra era "una pintura de un valor extraordinario" y
a?adi? que la devoluci?n "honra la buena relaci?n que M?xico tiene con la
hermana Rep?blica de Guatemala" , y ratifica el compromiso de M?xico con los
tratados internacionales contra el tr?fico ilegal de obras de arte. 

Por su parte, el fiscal de Guatemala, al agradecer el apoyo de M?xico en el
caso, agradeci? la solidaridad de M?xico y a?adi? que la entrega era un
hecho "no s?lo hist?rico, sino tambi?n un ?xito de investigaci?n" de las
autoridades mexicanas. 

"Me deleita ver ese cuadro, que tantas veces vi en Antigua, en el museo, y
para nosotros es regocijo volverlo a ver y saber que va de regreso con la
colaboraci?n de las autoridades mexicanas" , dijo, por su parte, el
embajador de Guatemala en M?xico, Manuel Arturo Soto Aguirre. 


El diplom?tico centroamericano consider? la entrega un "acto extraordinario
de cooperaci?n".

In an astonishing article in a recent issue of the Austrian weekly, FALTER
(NR.22/07, P.6) of 1st June 2007, entitled "T?cke des Objekts", the Director
of the Museum fur V?lkerkunde, Wien rejects once more any claim for the
return of the stolen Benin art works which are in his museum.

In this article, the Professor refers to the interest in the question of
restitution of stolen art objects which has been generated by the current
exhibition on Benin in the Museum f?r V?lkerkunde, Benin-Kings and Rituals:
Court Arts from Nigeria. The professor declares that a straight forward
exposition of a single case for example, Benin bronzes, does not help the
understanding of a specific case nor the general issue.

    The author refers to the colonial and imperialist expansion overseas and
the resulting presence of several artworks in the museums of Western Europe.
He cites the example of the "Montezuma's Crown" which is the State symbol of
Mexico. Mexico has been claiming the return from Austria of this crown for
years without success. The professor states that the loudest claim comes
from a single person who has no legitimate basis and has been playing with
the sense of justice of the Indians and the love of the Viennese for the
Indians! ("die Indianerliebe der Wiener") The demand was, according to the
professor, made by communist emigrants who had returned to Mexico and was
also supported by the SPO and the Greens.

    The author adds that most of the stolen Benin objects, including those
in Vienna were the result of the British punitive expedition of 1897 and
mentions the killing of the British delegation. The professor does not
explain what the British delegation was doing there. He does not explain
that the Oba of Benin had told the British that he was not ready to receive
them and that the time they proposed to visit Benin was not appropriate
since it was a period in which certain traditional rites were to be
performed and therefore not advisable for foreigners to visit his country. 

    The professor then refers to the restoration of Nazi stolen goods and
says that it was the atrocity of the Nazi regime which led to an attempt at
restitution "Die Monstrosit?t der Nazi-Verbrechen hat zum Versuch einer
Wiedergutmachung gef?hrt".He then asks whether one is going to correct all
injustices of the past: "Can one restore America to the Indians? ("Kann man
Amerika den Indianern zur?ckgeben?) Is slavery reversible? (Ist die
Sklaverei reversibel?") The professor ends his exposition with a declaration
that we could as well request compensation for the oldest stealing in
history "Wiedergutmachung des ?ltesten Diebstahls der (biblischen)
Geschichte".

    This article by the Director of the V?lkerkunde Museum is remarkable in
many aspects.

 Contrary to the position of the infamous Declaration on Universal Museums
that each claim of restitution should be examined on its own merit, the
professor states that it would be unhelpful to examine each case on its own.
So you should not examine Benin's demand in isolation but in a context where
you deal with Montezuma's Crown, the return of America to the Native
Americans, compensation for the Nazi stolen goods and the original crime or
sin by Adam and Eve. So instead of clear claims, you deal with an incredible
amalgam of issues of entirely different qualities and dimensions. Is it
legitimate to compare a precise historical fact of modern times, the looting
and invasion of Benin by the British in 1897 with a mythological fact of
trillions of years, or even before reckoning of time started, the creation
of the universe and the world? Must we really deal with Adam and Eve when we
ask for the return of the Benin artworks from Vienna?

With this method, you can kill all demands. Do we dare compare the stealing
of the Benin bronzes with the alleged crime of Eve in eating an apple and
giving some to Adam? (Is gender discrimination at work here? Incidentally,
in the version of the myth of Adam and Eve that I know, it was the snake who
gave Eve the apple and thus the primary culprit. Moreover, the myth is, as
far as I know, usually used to explain the idea of original sin from which
we, the sons and daughters of the original sinful couple cannot escape as
much as we try. Our lustful/curious progenitors had partaken of the tree of
knowledge and as consequence were expelled from Paradise. I have never seen
it used to illustrate theft as opposed to sin). Is there not an obligation
for intellectuals to clarify issues rather than confuse them? Does any one
understand better the issue of the return of the Benin art works after he or
she has been taken to the dizzy spheres of creation and the cosmos? What is
amazing is the total absence of balance and a sense of proportion in making
such comparisons?

    Should intellectuals not understand and take into account the feelings
of victims of aggression? Is it allowed that a Viennese ethnologist totally
ignores the feelings and trauma of victims of aggression and thereby throws
overboard the lessons of Sigmund Freud and the Viennese psychologists and
psychoanalysts? How can the professor declare that the attempt to restore
and compensate for property seized by the Nazis was due to the atrocities of
the Fascists? Is he saying that without the atrocities there would have been
no call or need for compensation for the property they seized? Is he telling
the people of Benin that they should not place any hope in this example of
restitution because there had been no atrocities in their case? Was the
British invasion not an atrocity enough? The professor knows that the
question of legality and legitimacy is not in anyway affected by the fact
that the illegal dispossession of a person of his property was or was not
accompanied by atrocities. Would the professor care to repeat his statement
on the Nazi dispossession to victims or successors to victims of these
illegalities? 

    During the International Symposium at the Hofburg, 9-10 May 2007, I
strongly advised the professor that certain arguments should not be made in
the presence or to the hearing of the victims of injustice. Apparently, this
advice fell on deaf ears. The author declares in his article that in most
societies it was not usual to keep old objects which were no longer used
whilst in the Western museums and private collections these objects were
attributed a value as documentation of foreign culture and as evidence of
non-European culture. The implication here is that no values were attached
to these objects before the Europeans started collecting them. This
corresponds to the idea propounded in the catalogue of the Benin Exhibition
and elsewhere that by being kept in the Western museums these objects have
gained additional value as aesthetic objects. Such a statement is astounding
when addressed to owners who are claiming the return of their property by
those illegally keeping them. Besides, this statement is not true as far as
Benin is concerned. Some of these art objects are documentary evidence of
the history of Benin and as the Benin Royals stated during the International
Symposium they are needed as records of their history.

Did anybody, anywhere ever ask for slavery to be reversed? Why does the
professor throw in this unfounded demand? To create more confusion? What has
slavery to do with the restitution of specific art objects in the museums
and elsewhere? If he wants to talk about demands for restitution, why does
he not state clearly the case for compensation for slavery and the demand
for final removal of the vestiges of slavery and the arguments against such
demands? Should intellectuals not contribute to enlightenment even if they
do not share certain views?

    The demand for the return of the stolen or looted art works will
continue for a long time and will not go away. The nature of these works
makes it impossible to ignore this question. You can place a Benin bronze
anywhere you like and the question will always arise. Where did it come from
and what is it for? Ironically, the argument for defending the anachronistic
distinction between art from African countries, which is kept in Museums of
Ethnology and European art which is kept in Art museums and galleries, is
what makes the question of the origin a permanent feature of such
collections.

Ethnologists and others have always argued that you cannot appreciate
African artworks as purely aesthetic objects, concentrating on the
craftsmanship and the elegance of the objects. That they are best understood
in their religious and social context. It is this need to know the functions
and significance of these objects that will keep alive the question of
origin.

    There is in the article a certain imprecision which leads to confusion,
insinuations and misleading impressions. When the professor states that
UNESCO recommendations were not observed, he does not mention that they were
not observed by those Western countries holding illegally these art works
and creates the impression that the International community does not pay
much attention to UNESCO's efforts.

    It seems to me that the author speaks with two tongues. At the opening
of the Benin Exhibition and at the International Symposium that followed, he
spoke about the need for dialogue and co-operation. In this article in
FALTER, this emphasis disappears and a clear line of refusal is discernible.
The people of Benin will no doubt take note of this.

    What is required in the question of restitution is a certain minimum
sense of justice on the part of those in illegal possession of these art
objects and a willingness to arrive at a reasonable solution which will
enable the victims of imperialist aggression to continue with their history
and traditions whilst permitting those fascinated by their culture to admire
and study these works. The selfishness and obstinacy of the Western holders
of these objects surpass all reasonable limits.

All eyes on Lake Okeechobee artifacts
Native American artifacts discovered when Lake Okeechobee's waters receded
are now under constant guard from looters.
BY KELLY WOLFE
The Palm Beach Post

BELLE GLADE -- Officer David Burnsed is alone out here except for all the
gators.

And it's his job to keep it that way.

He's an officer with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission,
posted at the mucky gateway to 2,000 years of Florida history. He uses an
airboat to pull over boats that get too close to the relics.

''The majority of people know the law and understand we have to do what we
have to do,'' Burnsed said.

He said he's caught a few people poking around the archaeological site. One
person said he wasn't there for artifacts -- but for old Coke bottles.

''Riiiiigggghhhhht,'' Burnsed said.

Burnsed is one of about a half-dozen officers patrolling an area in Lake
Okeechobee where newly discovered Native American artifacts are located.
There's already evidence of looting at the site, which is accessible only by
airboat -- or a long, hot hike through thigh-high muck.

''The people who engage in looting and trafficking are not art lovers,''
said Clifford Brown, an archaeology professor at Florida Atlantic
University. ``They're crooks. And they traffic in anything they can make
money on.''

And old stuff does make money.

A casual look at the online auction house eBay shows arrowheads on sale for
$2.99 to $200. Brown said ceramics can fetch tens of thousands of dollars
and Maya carvings can sell for hundreds of thousands.

The auction house Sotheby's set a new world record for antiquities Thursday
when a bronze figure from 1 A.D., Artemis and the Stag, sold for $28.6
million. A spokeswoman at the auction house said there's a rigorous process
to ensure items sold there are not stolen.

But not everyone is as diligent.

''It's where museums get their stuff as well as collectors,'' Brown said.

FAMOUS FIND

Perhaps the most famous case of looting involves the Elgin Marbles, taken
from the Parthenon by the British diplomat Lord Elgin around 1810. They are
housed in the British Museum in London. Greece wants them back.

But England has argued they are better preserved in the museum.

Brown said stolen antiquities are tricky to police.

For example, he said, if people are selling arrowheads dug from their back
yards on eBay, it's OK. It's only when relics are taken from federal land
that it becomes a crime.

That's the case with the Lake Okeechobee site, said the state archaeologist.

Just disturbing the area is a first-degree misdemeanor punishable by up to a
year in jail. Digging at an archaeological site is a felony and carries a
penalty of up to five years in prison.

Local man Boots Boyer stumbled on the Lake Okeechobee site in March, when
water levels dipped below normal. He called county archaeologist Christian
Davenport.

Some of the artifacts discovered include a Native American shell hammer,
some chips of Native American pottery, a broken piece of amethyst glass
(most likely a candleholder), bottles dating back to the early 1900s and
shell pendants that could date back 2,000 years.

Davenport also found a piece of a large ship with copper nails; a 1928
catfish fishing boat; a large, one-cylinder gas engine; and a steam-powered
dredge.

The ship dates back to about 1900 and is splintered across a mile and a
half, Davenport said.

There are also some bones belonging to Native Americans -- but their
presence was previously recorded. They last surfaced after the 2001 drought.

Boyer said he is also pitching in, patrolling the site on his own time.

`RESPECT THE SITE'

''I have a lot of respect for the site,'' Boyer said. ``I ask other people
to please respect the site. It's our history.''

He hopes one day the artifacts will be on display in a historical museum in
Belle Glade.

''It's an awesome find,'' he said.

But even then, the objects may not be safe.

One of the largest antiquities thefts in the southern United States happened
at the Erskine Ramsay Archaeological Repository in Alabama in 1980.

More than 70 percent of the museum's Indian artifact exhibit was stolen --
264 items -- and never recovered.

'Mummy: The Inside Story' 
Exhibit from British Museum reveals Egypt's secrets, but courts controversy 
 
Sianturi Dinah Roma (DinahRS)      
 
I first read about the Rosetta Stone in Edward Said's groundbreaking
Orientalism (1978), in which he mentions how Napoleon Bonaparte's 1798
campaign in Egypt led to the stone's "discovery" the following year by the
young engineer Pierre-Francois Bouchard. As soon as the event was announced,
it sparked the interest of hundreds of archaeologists, collectors and
investigators into Egypt's ancient civilization. 

Among the scholars who had tried decoding the hieroglyphs on the Rosetta
Stone, the most significant achievement is credited to Jean-Francois
Champollion. However, an article in the weekly Al-Ahram in November 2005
offers a contrary opinion. The article quotes London-based Egyptian
Egyptologist Okasha El-Dali as claiming that Arab scholars in fact decoded
the hieroglyphs 1,000 years earlier than Champollion.

It is interesting that the discovery of the Rosetta Stone is only one of the
many layers of mysteries surrounding the exploration of ancient Egypt
itself. But how the stone ended up in the collection of the British Museum
as its valued centerpiece since 1802 is another story that highlights the
power struggles among European countries over the creation and possession of
knowledge. 

The British Museum's "Mummy: The Inside Story" has given me an insight into
the long and often controversial history that shrouds the collection. As a
popular exhibit, it has attracted thousands of visitors in its run in the
U.K. and U.S. It finally made its first visit in Asia at The National
Science Museum of Tokyo (Oct. 7, 2006 to Feb. 2, 2007) and is now drawing to
a close at the Kobe City Museum (March 3 to June 17). In Kobe alone, the
exhibit has already attracted more than 10,000 viewers.

Thematically, the 125 artifacts are divided into five sections:
"Introduction to the World of Ancient Egypt", "Serving the Gods",
"Nesperennub the Priest", "Desire for Rebirth and Eternal Life" and
"Departure to the Afterlife." The Rosetta Stone leads the entire collection.


It is overwhelming to walk through the rows of glass casings, inside of
which sit many gold and bronze statuettes of gods and goddesses, chalices,
jars, miniature shrines, intricately hand-designed gold jewelries, pendants
and amulets. An inner area in the exhibit is devoted to the artifacts of
Nesperrennub the Priest while a reconstructed head of his is displayed
opposite the glass casing that contains a body-length diagram of where the
tabs and pendants were placed throughout the priest's body during his
mummification nearly 3,000 years ago. 

Nesperrennub, who has resided in the British Museum since 1899, also takes
the limelight in a 20-minute 3D film projected onto a 12 foot tall and 42
foot wide curved screen that travels with the exhibit. The film boasts of
the Silicon Graphics Inc.'s (SGI) scanning technology that has distinguished
"The Inside Story" from ordinary exhibits. A project that was conducted over
a two-year period, the mummy was initially scanned at a London hospital and
a follow up scan was done in Scotland using a 3D laser. The film uses high
visualization technology that puts together 1,500 computed tomography (CT)
non-invasive scans of the priest's wrappings and casings into a single data
set. The fly-through effect was an impressive virtual reconstruction of the
priest's face, his life, his environment in Karknak, Egypt and the very
culture he was thought to have lived in. 

What the film is able to reveal as well, without the need to "invade" the
priest's remains, is the tedious mummification process that attests to
ancient Egypt's sophisticated method of preserving the human body. Yet as
all humans are bound to make mistakes, the film through the help of forensic
experts makes guesses on what the embalmers neglected during the process. A
small plate attached to Nesperrennub's skull, for example, is assumed to
have been left there after the clay had hardened.

I left the exhibit thrilled at the discovery of technology in making the
past so alive for the individual nowadays. I have never thought that the
wonders of antiquity can be stored in bits and images and played over and
over again just like another song. Never before has it been so accessible.

Yet another great significance of the exhibit centers on the issue of the
artifacts' possession itself. As I searched for relevant articles on the
issue, a close friend told me to look up the name Dr. Zahi Hawass, Egypt's
Secretary General of the Surpreme Council of Antiquities, who is now a
staunch advocate for the return and protection of the country's "lost
treasures," particularly the Rosetta Stone.

Dr. Hawass's oft-quoted statement that aggressively asks the British to
return the Rosetta Stone "if they want to restore their reputation" was
dismissed by Vivian Davies, keeper of Egypt and Sudanese Antiquities of the
British Museum, by saying that the Rosetta Stone is an important part of
their mission to showcase not only Egyptian antiquity, but its being part of
the world's civilization.
