Okay, I can see that that's a practical issue for Debian, since you want
everything to be buildable from the source dist on a free tool chain.

While it would make sense, I notice that there does not seem to be a
DFSG guideline stating this requirement. Is there a "free tool chain"
requirement for Debian?

Even if there is, though, that's NOT the same as a GPL conflict (which
doesn't occur here unless there's a problem with the license on the
soundfonts).

This is incorrect. There are many examples of GPL software compiled with
non-free compilers, and it is perfectly legal to do so. The "scripts"
you refer to do not include the compiler itself (what is intended by the
text you quote are things like makefiles).

The FSF's claim is that the tool used to create a work is not covered by
the copyleft on the work, nor does the copyleft of the tool affect the
work. Thus, you may compile free software on a non-free compiler or you
may create non-free software using a free compiler without invoking
copyleft requirements.

A useful analogy is word processing -- wouldn't you be very, very
surprised if the GPL on a word processor forced you to use the GPL on
every document you create with it (this would fail DFSG as a "use
restriction", BTW, if it were true)? Likewise, wouldn't you be pretty
surprised if you couldn't release a .doc file created in MS Word under
the GPL if you wrote it yourself?

Also, if the compiler were considered part of the "source" for programs
compiled with it, you'd have to include the entire gcc package with
every C program intended to be compiled with it, which would also be
pretty surprising.

In any case, this is made clear by the GPL FAQ.
See http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl-faq.html:

All of these pretty firmly establish that the license on the output of
the sequencer that renders the MIDI is *not* affected by the license of
the sequencer, regardless of copyleft.

However, input material incorporated into the end result (i.e.
soundfonts) does affect it.

Actually, if the soundfonts are bundled with the sequencer, the last FAQ
may apply. This is the "system library" exception -- perhaps interpreted
a little broadly. If so, then even non-free soundfonts would be
accepted. (Personally, I wouldn't want to rely on this, though).

Cheers,
Terry
