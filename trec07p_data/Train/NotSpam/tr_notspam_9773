I was going to try to give a counterexample from Debian, but apparently out
of 92 installations of python-samba reported via our popcon tool, no one is
actually using the package. :)

I've cc:ed the Debian developers who originally requested that we ship these
bindings; perhaps one of them still has a use for those bindings and would
be willing to maintain them upstream.  If not, I have no objections to
dropping them, though it would be helpful to us if dropping them was done
post-3.0.25.

Cheers,
