South Korea, US may release full text of FTA on Friday, official says -
South Korea and the United States have been in discussions to release
the full text of a bilateral free trade agreement (FTA) on Friday, a
senior trade official said Wednesday, amid an indication that the deal’s
renegotiation is imminent.

South Korea, U.S. may release full text of FTA on Friday, official says

SEOUL, May 23 (Yonhap) — South Korea and the United States have been in
discussions to release the full text of a bilateral free trade agreement
(FTA) on Friday, a senior trade official said Wednesday, amid an
indication that the deal’s renegotiation is imminent.

South Korea and the U.S. reached a landmark free trade pact in early
April after 10 months of gruelling negotiations. The deal, expected to
be signed by the end of June, needs to be ratified by South Korea’s
National Assembly and the U.S. Congress.

There has been a high possibility of changes to the agreement since the
administration of U.S. President George W. Bush and the U.S. Congress
inked a bipartisan deal early this month to include tougher labor and
environmental rules in free trade pacts.

"Discussions are underway with the U.S. to release the full text,"
Deputy Trade Minister Kim Han-soo said in a forum earlier in the day,
reiterating the U.S. has yet officially request South Korea to
renegotiate the deal.

South Korean officials worry that if the deal is altered to improve
labor rights, it could deal a blow to local businesses, which are strong
supporters of the deal.

On Tuesday, Ambassador Kim Jong-hoon, South Korea’s chief negotiator in
free trade talks with the U.S., said at a parliamentary meeting that the
government would consider "mutual interests" if the U.S. officially
proposes a renegotiation.

Asked about the likelihood that the U.S. Congress could vote against the
deal if it is not renegotiated, Kim replied, "I think the U.S.
administration is more concerned about that scenario." Under the new
U.S. trade policy guidelines, a free trade agreement should reflect
higher standards to protect workers’ rights, including the right of
workers to form a union and a ban on discrimination in employment.
