Yes. That's exactly what we've done. Pod 6 has:

=item  a C<=use> directive that allows you to load behaviours for
        any user-defined blocks or formatting code you want

=item  a standard mechanism by which user-defined blocks are available
        (just make the block names mixed-case)

=item  a standard mechanism for adding new formatting codes (the M<> metacode)

Of course not. Indeed it's a *plea* for something more concrete to discuss, a 
suggestion of a way to get past the philosophical impasse of one group saying 
"this does everything you want", without nailing down the specifics of how, 
whilst another says "this isn't good enough", without clearly indicating what 
would be.

What I was actually suggesting was that this design *isn't* set in stone, and 
that the best way to convince Larry that the existing design could be better 
is to actually offer a better design.
