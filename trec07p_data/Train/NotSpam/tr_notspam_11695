growth slowest in a decade

**May 15, 2007—**Spending on prescribed drugs in Canada is estimated to
have reached $21.1 billion in 2006, an increase of $1.4 billion over the
previous year, according to figures released today by the **Canadian
Institute for Health Information** (CIHI) in its annual report on drug
spending. While total health spending grew by an estimated 5.8% in 2006,
the projected annual growth rate for prescribed drugs was 6.9%. In
comparison, spending on prescribed drugs increased on average by 11.2%
per year from 1997 to 2004.

//Drug Expenditure in Canada, 1985 to 2006// examines trends in spending
over two decades for both prescribed and non-prescribed drugs (which
include over-the-counter drugs and personal health supplies). Total drug
spending in Canada is estimated to have reached $25.2 billion in 2006,
an increase of 6.0% over the previous year. Spending on non-prescribed
drugs is expected to have reached $4.1 billion in 2006, an increase of
2.0% over the previous year.

Prescribed drugs continue to occupy the biggest share of total drug
spending, accounting for an estimated 83.8% of total drug expenditure in
2006, up from 82.5% in 2004 and 67.5% in 1985.

Since 1997, drugs (including both prescribed and non-prescribed
medications) have accounted for the second-largest share, after
hospitals, among major categories of health spending. The share of drugs
in total health spending has grown over the last two decades, rising
from 9.5% in 1985 to an estimated 17.0% in 2005, a share that is
expected to have remained the same in 2006.


         *International comparisons in drug spending *

When comparing 17 countries in the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) with a similar health reporting
system to Canada’s in 2004 (latest available information), Canada had
the third-highest level of total drug spending (including prescribed and
non-prescribed drugs), at $699 per person, after the United States
($940) and France ($749).

Canada was below the OECD median when it came to how much of the total
drug bill was publicly financed. In 2004, the public share of total drug
spending in Canada was 37.8%. In comparison, at least 70% of the total
drug bill in European countries, such as Luxembourg, Belgium, Spain,
Austria, France and Germany, was financed by the public sector. Poland
(36.5%), the United States (24.4%) and Mexico (11.6%) were the only OECD
countries with shares of public drug expenditures smaller than those of
Canada.

//Drug Expenditure in Canada, 1985 to 2006// provides a descriptive
overview of Canadian drug expenditure trends from 1985 to 2004 and
includes forecasts for 2005 and 2006.
