New Zealand: Drug dosage regimes now patentable
Baldwins, Wellington

The Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand (IPONZ) recently
released a decision of particular significance to the pharmaceutical
industry. The decision follows a hearing at IPONZ on the
patentability of Swiss claims where the novelty of the claimed
subject matter resides in a dosage regime, rather than the active
ingredient or the disease to be treated.

The patent application is jointly owned by Genentech and Washington
University. The active ingredient of the claims, insulin-like growth
factor-1 (IGF-1), was previously known for treating various diseases,
but patients suffered from side effects and the particular problem
that continuous treatment rendered IGF-1 ineffective over time. The
applicants had found that intermittent treatment using IGF-1
maximised efficacy and minimized side effects.

New Zealand does not allow patents for methods of medically treating
humans. This position is in line with the vast majority of countries,
the notable exceptions being the US and Australia. However, following
a decision of the Court of Appeal in 2000, known as the Pharmac case
(Pharmaceutical Management Agency Ltd v The Commission of Patents
[2000] RPC 857), Swiss claims have been allowable in New Zealand.
Swiss claims effectively protect a new use of a known pharmaceutical
ingredient.

However, the interpretation of relevant case law by IPONZ has been
rather restrictive and is reflected in its Guidelines for the
Examination of Swiss-type Claims that were issued in September 2006.
The Guidelines considered the conflicting positions of the UK and
Europe. The UK Court of Appeal in the Bristol-Myers Taxol case
(Bristol-Myers Squibb v Baker Norton Pharmaceuticals [2001] RPC 1)
refused to allow a Swiss claim having a faster administration rate as
its novel feature. In contrast, the decision of the EPO in the
Genentech case (T1020/03) allowed claims equivalent to those that
were the subject of the New Zealand decision. The Guidelines
controversially concluded that the novelty must reside in the newly
discovered purpose (of the known pharmaceutical) and not the mode of
administration or the amount, timing or frequency of dosage.

The latest New Zealand decision reviewed the UK and European
decisions, as well as earlier IPONZ decisions on the issue, and
disagreed with the statement in the Guidelines that claims of this
type are not valid Swiss claims. The IPONZ decision noted that the
applicants had produced a means of overcoming or alleviating problems
associated with the continued use of IGF-1 and that it was proper
that they should be able to obtain patent protection for their
contribution. The decision went on to explain that the only contrary
view was that expressed by the UK Court of Appeal in the Bristol-
Myers Taxol case, and that case, although persuasive, was not binding
in New Zealand nor had it been followed by later European Board of
Appeal cases.

The decision represents a positive step forward for many in the
pharmaceutical industry, and reflects the continued expansion of
areas of pharmaceutical innovation that can be patented in New Zealand.
