I agree. I don't think anyone can, at this stage...

Sounds good.

Hmm. I wonder about the scenario where an OLPC person visits a school in
 Ogbomoso, toting their newest hardware with a dev build which is newer
than the school server build...

Once it's out there, it has to work resiliently, and degrade gracefully.

It will be up the the people on the ground to upgrade, as and when they
choose to. Despite some sort of internets, they may very well not bother
to touch a working installation... (I keep encountering people running
old versions of Ubuntu for no good reason :) So this scenario may also
be triggered by a school swapping out a faulty XO for a new one which
comes preloaded with a newer build... It has to still Just Work.

Hypothetical at this stage but we may want to put in a fall-back on the
XO when we do implement the next algorithm.

Sounds good.

I'm sure the number will be very small :)
