Slackware has the rpm tool available in distro so no need for any script. If
you're doing LFS then "you're on your own" it is not 
reasonable to expect people to make software "LFS compatible". But then if
you're into LFS then surely you can make whatever 
minor tweaks necessary to adapt, and that will be half the fun. Slack and
LFS are two of my fave distros. Less is more :)

The lfs team have a script to unpack debs and rpms.  So that they can 
be installed on a lfs / blfs system.  Can't remember what it is called.  
I guess slackware users would need it too, in that case.
