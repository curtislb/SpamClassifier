For future reference, telling us your version of R and exact OS would have 
helped here.  The R posting guide suggests showing the output of 
sessionInfo().

Also, to help the readers, fitNorm2 (R is case-sensitive) is in 'prada', 
and the missing package is rrcov not robustbase.

That is not the case: rrcov is a separate package, and one prada depends 
on.  So somehow you have managed to install prada without an essential 
dependency 'rrcov'.  That looks like a problem in the Debian/Ubuntu 
packaging of prada.  (There is a list R-sig-debian for such issues.)

Running install.packages("rrcov") inside R should fix this for you: if 
your R is not current (i.e. < 2.5.0) you may need to run R as root for 
that session.  (There may be a Debian package for rrcov for your OS and R 
version, but without further details I cannot check.)

In the current version of prada (1.12.0 for BioC-2.0 for R 2.5.0) rrcov is 
in Imports, so probably your version of BioC is not current either.
