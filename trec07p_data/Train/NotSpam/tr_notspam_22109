Digital Restrictions Management? 'Will encouraging consumer
virtualization result in a major uptick in piracy? Not anytime soon, say
analysts. One of the main obstacles is the massive size of VMs. Because
they include the operating system, the simulated hardware, as well as the
software and/or multimedia files, VMs can easily run in the tens of
gigabytes, making them hard to exchange over the Internet. But DeGroot
says that problem can be partly overcome with .zip and compression tools

The New York Times is reporting on preparations in the works by the US
government to [0]prep for a 'cyberwar'. Precautionary measures are being
taken to guard against concerted attacks by politically-minded (or
well-paid) hackers looking to cause havoc. Though they outline scenarios
where mass damage is the desired outcome (such as remotely opening a
dam's gates to flood cities), most expect such conflicts to be more
subtle. Parts of the internet, for example, may be unreachable or
unreliable for certain countries. Regardless, the article suggests we've
already seen our first low-level cyberwar in Estonia: "The cyberattacks
in Estonia were apparently sparked by tensions over the country's plan to
remove Soviet-era war memorials. Estonian officials initially blamed
Russia for the attacks, suggesting that its state-run computer networks
blocked online access to banks and government offices. The Kremlin denied
the accusations. And Estonian officials ultimately accepted the idea that
perhaps this attack was the work of tech-savvy activists, or
'hactivists,' who have been mounting similar attacks against just about
everyone for several years."

information outside the job scope, keeping unusual work hours, unreported

advances, the result may pave the way for devices of double the size in
the next year or two--closer to what other quantum computing candidates
have achieved, says physicist Hans Mooij of the Delft University of
Technology in the Netherlands. Unlike today's computers, which process
information in the form of 0s and 1s, a quantum computer would achieve
new levels of power by turning bits into fuzzy quantum things called
qubits (pronounced cue-bits) that are 0 and 1 simultaneously. In theory,
quantum computers would allow hackers to crack today's toughest coded
messages and researchers to better simulate molecules for designing new
drugs and materials.'"

activation of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The installation will
start up in May 2008, taking 'the first steps towards studying physics at
a new high-energy frontier.' Such a delay was foreseen [1]due to the
quadrupole accident, which we've previously discussed. This gives extra
time for Fermilab physicists to try to understand the latest interesting
hints of the Higgs boson, as well as give much needed extra-time for the
detectors at CERN to get ready for data taking. Given that it will be
fall before the LHC detectors take any useful data from collisions at
14TeV, could Fermilab collect enough data for a 5-sigma discovery by
then?"
