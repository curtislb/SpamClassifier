PRODUCT PLUNDER OF THE WEEK: HORIZON ANNOUNCES FURTHER LOSSES AS OCA BOYCOT=
T CONTINUES
This week, Horizon, the largest organic dairy company in the U.S., announce=
d, for the second time this year that its profits are decreasing. Horizon d=
airy is one of several brands being boycotted by the OCA and thousands of o=
rganic consumers due to the company's practice of sourcing milk from giant =
dairy feedlots where the animals have little or no access to pasture. Gregg=
 Engles, the CEO of Dean Foods (Horizon's parent company) blamed recent pro=
fit losses on "considerable disruption" in the organic dairy marketplace. W=
hen OCA launched its boycott in 2006, Engles claimed factory farmed organic=
s were necessary in order to produce enough organic milk to meet growing co=
nsumer demands. Ironically, this week Engles said part of the blame for the=
 company's profit losses is due to an oversupply of organic dairy in the ma=
rketplace. Learn more: http://www.organicconsumers.org/rd/boycott.cfm

TARGETS OF OCA'S ONGOING "ORGANIC" FACTORY FARM DAIRY BOYCOTT
Horizon, Costco's "Kirkland Signature," Safeway's "O" organics brand, Publi=
x's "High Meadows, "Giant's "Natures Promise," "Woodstock Farms" and Wild O=
ats' organic milk.

OCA ALERT UPDATE: SUCCESS! FACTORY FARM DAIRY SUPPLYING HORIZON LOSES ORGAN=
IC CERTIFICATION
After more than a year of efforts to raise public awareness, the OCA and th=
e Cornucopia Institute celebrated a major victory last week when, for the f=
irst time, a massive 10,000 head intensive confinement California feedlot d=
airy had its organic certification suspended. Prior to OCA's boycott, this =
factory farm supplied Horizon Organic. "This is a big victory for the farm =
families around the country who work so hard to create milk and dairy produ=
cts that meet a high ethical standard," said Mark Kastel, Cornucopia's seni=
or farm policy analyst. The Cornucopia Institute says that the good news ab=
out organic dairy products is that the vast majority are produced with high=
 integrity and meet the spirit and letter of the organic law. Learn more: h=

OCA FARM BILL ALERT UPDATE: CONGRESS CONSIDERING NEARLY $200 MILLION FUNDIN=
G FOR ORGANICS
In the past few issues of Organic Bytes, the OCA has been alerting its read=
ers to contact various congressional subcommittees who are in the process o=
f allocating funding for the 2007 Farm Bill. This massive piece of legislat=
ion provides funding until 2012 and includes a variety of programs that wou=
ld benefit organic farmers, sustainable agriculture and the environment. Th=
anks to your efforts and the concerted work of OCA's allies, many of these =
target programs have been allocated funding.
=09

Specifically, the following funding has been approved in subcommittees for =
organic and sustainable agriculture related programs over the course of the=
 next five years:

* $150 million to examine optimal conservation and environmental outcomes f=
or organically produced agricultural products, and to develop new and impro=
ved seed varieties that are particularly suited for organic agriculture.
* $22 million to help farmers pay for organic certification
* $5 million for outreach to organic and specialty crop producers.
* $3 million to collect market and production data about organic farming.

The OCA will continue to alert you to new issues arising in this arena, as =
the 2007 Farm Bill continues to be developed by Congress. Learn more: http:=

FEATURE STORY -- OCA ALERT UPDATE: USDA'S NEWEST SNEAK ATTACK ON ORGANIC ST=
ANDARDS
Thanks to all of you who joined thousands of organic consumers in late May =
and signed OCA's petition to the USDA opposing the agency's latest "Sneak A=
ttack" to allow 38 new non-organic ingredients in products labeled as "USDA=
 Organic". (Read full petition here: http://www.organicconsumers.org/articl=
es/article_5225.cfm)

USDA's controversial proposal to allow 38 new non-organic ingredients in pr=
oducts labeled as "organic" has fueled the anger of organic consumers and g=
enerated a backlash of negative press coast to coast. Over the weekend the =
New York Times and the L.A. Times (as well as a number of other major news =
outlets) ran feature stories on the debacle.

The New York Times noted that the mega-brewer Anheuser-Busch pressured the =
USDA into allowing them to use hops grown with pesticides and chemical fert=
ilizers in their "Organic Wild Hop Lager" beer. In the Los Angeles Times, R=
onnie Cummins, OCA's National Director, was quoted as saying, "This proposa=
l is blatant catering to powerful industry players who want the benefits of=
 labeling their products 'USDA organic' without doing the work to source or=
ganic materials."

Although industry was given the better part of two years to work with the U=
SDA in developing this proposal, the agency only gave the public a brief 7-=
day comment period. During that short time, the OCA generated over 8,000 pe=
tition signatures telling the USDA to back off on allowing non-organic hops=
, factory-farmed animal intestines, tainted fish oil, and other problematic=
 ingredients in organic products.

On Friday June 8, the USDA took its third swing at organic standards and st=
ruck out, violating federal law by refusing to respond to a federal court o=
rder to stop allowing companies to use the 38 non-organic ingredients propo=
sed for inclusion in products labeled "USDA Organic". Unprepared for the fi=
restorm of protest against their latest Sneak Attack, the USDA has been ref=
using to talk to the press.

=09

RECENT HISTORY OF USDA ORGANIC LAWBREAKING
January 2005 (Strike One): Federal court rules that the USDA has violated f=
ederal regulations in allowing conventional and synthetic ingredients in pr=
oducts labeled as "organic".

May 2007 (Strike Two): After heavy lobbying from industry, USDA proposed to=
 allow 38 conventionally grown ingredients in foods labeled as organic. One=
 of those ingredients, fish oil, has never undergone review, which is a vio=
lation of federal law.

June 2007 (Strike Three): A federal judge had given the USDA until midnight=
 Friday (6/8) to post its final ruling, which the agency failed to do.
=09

YOUR HELP IS STILL NEEDED
We need to put a lot more pressure on the USDA, demanding they re-open the =
public comment period on this issue. Industry was given two years, and the =
public was only given 7 days. Through that process, it appears the organic =
standards will be significantly weakened unless we can generate enough comm=
ents to force the USDA to reconsider its proposal to weaken organic standar=
ds.

Please forward this email to all interested friends and colleagues and send=
 a letter to the USDA here: http://www.organicconsumers.org/articles/articl=
e_5225.cfm
