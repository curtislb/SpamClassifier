SATURDAY ON  <http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/48hours/main3410.shtml> 48 HO=
URS

Here's a note from Bill Lagattuta on Saturday's 48 Hours Mystery, NIGHTMARE=
 IN NAPA:=20

"Our story this week sounds a lot like the plot of one of those Hollywood s=
lasher flicks. But this story really happened. Two young women viciously mu=
rdered in their home by an unknown attacker with a knife who disappeared in=
to the night. And it happened on Halloween. The scene of the crime was the =
beautiful Napa Valley, America's premiere wine country in California. That =
made the crime seem even more brutal because killings like that are unheard=
 of in Napa. As we covered the story of the crime three years ago, the kill=
er was still at large and the chance of finding him began to dwindle with e=
ach passing month. The families grew frustrated as police seemed unable to =
turn up new evidence or find suspects. And then it happened... an ending to=
 this story almost a year to the month of the murders. I won't spoil it... =
the accused killer is someone no one suspected. I hope you'll join us on Sa=
turday night."=20

- Bill Lagattuta=20

48 Hours Mystery airs Saturdays at 10pmET/PT=20

FOR MORE ON THIS STORY, WHY NOT READ THE BOOK?=20

48 Hours Mystery, Nightmare in Napa is now available in bookstores and onli=
ne at Amazon.com  <http://www.amazon.com/Nightmare-Napa-Wine-Country-Murder=
s/dp/1416543651> Click Here. This is the first in a brand new series of tru=
e crime books published by Simon and Schuster, Pocket Books. Here's more fr=
om 48 Hours producer and author Paul LaRosa.=20

"Nightmare in Napa is the first in a series of true crime books based on th=
e broadcasts of CBS News' 48 Hours Mystery. It is the chilling story of wha=
t happened to two women in a house in Napa, California on Halloween night, =
2004.=20

48 Hours Mystery already had produced an hour on the story when Executive P=
roducer Susan Zirinsky and Executive Editor Al Briganti hatched the idea to=
 do a series of true crime books. They asked me to get involved and write t=
he first book because I had then recently published a true crime book of my=
 own called Tacoma Confidential.=20

I began reviewing all the tapes from the Napa broadcast and, as always, the=
re were a lot. That's something most viewers do not realize. In producing a=
ny hour for 48 Hours Mystery, producers typically will supervise the videot=
aping of more than one hundred hours of interviews and other material. All =
of those hours are edited down to make a compelling, fast-moving, one-hour =
broadcast for prime-time television. This should give you an idea of the we=
alth and breadth of material we compile for each broadcast. Because of time=
 restrictions, a lot of material never makes it onto the air. So much is le=
ft out that, well, you could write a book, and that's just what we're going=
 to do in this series.=20

Just under three-hundred, thirty-minute tapes existed for the first hour. I=
 went through a good portion of them but decided I had to go to Napa and me=
et the principals and get a feel for the town and the Napa Valley. So that'=
s what I did. I got to meet, have lunch with or email many of those involve=
d with the story. In some cases, I did original reporting. The original hou=
r ended with the arrest of the murderer but now the case had to wind its wa=
y through the courts. I followed it every step of the way, culminating with=
 the dramatic sentencing of the defendant in January, 2007.=20

Along the way, I got a real sense for the lives of the two murder victims: =
Adriane Insogna and Leslie Mazzara, and I hope that I've been true to their=
 memories in the book. They were both special young women whose families ar=
e heartbroken by their loss. In many ways, the most surprising aspect of th=
e story is not the murder itself but the identity of the murderer and his r=
easons for doing what he did.=20

HERE'S WHAT WE HAVE PLANNED FOR SUNDAY  <http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/su=
nday/main3445.shtml> MORNING

CHARLES OSGOOD ANCHORS FROM NEW YORK=20

VIRGINIA TECH: After a week of watching and analyzing every nuance of the h=
orrific events at Virginia Tech, what have we learned? As a nation, we've b=
een in this situation before and it seems to be playing out in a very simil=
ar manner. So are we all-talk or are we accomplishing something? If so, wha=
t? After all, at the bottom of every report and every debate is the desire =
for everyone to be safe all the time. Is that possible? And what are we wil=
ling to give up in order to make that possible? What factors are contributi=
ng to these shootings? And is there something inherently American about the=
m? Correspondent Martha Teichner looks for answers on Sunday Morning.=20

JOEL GREY: Joel Grey is one of just a handful of actors to win an Oscar and=
 a Tony for the same role. He was the Emcee in Cabaret, and went on to star=
 on stage, film and television. But it turns out Grey is as comfortable beh=
ind a camera as in front of one. At the age of 75, he's developed a second =
career as a photographer. In this Sunday Morning Profile, Correspondent Rit=

s.=20

RACHEL CARSON: Mild-mannered scientist and writer Rachel Carson was an unli=
kely activist, but her book, Silent Spring, is credited with starting the e=
nvironmental movement. Her legacy can be seen in the formation of the Envir=
onmental Protection Agency, which in 1972 banned the DDT pesticide in this =
country, and can be found in today's debates over global warming, clean ene=
rgy, and organic food. Correspondent Thalia Assuras reports.=20

LEE IACOCCA: Correspondent Anthony Mason talks to Lee Iacocca about his new=
 book, Where Have All the Leaders Gone?=20

PLASTIC BAGS: When you head to the grocery story, chances are you come out =
with a whole car load of plastic bags. They've become so commonplace in Ame=
rica that discarded bags are taking up a lot of room in our nation's landfi=
lls... and increasingly they've become an environmental concern. One U.S. c=
ity recently decided to take on this growing problem with an all-out ban on=
 plastic grocery bags. John Blackstone reports.=20
