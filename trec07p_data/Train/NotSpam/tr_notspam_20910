						<b>ZOMBIE BROWN</B>
<br>

<br>
One week to go before Zombie Brown takes over at Number 10. Are you excited=
 yet?
<br>

<br>
Tonight he dons his lounge suit to give his final speech to the City great =
and good at the Mansion House. Stephanie Flanders will be there to hear wha=
t he says.
<br>

<br>
<B>EQUITY</B>
<br>

<br>
She'll also be reporting on the continuing row over the 10% tax break enjoy=
ed by those private equity buccaneers who've made such a splash of late. We=
 first reported that row in February - watch that report <b><a href=3D"http=
://news.bbc.co.uk/player/nol/newsid_6220000/newsid_6222800/6222868.stm?bw=
=3Dbb&mp=3Drm">here.</b></a>=20
<br>

<br>
But is it really sustainable for a chancellor who has talked about ending p=
overty to allow the mega rich to benefit from a lower tax rate than their o=
ffice cleaners?
<br>

<br>
<B>LIB DEMS</B>
<br>

<br>
Also more confirmation today about the talks between Zombie Brown and the L=
iberal Democrats. What have they been about? Michael Crick is on the case.
<br>

<br>
Michael first reported on this story back in May, and he even asked Zombie =
Brown about it - you can watch his report <B><A HREF=3D"http://news.bbc.co.=
uk/player/nol/newsid_6220000/newsid_6222100/6222190.stm?bw=3Dbb&mp=3Drm">he=
re</B></A>.
<br>

<br>
<B>EUROPE</B>
<br>

<br>
And that item on top of the Zombie Brown in-tray - should I, should I not h=
ave a referendum on the treaty? David Grossman has the latest on public opi=
nion from Brussels.
<br>

<br>
<b>CREDIT CARD FRAUD</b>
<br>

<br>
Also, credit card fraud - do the police care any more? The latest Home Offi=
ce rules say the public should not bother the police if their credit card d=
etails are used by a fraudster - only banks can report this crime. Is this =
a green light to more credit card theft? Martin Shankleman has all the deta=
ils.
<br>

<br>
<B>BLAIR</B>
<br>

<br>
Finally what about the man who is currently in the PM's job? Tony Blair and=
 David Cameron had their usual clash at PMQs today. The next time that happ=
ens will be on Tony Blair's last day. Those who've faced Tony Blair across =
the dispatch box give us an insight into just what a formidable opponent he=
 was and still is.
<br>

<br>
Jeremy will be hosting the debate at 10.30. Do join him.
<br>

<br>
