     I'm not just a console user.  Nor do I mind my display being 
fiddled with to any degree, as long as it's no more than my display. 
Ever take a look at Google Analytics?  It's incredible just how much 
data they can get out of a web page.  The only problem is all that data 
can !only! be used to exploit their customers by prying open their 
wallets and getting at whatever's inside.  I can do without all the 
grifting.  HTML alone should be enough to get our money.  They certainly 
don't need to take control of my computer to spam the bejesus out of me. 
  I know what I'm looking for to buy.   I don't like having things 
shoved in my face.  It's rude and just plain wrong, and if they want to 
do business that way, I'd rather be on the side of caution and shop 
anywhere else.

         Michael
