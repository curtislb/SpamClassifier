By itself, nothing. But in a lawsuit in the context of a license with a
choice-of-venue clause, either you live in the jurisdiction that is
claimed in the license (in which case not much changes wrt what would be
the case if there were no choice-of-venue clause in the first place), or
you do not (in which case the above is appropriate).

What I was trying to show is that the relevance of a copyright case
brought against you in a jurisdiction outside of your immediate concern
is zero, for all practical matters; that means you can simply ignore it,
and nothing Bad will happen. Therefore, I don't think it makes it
anything even remotely representing non-freeness.

If you are a company or other organization which is large enough that
choice-of-venue clauses do matter, then you probably do have contacts
with a lawyer in the appropriate jurisdiction whom you can ask to
represent you, anyway.

Seen how the Belgian Government wrote the first license in
/usr/share/doc/libbeid2/copyright (in particular section 6.3 of that
license), I guess they do.
