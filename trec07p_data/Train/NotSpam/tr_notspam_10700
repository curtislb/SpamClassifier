It seems that you've stumbled upon an undocumented implementation
limitation. Perl doesn't have too many of those, and it probably
shouldn't have any. Now that you have a test case, I encourage you to
run perlbug to submit it with a request that it be fixed or
documented. (I suspect, though, that the real limitation is in your OS
or shell, rather than Perl; so the only fix will be to the
documentation.)

But what's in the qx``, an entire shell script? Maybe there's a better
way to do whatever you're trying to do.

When a string within qx`` contains shell metacharacters, the string is
passed to /bin/sh on Unix systems. So you're starting a shell, and
giving it a large program to run. The shell is going to launch one or
more other programs. Maybe your program could launch those programs
directly, leaving the shell out of things, and saving that much memory
and time, not to mention bypassing any limitations the shell imposes.

Good luck with it!
