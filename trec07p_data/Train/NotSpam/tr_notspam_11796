just a guess is all. either way it probably wouldn't have mattered since 
it's still a class c address. There is a certain disagreement somewhere 
between the nic card and the router..unless the ip suddenly changes for 
wherever reason I'd say set the nic card on the linux box to have a static 
address. but either way I've never had a problem with it though it is a pain 
to keep up with when you do have a dynamic ip. try disabling it on the 
router and enabling static ip's on the machines.
