REFORMING HEALTH CARE TO MAKE IT AFFORDABLE, ACCOUNTABLE, AND UNIVERSAL

(Fact sheet on John Edwards' healthcare plan, released by his campaign)
June 14, 2007

[snip]

• Pursue Prizes as Innovation Incentives: Edwards will convene an expert
panel to identify disorders where prizes – not patent monopolies—would
offer new incentives to researchers, guaranteed gains to companies, and
lower costs to patients. Drug companies would know that if they
generated a life-saving breakthrough, they would be guaranteed a
significant payment in exchange for allowing competition in
manufacturing and distribution. With prizes, the government will pay
more up front, but it will save taxpayers in the end because companies
will generate breakthrough drugs more quickly and at a lower cost. Key
questions about the pricing of prizes, the appropriateness of prizes for
different diseases, and the relationship to patent protections remain to
be resolved, but prizes are a promising innovation that Edwards will
pursue.[88]
