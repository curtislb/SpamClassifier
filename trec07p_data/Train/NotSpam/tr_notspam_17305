There's groups of friends who do each other favours.

There's people who are so poor they have to barter - you're aware, of 
course, that in Eastern Europe that was quite normal - cash was 
worthless. Even between businesses and governments - there was a 
thriving barter market worth millions of pounds without any money 
changing hands at all...

There's plenty of "societies" where I live (England) who have a system 
(yes I know it's like money) where you earn points and trade them.

And one only has to look close to home at the world of Free Software, 
where code and respect are the items of currency, not money :-)

Cheers,
Wol
