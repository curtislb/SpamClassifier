The character itself isn't non-free, but rather the character being used
with the designated colors/directions:

To be restricted, the symbol has to have the same proportions that
were approved by the Assembly, it must be white on a dark blue
background, and facing right.

But this, I don't quite understand:

By the symbol do they mean the basic wheelchair, or the whole thing
with all of the colors? I'd try to contact someone and see what they
mean by that, because otherwise I may be interpereting this wrong.

If the restrictions are only places on the right-facing, white on
blue wheelchair then it should be fine to redistribute. If by "symbol"
they mean the basic wheelchair, then redistribution wouldn't fall
under DFSG-free terms from what I can tell.
