Hello Gurus,

I have a html page which has hyper links only it does not have any images.

I have to read the html file get the names of the hyper link that is
displayed in the page ,create a directory structure and tar/gz the files.

( I have the directories in server with same names which are  displayed in
html page)

The directory structure should be according to the tab order in the html
page.

*I have attached the html page also.*

If I could get the names of the hyperl inks that are displayed in the html
file as per directory structure then I could tar/.gz the files,. But I have
no idea of html parsing using perl.

Is there any way that I  could create a xml file from the html file so that
I could parse the xml file.

Please Help me in getting the hyper links displayed in the html page
according to the directory structure.


Thanks in Advance.
Kiran
