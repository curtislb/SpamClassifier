5:58 PM, 5/30/07, Update: Debris panels moved; antenna work on tap

Space station commander Fyodor Yurchikhin and flight engineer Oleg Kotov ar=
e midway through a spacewalk to install micrometeoroid debris shields and r=
e-route a Global Positioning System antenna cable. While the spacewalk bega=
n about 45 minutes late because of communications problems, the cosmonauts =
have made up lost time and flight controllers expect the excursion to end r=
oughly on schedule, around 8:20 p.m.

The cosmonauts have retrieved the debris panels from their storage point on=
 the Unity module and moved them to the front section of the Zvezda command=
 module using a telescoping boom. Before installing the shields, however, t=
he spacewalkers made their way to the back of the command module to reposit=
ion the GPS cable, part of a system that will provide navigation data to ap=
proaching unmanned European Space Agency cargo craft.

Once the cable work is complete, Yurchikhin and Kotov will install five of =
17 debris panels before calling it a day and returning to the Pirs airlock =
module. The remaining 12 panels will be installed next week.
