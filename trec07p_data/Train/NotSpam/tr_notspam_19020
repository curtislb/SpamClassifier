The negotiations on the development agenda text have progressed, and as of
last evening, it appears as though the term "access to knowledge" is now
without brackets.  The relevant paragraph now reads as follows:

 "To initiate discussions on how, within WIPO's mandate, to further
facilitate access to knowledge and technology for developing countries
and  LDCs to foster creativity and innovation and to strengthen such
existing  activities within WIPO."

I think this is a very good outcome, and gives WIPO the mandate that it
needs to move forward in this area.

Some of the Group B countries had difficulty explaining why they were
opposed to WIPO discussing "access to knowledge."  Even more important,
the developing country delegations were very strong on this issue.   Now
it will be necessary to build the case for specific A2K initiatives at
WIPO, in the environment were WIPO has agreed that the topic is relevant
and appropriate.

Many particpants in the "green room" discussions here say the atmosphere
has been quite good this week, from everyone, including the Group B
countries and the WIPO Secretariat.

On a personal note, I was robbed last evening, and my computer was taken,
so if you don't hear from me for a while, don't take it personally. I lost
all of my phone numbers and email addresses, not to mention a lot more.
