Ok, that makes sense.

That's fair enough.  With -G, I get to test 395 in p5regex/p5rx.t.  
Without the -G, I memory usage still grows, and I only get to test 185 
before getting the PANIC.  Running with --gc-debug, I only got to test 
190. (The exact test number seems to fluctuate from run to run.  However, 
since each test run of p5rx.t with garbage collection enabled takes over 7 
minutes, I haven't done a lot of runs.)

That's entirely up to you.
