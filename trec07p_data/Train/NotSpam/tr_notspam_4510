Greetings,

My name is Christine C. Maasdam. I am presently a subscriber to the  
msn-list link.

I would like to inquire into how one becomes professionally involved  
in the developing field of protection and security of art.

I hold a B.A. in Geography and a M.A. in Humanities. I am completing  
a Certification in Museum Studies with Lanier Graham at East Bay- 
Hayward.

Are there any forums, symposiums or programs that your organizations  
could point me towards?  I am aware of the IFCPP and am prepared to  
attend the Chicago Workshop offered in conjunction with the AAM  
Convention. I would be greatly interested in a more in depth program  
that would merge the academic with the security considerations.

I would certainly appreciate and value your insight.

Thanking you in advance.

Best thoughts,

Christine C. Maasdam

  Egyptian statue that cost council ?440,000 is a forgery

23.04.07

The offer from the antiques dealer seemed too good to be true.

He had a 3,000-year-old Egyptian artefact, a statue of King Tut's 
half-sister, which had been in his family for more than a century.

And although it was worth ?1million, he was prepared to sell it to his 
local authority for a knockdown ?440,000 so it could remain in his home 
town.

After experts from the British Museum and Christie's had vouched for its 
authenticity, Bolton Council raised the money to buy the sculpture, 
known as the Amarna Princess.

It was not until three years later, when a similar item arrived at the 
Museum, that the Princess's guilty secret was exposed.

She was a fake. Far from being made in Ancient Egypt, the alabaster 
sculpture has more in common with Modern Lancashire. Police believe the 
sculpture was created in Bolton. When they raided a house in the town, 
they discovered marble and other artists' equipment inside.

An elderly couple and their two sons have been arrested and charged with 
offences connected to forgery.

The 20-inch figure was said to date back to 1350 BC, and to be one of 
only three known pieces from the period in existence. The forgery came 
to light when another sculpture, from Syria, was sent by a private 
client for examination at the British Museum.

This time, experts failed to be taken in and on further investigation 
discovered that it must have come from the same dubious source as the 
Amarna Princess. Scotland Yard's Arts and Antiques squad seized the 
Syrian relief, along with two other pieces from London, and impounded 
the Princess. But by then the sculpture, much feted despite its lack of 
head, arms or lower legs, had been proudly displayed across Britain.

The vendor had claimed that his great-grandfather had bought it at the 
auction of the property of the Earl of Egremont in 1892. Bolton council 
officials who uncovered a copy of the sale catalogue were unable to find 
any mention of the Princess in it. But they went ahead anyway.

Grants were obtained of ?360,000 from the National Heritage Memorial 
Fund, a part-Government funded body, as well as ?75,000 from the 
independent charity the National Art Collections Fund and ? 2,500 from 
the Friends of Bolton Museum and Art Gallery.

A series of experts said that the woman was the daughter of King 
Akhenaten and Nefertiti, his most senior wife. Akhenaten was succeeded 
by Tutankhamun, his son by another wife.

The sculpture initially went on display at the the Hayward Gallery, on 
London's South Bank, as part of its Saved! celebration of 100 years of 
saving art for the nation, before being moved to Bolton Museum in 
January 2004.

At the time, securing the Princess was hailed as a great coup for the 
town. Councillor Laurie Williamson, spokesman on culture, said: 'This 
latest addition will enhance Bolton's reputation as a cultural 
destination.' Last week, antiques dealer George Greenhalgh, 84, and his 
82-year- old wife Olive were quizzed by detectives from the Metropolitan 
Police.

The couple and their 52-year- old son, Shaun, have each been charged 
with conspiracy to defraud, including alleged offences of selling faked 
and forged works as genuine between 1989 and 2006 and money laundering 
the proceeds of the sale of such antiques.

George Greenhalgh and Shaun Greenhalgh also face an additional charge of 
laundering the proceeds of the sale of the Amarna Princess.

The couple's elder son, George jnr, aged 53, has also been charged with 
money laundering. The four are due to face Bolton magistrates on Thursday.

Dealer changes position in dispute over Renoir-Guino bronzes

By Georgina Adam 
<http://www.theartnewspaper.com/aabout/creditemail.asp?strCredit=Georgina%20Adam> 
| Posted 23 April 2007

LONDON. Emmanuel Javogue, a US-based dealer who has opposed Renoir?s 
great-grandson Emmanuel in a long-running dispute over copyright to 
Renoir bronzes in the US, has now changed his position. He now claims 
that many pieces he believed were authentic may actually be unauthorised 
fakes.

Many ?Renoir-Guino? bronzes sold on the market have authenticity 
problems, he says. ?I am disappointed by how the two families are 
handling the heritage of their ancestors,? he told /The Art Newspaper/. 
?There is no respect for the oeuvre, it?s all about the money they can 
make.?

?Renoir-Guino? bronzes were made at the end of Renoir?s life when the 
artist used an assistant, Richard Guino, as his ?hands?. With Auguste 
Renoir, Guino won joint copyright to these pieces, which has passed to 
Guino?s heirs. They have produced and sold the bronzes for many years, 
as well as issuing certificates of authenticity.

Mr Javogue was associated with the Guinos for some years as their US 
representative and sold some pieces. He now says that the Guinos have 
produced sculptures with the same edition numbers, claims that the 
family deny.

His change of opinion comes during a long-running series of lawsuits 
between the Guinos and Emmanuel Renoir, who is claiming the right to 
reproduce Renoir-Guino pieces in the US.

The Guinos accuse Mr Renoir and his partners of making unauthorised 
repro?ductions of the sculptures from original plasters to sell in the 
US, a charge Mr Renoir denies because he says the works are in the 
public domain in the US and so cannot be copyrighted.

In a sworn statement seen by /The Art Newspaper/, Mr Javogue says he now 
has ?concerns? about a Venus Victrix he consigned to Christie?s and 
which the firm sold in New York on 5 May 2005 for $284,800; it was 
numbered EA I/IV, with a Valsuani founder?s mark. The problem, according 
to court papers filed in France, was that another sculpture with the 
same number was sold by Michel Guino to the Michido Gallery in Japan in 
1993, for FFr1.6m ($282,000). Mr Javogue?s statement mentions a number 
of other pieces which he says are problematic, as well as accusing 
Michel Guino (one of the heirs) of producing false certificates of 
authenticity.

According to the Guinos? US lawyer Richard Morris, his clients ?deny 
having made any unauthorised pieces?the owner of the copyright cannot by 
definition make an unauthorised piece. Further, [they deny] ?double 
numbering? or any other impropriety.? Mr Renoir has brought a suit in 
France accusing Michel Guino of making unauthorised pieces. Christie?s 
said in a statement: ?We are monitoring the matter. As with all 
properties sold at Christie?s, this bronze was researched prior to sale 
by specialists, and?we also worked with an outside authority. Both 
Christie?s and the authority concluded that there were no issues with 
the work.?

    Gewissen oder Geldgier


  Konferenz zum Thema Raubkunst

WELF GROMBACHER

Bis vor kurzem gab es hinter vorgehaltener Hand in Berlin eine 
Anweisung, wonach Bilder der Bundeskunstsammlung, bei denen Gefahr 
bestehen k?nnte, dass Restitutionsforderungen geltend gemacht werden, 
nichts in Amtsstuben mit ?ffentlichem Publikumsverkehr zu suchen haben. 
Man wei? ja nie. Am Ende k?nnte jemand in einem Ministerium ein Gem?lde 
aus ehemals j?dischem Familienbesitz entdecken, das im Dritten Reich von 
den Nazis enteignet wurde, und es zur?ck haben wollen.

Die Angelegenheit zeigt, dass in Sachen Beutekunst und R?ck?bertragung 
in Deutschland immer noch Redebedarf besteht. Auch, wenn einige meinen, 
mehr als 60 Jahre nach Kriegsende sei es an der Zeit, die Sache endlich 
ruhen zu lassen. Seit Sonntag findet in Potsdam nun eine internationale 
Konferenz zum Thema statt. Eingeladen vom Moses Mendelssohn Zentrum 
(MMZ), debattieren 250 Experten aus zw?lf L?ndern ?ber moralische, 
juristische und politische Fragen.

In der vergangenen Zeit sei oft auf eine polemische, emotionale Art ?ber 
Raubkunst gesprochen worden, wie Julius H. Schoeps, Direktor des MMZ, 
meinte, was nicht zu einer Kl?rung, sondern zu noch mehr Verwirrung 
beigetragen habe. Die Konferenz wolle darum helfen, den Diskurs zu 
versachlichen und konstruktive L?sungsans?tze zu erarbeiten.

*Wabernder Moralraum*

"Eine Debatte ohne Ende?" ist das Motto des dreit?gigen Symposiums. Und 
das Fragezeichen kann durchaus als ein rein rhetorisches verstanden 
werden, wie Michael Naumann in seinem Er?ffnungsvortrag am Sonntag schon 
klarstellte. Die Washingtoner Erkl?rung von 1998, in der sich 44 Staaten 
dazu verpflichtet haben, den R?ck?bertragungen nachzukommen, habe 
deutlich gemacht, dass Anspr?che nicht verj?hren. In einer vehementen 
Rede sprach sich der ehemalige Kulturstaatsminister und heutige 
"Zeit"-Herausgeber gegen die von Juristen immer wieder geforderten 
Fristen aus. "Derlei Fristen dienen zwar dem Rechtsfrieden. Der 
Rechtsfrieden aber ist nicht gleichzusetzen mit Gerechtigkeit", so Naumann.

Dieser Meinung sind nicht alle. "Wir brauchen klare Fristen, um den 
Druck auf alle Beteiligten zu erh?hen, sich f?r das Thema einzusetzen", 
forderte etwa der M?nchner Rechtsanwalt Hannes Hartung, der zu den 
Referenten des Symposiums z?hlt. "Bislang befinden wir uns in einem 
wabernden Moralraum." Hartungs Ansicht nach w?re ein Limit bis 2020 f?r 
die Anmeldung von Besitzanspr?chen hilfreich. "Diese Frist kann aber nur 
dann funktionieren, wenn bis dahin die Thematik durch eine l?ckenlose 
Provenienzforschung in den betroffenen ?ffentlichen und privaten 
Institutionen aufbereitet ist."

*Nachschub f?r den Kunstmarkt?*

Genau hier aber liegt das Problem. Nur wenige Museen sind finanziell 
dazu in der Lage, Provenienzforschung zu leisten und fr?here Besitzer 
ausfindig zu machen. Mal ganz davon abgesehen, dass es nicht wirklich in 
ihrem Interesse liegt, sich selbst die eigenen Exponate abzusprechen, um 
sie an Alteigent?mer zur?ck zu geben. Zwischen 1933 und 1945 sind 650 
000 Kunstwerke in den Besitz der Nationalsozialisten ?bergegangen. 
Michael Naumann sprach vom "umfangreichsten Kunstdiebstahl der deutschen 
Geschichte". 100 000 Werke davon seien bis heute spurlos verschwunden.

Es k?nne nicht angehen, den j?dischen Erben Geldgier vorzuwerfen, wie es 
vor kurzem im Rahmen der R?ckgabe von Ernst Ludwig Kirchners "Berliner 
Stra?enszene" passiert sei. Mit ungewohnt harten Worten griff Naumann 
die R?delsf?hrer der Debatte an und nannte sie mit Namen, wie 
beispielsweise den Chef des Auktionshauses Villa Grisebach, Bernd 
Schultz. Der hatte in der "Frankfurter Allgemeinen" damals geschrieben: 
"Man sagt Holocaust und meint Geld" und von "ausgebufften 
Restitutionsanw?lten in den Vereinigten Staaten" gesprochen, die in den 
Depots deutscher Museen lediglich "Nachschub f?r den internationalen 
Kunstmarkt" wittern. Naumann trat daf?r ein, dass auch diesen Kritikern 
bei der Nennung des Wortes "Holocaust" bald nicht mehr Geld in den Sinn 
komme, sondern vielmehr "Schuld" und "Verantwortung".

/Konferenz "Eine Debatte ohne Ende? Raubkunst und Restitution im 
deutschsprachigen Raum": Heute, 9.15-16 Uhr. Altes Rathaus, Am Alten 
Markt, Potsdam./

  Court rules Italy should return Venus to Libya

/Mon Apr 23, 1:09 PM ET/

Italy can return to Libya an ancient statue of Venus taken to Rome 
during Italian colonial rule in 1912, after a court ruled on Monday it 
was not part of Italy's cultural heritage.

The headless "Venus of Cyrene" was carried away from the town of Cyrene 
-- an ancient Greek colony -- by Italian troops and put on display in Rome.

Former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's promise to return it on a 
visit to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2002 was blocked by legal 
action lodged by a group called "Our Italy," whose aim is to keep 
Italy's cultural treasures in Italian ownership.

Alessandro Ruffini, lawyer for the Libyan embassy in Rome, told Reuters 
the Lazio appeals court ruling that Italy did not have an historic claim 
to the statue was "well grounded."

He said this could set a helpful precedent for Italy's own efforts to 
recover works of art smuggled abroad.

Some Italians oppose the return of such works of art, with National 
Alliance deputy Fabio Rampelli lamenting "the systematic looting of 
Italy's 'naturalized' artistic heritage."

He hoped the Venus would not "suffer the same fate" as the ancient Axum 
Obelisc which troops of dictator Benito Mussolini took from what was 
then Abyssinia in 1937. It was returned to Ethiopia to be "abandoned on 
a rooftop," according to Rampelli.

Late last year Rome was rebuffed by the Getty Museum when it requested 
the return of a 2,500-year-old Greek statue of a boy. Italy threatened 
to break off ties with the wealthy Los Angeles museum over the statue 
and other works that it says were looted.

  Replica of prehistoric croc stolen

NAPLES --
(AP) -- The fiberglass model of an eight-foot primitive crocodile looked 
real enough to slither off, so the staff at the Naples Botanical Garden 
knew something was amiss when visitors weren't commenting on the 
realistic replica.

The $15,000 Crocodile Africanas replica was gone. The staff believes it 
was taken the night of April 14 when the facility's gate was open but 
most of the visitors were indoors. They reported the theft to the 
Collier County Sheriff's Office on April 16.

''It's so sad,'' said Jill Barry, Naples Botanical Garden director of 
external affairs. ``We're hoping they didn't understand it was an item 
of great value. It qualifies as grand theft. We're hoping someone will 
return it so we do not have to pursue further action.''

The crocodile was among about two dozen prehistoric creatures on display 
during the /Dinosaurs in the Garden /exhibit. The life-size fiberglass 
dinosaur sculptures are part of a traveling show made by Missouri artist 
and fossil collector Guy Darrough.

''It's one of a kind,'' Barry said of the stolen crocodile. ``It's 
essentially a work of art.''

  Foreign smugglers target China's sunken treasures

Mon Apr 23, 2007 10:36PM EDT

BEIJING (Reuters) - Foreign smugglers are making use of advanced 
technology to steal China's seabed treasures, mostly priceless porcelain 
from ancient shipwrecks, the China Daily said on Tuesday.

The relics, from thousands of sunken ships, were traded beyond China's 
maritime boundaries before they are shipped to markets worldwide, many 
to the United States, the newspaper said.

Shan Jixiang, director of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage, 
was quoted as saying the government had recovered a "great number" of 
precious items stolen from the country in the past few decades.

China's seabed heritage has been pursued in earnest by art collectors 
and dealers since the beginning of 2005, when about 15,000 pieces, 
mainly blue-and-white porcelain about 300 years old, were found in a 
shipwreck off the coast of east China's Fujian province.

  Oslo court sentences three in theft of Munch paintings


        Published: 24 April 2007

An Oslo appeals court sentenced three men to prison terms of up to nine 
and a half years yesterday for their roles in the 2004 theft of the 
Edvard Munch masterpieces "The Scream" and "Madonna."

The paintings, which were insured for 750 million kroner (US$125 
million), were recovered by police on 31 August, just over two years 
after they were stolen by masked gunmen in a brazen daylight heist at 
Oslo's Munch Museum. Both were damaged and are undergoing repairs.

The three defendants were also ordered to jointly pay 1.57 million 
kroner (US$262 million) in compensation to the City of Oslo, which owns 
the paintings.

There are four versions of "The Scream," probably Munch's best-known 
work, depicting a waif-like figure apparently screaming or hearing a 
scream. The image has become an icon of modern human anxiety.

In late March, the Borgarting appeals court in Oslo found the three men 
guilty of helping the armed robbers, and acquitted three others.

"There has to be a sharp reaction to such a serious crime," the court 
said during sentencing, describing the paintings as "two of the 
cornerstones of Munch's production." Police also suspect that the 
robbery was organized to draw police resources away from a 2004 bank 
robbery in which a police officer was killed.

Petter Tharaldsen, 35, was sentenced to nine-and-a-half years in prison 
for driving the getaway car that spirited off the paintings and robbers. 
His term also included a sentence for an unrelated robbery.

Bjoern Hoen, 39, convicted of masterminding the theft, was sentenced to 
nine years for grand theft. Tharaldsen and Hoen were also convicted of 
being part of an organized crime group.

Stian Skjold, 31, was sentenced to five and a half years as one of the 
two gunmen who raided the Munch Museum. The second suspected gunman died 
in November before charges were brought against him.

"I will advise my client to appeal. The sentence is much too long," 
Morten Furuholmen, who defended Skjold, was quoted as telling the 
Norwegian news agency NTB. The other two defense lawyers and the 
prosecution said they would review the ruling before deciding on appeals.

Prosecutor Elisabeth Ramstad said she was satisfied that the court had 
completely accepted her description of the suspects roles and other 
facts in the case.

Police have refused to say how they recovered the paintings, which 
suffered scrapes, holes, loose paint and moisture damage. The museum is 
considering using an eye-surgeon to remove tiny fragments of glass 
embedded in the works after their frames were broken.

Munch's emotionally charged painting style became a major influence in 
the birth of the 20th-century expressionist movement. Munch died in 1944 
at the age of 80.

    *Man held for stealing painting from sister *

/Rustom Mehta allegedly took the Rs 60-lakh Jehangir Sabavala painting 
from his sister?s residence /

*Mumbai, April 23:* Rustom Mehta (57), a Pune based businessman was 
arrested by the Gamdevi police on Saturday for allegedly stealing a 
painting worth over Rs 60 lakh from his sister's residence at Kemps 
corner. The painting is by renowned artist Jehangir Sabavala.

?Mehta's sister Mehar Devis (50) is an acupuncturist residing at Raj 
Mahal building at Kemps Corner. Her husband and daughter live in Europe. 
Whenever Mehta is in town, he stays with his sister. On March 26, Devis 
lodged a complaint at the Gamdevi police station stating that her 
brother had stolen the Sabavala painting from her house. After 
conducting inquiries, we registered an offence of theft against Mehta on 
April 16,? said Police Inspector Shyam Parulekar of the Gamdevi police 
station, who is the investigating officer in the case.

According to the police, Mehta took the painting from his sister's house 
on March 3. He kept it at a friend's house before leaving on a business 
trip to Bangkok. In a note to his sister, he said he had taken the 
painting as their mother Tehami Mehta had left it to him in her will.

?The will was drafted in 1992, and it stated that the painting above the 
sideboard in the living room was to be given to Rustom Mehta. According 
to Devis, when their mother died in 1993, Mehta took the concerned 
painting, which was by another artist. A written agreement was also 
signed by the two siblings on this matter. The complainant later shifted 
the Sabavala painting from the verandah to the same spot above the 
sideboard,? said Parulekar.

A servant working at the Devis residence told the police that he saw 
Mehta remove the agreement signed by the two siblings from a rack near 
the sideboard. The Gamdevi police issued a lookout notice for Mehta to 
immigration authorities at Sahar airport and Mehta was arrested when he 
returned on Saturday. He was produced at the Girgaum Metropolitan 
Magistrates Court on Sunday and released on bail. The court has directed 
the police to keep the painting in its custody till the dispute is 
resolved.

When contacted, Mehta's lawyer Satish Maneshinde said, ? The matter did 
not require the police to issue a lookout notice as my client had 
assured them that he would submit the painting after his return. The 
ownership of the painting cannot be decided by the police as the will 
has not been probated yet. Also, my client has not signed any agreement 
regarding the painting.?

      Four on fake statue charge

23/ 4/2007

FOUR family members - two in their 80s - have been charged over the sale 
of a fake Egyptian statue once thought to be worth ?1m.

The Amarna Princess, said to represent King Tutankhamun's sister, was 
thought to be about 3,300 years old.

It was bought by Bolton council for ?440,000 in September 2003.

However, experts last year declared the 20in sculpture a fake.

Officers from the Metropolitan Police's Art and Antiques Unit removed 
the statue last March after concerns were raised about a Syrian 
sculpture which had arrived at the British Museum in London.

Police have now charged George Greenhalgh, 84, Olive Greenhalgh, 82, and 
their sons, George Jnr, 52, and Shaun, in his 40s, over the sale of fake 
antiques.

All four live together in The Crescent, Bromley Cross, Bolton. An 
anonymous seller claimed their great grandfather had bought the statue 
from an earl in 1892 and had taken it to his Bolton home.

The private collector expressed a wish for the Amarna Princess to return 
to the town.

Only two similar pieces are thought to exist - one in the Louvre and the 
other in a museum in Philadelphia.

The council paid for the `bargain' with the help of ?360,000 from the 
National Heritage Memorial Fund, ?75,000 from the National Art 
Collections Fund and ?2,500 from the Friends of Bolton Museum and Art 
Gallery.

The statue went on display in the town's museum after being featured at 
a London exhibition opened by the Queen. George Greenhalgh, the father, 
Olive Greenhalgh and Shaun Greenhalgh are accused of conspiracy to 
defraud, including allegedly selling faked and forged works of arts as 
genuine between 1989 and 2006.

They are also charged with money laundering fake arts and antiques and 
the proceeds of the sales from the antiques. George Greenhalgh senior 
and Shaun Greenhalgh face an additional charge of laundering the 
proceeds of the sale of the Princess.

George Greenhalgh, the son, is charged with money laundering fake arts 
and antiques and the proceeds of the sales from the antiques.

The four are due to appear before Bolton magistrates on Thursday.
