Following up on Frank's thought, why is it that parametric tests are so
much more popular than their non-parametric counterparts?  As
non-parametric tests require fewer assumptions, why aren't they the
default?  The relative efficiency of the Wilcoxon test as compared to the
t-test is 0.955, and yet I still see t-tests in the medical literature all
the time.  Granted, the Wilcoxon still requires the assumption of symmetry
(I'm curious as to why the Wilcoxon is often used when asymmetry is
suspected, since the Wilcoxon assumes symmetry), but that's less stringent
than requiring normally distributed data.  In a similar vein, one usually
sees the mean and standard deviation reported as summary statistics for a
continuous variable - these are not very informative unless you assume the
variable is normally distributed.  However, clinicians often insist that I
included these figures in reports.

I beg to differ Joseph.  I have had many datasets in which the CLT was
of no use whatsoever, i.e., where bootstrap confidence limits were
asymmetric because the data were so skewed, and where symmetric
normality-based confidence intervals had bad coverage in both tails
(though correct on the average).  I see this the opposite way:
nonparametric tests works fine if normality holds.

Note that the CLT helps with type I error but not so much with type II
error.
