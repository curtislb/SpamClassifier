I acknowledge that it's tricky, but I think we should try and draft a
template which is good, but, at the same time, not too far away from
what is needed for Debian (otherwise we will create a template that will
be heavily modified for the Debian case, which is really suboptimal at
best...).=20

As I said above, a template which is not too distant from Debian needs.
So maybe, the template could be suitable for those who like to clarify
the meaning of their logos.  Anyone who prefers to avoid specifying
that, can just drop the "representing [Z]" part, right?

Mmmh, the Debian Official Use Logo implies endorsement by the Debian
Project.
This is currently the case, and I think the Debian Project wants to keep
that feature (again, IANADD, opinions of actual DDs welcome).
Hence, if someone places the Official Use Logo on his/her products and
sells them, he/she is asserting that those products are endorsed by the
Debian Project: if they are not actually endorsed, he/she is misusing
the logo.

Or not?

To use them as long as there's no confusion going on.
If a logo means endorsement, you cannot use it on non endorsed products.
But you should be able to apply it to endorsed products (if, for
instance, you sell official Debian CDs and DVDs, I think you should be
allowed to apply the Official Use Logo on them).

Ah, that's OK, thanks for the clarification.
