Yes, I've just fixed it.  It's harmless.

I haven't released eSpeak 1.26 yet.  You must have got it from the
development page :-)

The problem was only that I didn't re-compile the phoneme data after i
changed the version number in the program code, so it thought the data
was for the wrong version of eSpeak.

The SourceForge  file release system seems to be not working at the
moment (unless I'm doing something wrong).

BTW, I've improved the German spelling-to-phoneme rules, but there's
still a long way to go!
