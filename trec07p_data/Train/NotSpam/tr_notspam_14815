Export of under patent medicine by Bangladeshi pharmaceutical industries.

Would anybody of this mailing list take the trouble to reply to the following
queries? We need this information to develop a proposal explaining the
opportunity of Bangladeshi pharmaceutical industries to export under patent
medicine to other LDCs or developing countries.

We will be highly obliged, if anyone please answer the queries with some
explanation, analysis and suggested references.

1. Can Bangladesh as an LDC, produce and export medicines (to LDCs or Developing
countries or all countries) until 2016 that are still under patent without any
royalties or any agreement with the patent holder?

2. Does the importing country, if an LDC; needs to issue any license (voluntary
or compulsory) or negotiation with the patent holder?

3. Does the importing country, if NOT an LDC; needs to issue any license
(voluntary or compulsory) or negotiation with the patent holder?

4. Can Bangladeshi pharmaceutical industries utilize (import) raw materials of
under patent medicines procured from any developing countries (like India or
China) for export purpose?

Looking forward to hear from you.
With sincere regards,
