Darn it.  I came in too late on this subject to make any sense out of  
it.
But I have a similar issue that I ran into and I'm wondering if you  
might be able to shed some light on it -- like am I going in the  
right direction.

I have a bayesian spam filter that I wrote in perl and have been  
developing into something useful for about a month now.
The features that make it different from SA is it's speed and the  
overall approach of managing tokens and data.
So far it's extremely fast but I suspect I will lost most or all of  
that in the near future.

The problem that I have run into a little bit is how to parse tokens  
with non-ascii text.

Example
I want to break up every email based on a token defined as /(\w\w\w+)/g;
This will give me every "word" of three or more letters.

But when I'm getting mail that is in UTF-8 format this doesn't work  
that way I want it to as I can't see an umlat (or similar) as  
matching a '\w'.

My data storage can handle these characters, but I can't.

Any suggestions?
(not sure how SA does this either)

Someone suggested 'use encoding "utf8"' but I actually couldn't find  
much on that either.
So this seems to be a good list to ask these sort of questions.
