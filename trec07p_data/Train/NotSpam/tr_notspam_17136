[0]E. Stride writes "Many IT managers find Security Enhanced Linux, or
SELinux, to be wildly complex. The mandatory access controls originally
developed by the NSA have developed a reputation for being too

However, Red Hat's Dan Walsh says it's the [1]only way to ensure 100%
protection in the data center."

turnitover sends us to eWEEK for an appreciation of the Apple II on the
30th anniversary of its shipping. An [0]overview of the history of the
Apple II puts it in context. A nice tidbit: how important the floppy
drive was to sales. The article quotes Sellam Ismail, the proprietor of
VintageTech, which maintains archives of computers, documents, and
software: "You could think of the Apple II's importance on two levels —
the Woz level and the Steve Jobs level." The former refers to its allure
to hackers, and the latter to its appliance-like polish, a first for its
time, There is also an [1]interview with Woz, who says, "[A]t the start
there were no computers in the home — we had to make the word computer
compatible with homes."

Yet another Anonymous Coward writes to tell us about a piece up at the
NYTimes on the (lack of) [0]longevity of photos printed on inkjet
printers. As the article's title says, somewhat alarmingly, "It isn't
that images fade, it's that they can vanish." The problem is actually
more nuanced than this; it's that no-one has a reliable and standardized
way of testing inkjet prints for longevity. From the article: "The life
of color inkjet prints has also been hindered by the origins of the
technology, which was mainly intended for printing things like pie
charts, said Nils Miller, a scientist at Hewlett-Packard. 'The initial
emphasis was, how do we get bright colors on plain paper," Dr. Miller
said. "Permanence was not really on the radar screen yet.'"

Slashdot contributor [0]Bennett Haselton has written an essay on a subtle
privacy issue affecting many websites (including Slashdot!) He says
"Suppose your girlfriend called up Match.com and said, "I think my
boyfriend might be cheating on me. His e-mail address is joeblow - at -
aol - dot - com. Can you tell me if he's a member?" And Match.com phone
support told her, "Why, yes, he is a member. You'd better have a talk
with him." After you had gotten over the guilt of getting caught -- I
mean, the guilt of cheating -- would you not feel like Match.com had
violated your privacy by telling a third party that you were a member?"
Keep reading to see what he's getting at and to decide if and when it's a
problem.

registered the trademark two years prior to Microsoft's application,
planning to use the trademark for a new television channel, Télé Vista,
which was to be launched later this year. Apparently, Gildas believes
that Microsoft's 'hogging of the limelight' presents an 'obstacle to the
launch'. Gildas has not, however, registered the Vista trademark in
categories of activity 9 and 42, which cover software. With this in mind,
his case might be hard to prove."

great applications too but more on that later. It has some elegance to it

[0]Michael J. Ross writes "If a Web site needs to be developed as quickly
as possible, or it needs to support collaborative content, then usually
the best approach is to use a content management system (CMS). There are
many CMSs from which a Web developer could choose, including Drupal,
which is considered by many to be the most powerful, extensible, and
logically organized of them all. Installing Drupal and using it to create
a simple site, is fairly straightforward, in part due to its relatively
excellent documentation. For much of its existence, there has been far
less information available on how to extend a Drupal site with one's own
modules, themes, blocks, etc. That need is now met by a new book, Pro
Drupal Development." Read on for the rest of Michael's review.

A couple of days ago Microsoft labs released a demo of their new
[0]Photosynth software on the web. Photosynth allows the aggregation of
social picture networks (a la Flickr) into a completed image in addition
to allowing a level of depth to image browsing previously unavailable.
There is also a very impressive [1]video of the demo available.

[0]LazloHollyfeld writes "A New London Superior court judge this morning
granted a defense request seeking a [1]new trial for Julie Amero, the
former Norwich middle school substitute teacher convicted of exposing her
middle school students to Internet porn. Acting on a motion by Amero's
attorney, William Dow III, Judge Hillary Strackbein placed the case back
on a trial list. Amero had faced 40 years on the conviction of four
counts of risk of injury to a minor. State prosecutor David Smith
confirmed that further forensic examination at the state crime lab of
Amero's classroom computer revealed "some erroneous information was
presented during the trial. Amero and her defense team claimed she was
the victim of pop-up ads — something that was out of her control. Judge
Strackbein said because of the possibility of inaccurate facts, Amero was
"entitles to a new trial in the interest of justice." After the brief
court appearance, a smiling Amero stood next to her attorney. "I feel
very comfortable with the decision," Amero said. Dow commended the state
for investigating the case further. A new court date has yet to be
scheduled. Amero has reentered a not guilty plea."

[0]anik315 writes "Nature is reporting a major [1]breakthrough in
embryonic stem cell research. A straightforward procedure using mouse
fibroblasts harvested from the skin can be used to produce pluripotent
stem cells that can potentially become any other cell in the body. Not
only can Yamanaka's method use the most basic cells, it can be
accomplished with simple lab techniques. Possible applications of this
breakthrough are to check molecular changes in cells as certain
conditions develop. Stem cells produced using this procedure, however,
can not be use to safely to make genetically matched cells for
transplant."

[0]Caroline Matische writes "People are [1]willing to pay more to buy
items from online retailers who make their privacy policies clear, a new
Carnegie Mellon University study showed. People were more likely to buy
from online merchants with good privacy policies and were also willing to
pay about 60 cents extra on a $15 purchase when buying from a site with a
privacy policy they liked."
