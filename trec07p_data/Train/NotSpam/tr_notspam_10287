Those characters are meaningless. The many symbols in Perl 6 have very
distinct meanings, which makes them very powerful tools!

There is a reason that C programmers don't throw away their source code
after compiling it.

While in some companies, writing software is indeed a unidirectional
process, most companies that wish to survive have to maintain what they
wrote, and then you also have to read it.

Programming languages and spoken languages are both read by human
beings, so they should still be easily parsed by these creatures.

They typically have a line continuation character instead of a
semicolon, though. However, like the previous sentence, and this one
too, actually, sometimes there is a line break in between.

Again, written language can be a nice example, because if we had line \
continuation characters in here, it would suddenly look a lot \
different. Did you, while reading this, pause, just before "different"?
