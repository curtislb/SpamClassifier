GPO may sue US lobby firm*

/*Says advert about local Aids drug misleading*/

*APIRADEE TREERUTKUARKUL ACHARA ASHAYAGACHAT*

The Government Pharmaceutical Organisation (GPO), the manufacturer of
the local anti-Aids drug GPO-VIR, is considering suing USA for
Innovation for publishing advertisements containing misleading details
about the drug's efficacy and the country's move to override Aids drug
patents through compulsory licensing. Vichai Chokewiwat, chairman of the
GPO board, yesterday said he was in consultation with legal experts to
prepare lawsuits against the group which lobbies for US pharmaceutical
companies, in addition to the media that published the advertisement.

''We have to do something in response to such a provocative public
relations campaign.

''What USA for Innovation claimed in its advertisement is not true and
that damages the country,'' he said, adding that GPO-VIR's fact file,
including the latest study on drug resistance, would be sent to the
Foreign Affairs Ministry.

The full-page advertisement in English-language newspapers claimed that
GPO-VIR was an HIV treatment copy. Citing a study by Mahidol University,
it added that a high resistance rate of 39.6-58% was found among users.

Wasun Chantratita, chief of Mahidol University's virology and molecular
microbiology unit, said the advert that cited his study was only half-true.

He said the study on drug resistance was conducted in 2000 _ two years
before GPO-VIR even existed. It focused on three individual original
drugs _ Nevirapine, Lamivudine (3Tc) and Stavudine (d4T) _ not GPO-VIR.

GPO started to produce GPO-VIR, which combines Nevirapine, Lamivudine
and Stavudine, in 2002.

Sombat Tanprasertsuk, director of the Aids, Tuberculosis and
Sexually-Transmitted Diseases Bureau, said a study by Siriraj Hospital
in 2005 showed that the resistance rate to the anti-Aids drug after two
years of usage was 14.6%. But some HIV-positive people may have
experienced resistance to Nevirapine and so they have had to use the
second-line drug instead.

Statistics released by the Public Health Ministry show that some 500,000
people are living with HIV/Aids. Of the total, about 100,000 depend on
anti-Aids drugs.

It is expected that some 12,000 people will need the second-line drug
because of GPO-VIR resistance.

Ashley Wills, a former assistant US Trade Representative (USTR)
currently advising a law firm, said Thailand should cancel
''unnecessary'' compulsory licensing for the sake of good relations with
the US and American investors in the long run.

Overriding drug patents with compulsory licensing has affected
Thailand's reputation and the mechanism was used in the context of
reduced respect for intellectual property rights, which he said is key
to attracting foreign investment.

Thailand has been downgraded to the Priority Watch List not only because
of compulsory licensing but because of its overall disrespect for
intellectual property rights, Mr Wills added.

''I'm not concerned whether it is legal or not legal to override the
medical patents but the question is whether it is smart for Thailand or
not,'' he said, adding that reduced drug prices were a short-term gain
with long-term costs.

He cited the potential flight of foreign investors amid intense
competition worldwide and in the region.

The decision to apply compulsory licensing has increased tensions
between Thailand and the US that existed since the coup in September
last year, he said.

Mr Wills blamed the drug companies for not taking seriously discussions
and requests by the Public Health Ministry to ''review the prices
acutely and at an earlier point''.

But he criticised the Thai government for taking the step prematurely
before all negotiated means had been exhausted.

''The health ministry might feel the drug firms are too aggressive and
their prices are too expensive, but the perception by the American
private sector is shock. We think the measure should be the last resort
after an adequate and serious consultation,'' he said.

If Thailand was diluting standards as American investors feared, it
would destroy the incentives they need, he said.

But if Thailand stopped applying compulsory licensing, it would be
widely welcomed by the US and international community, he added.
