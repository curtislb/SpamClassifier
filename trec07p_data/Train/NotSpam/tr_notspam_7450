Subject: file lists and diffs?

I have been given a task of installing a piece of backup software, then tarring
up all of the associated files in order to automate the installation onto other
machines.  The only way I can think of doing this is to do an ls -l on / and
then doing a diff after the installation and manually adding those files to a
tar command.

What I'd rather do is automate this using perl.  gather a list of the files,
perform the installation, getting a list of the new files by way of a diff or
some such and adding all those files to a tar command or some such.

Has anyone done such a thing or know of a module I should look at to achieve this?

Mathew
