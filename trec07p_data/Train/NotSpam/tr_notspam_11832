Dear Cabot Wealth Advisory Reader,

If you've been following my commentary in Cabot Wealth Advisory in recent
months, then it will come as no surprise to you to learn that Chinese
stocks continue to be among the strongest in the world.

As a result, Cabot China & Emerging Markets Report remains the
top-performing investment letter over the past 12 months (according to the
Hulbert Financial Digest), with a gain of 29.9%.

Last year it was the top-performing advisory letter in the country, with a
gain of 76%!   And over the past three years it boasts a 19.98% annualized
return vs. 13.31% for the dividend-reinvested Wilshire 5000.

Over the next three years . . . who knows?  My bet is that Cabot China &
Emerging Markets Report will continue to beat the Wilshire simply because
it invests in faster-growing countries.

We all know the Chinese economy is screaming along at an incredible rate,
as productivity improves and millions of previously under-used citizens
find gainful employment.

But China is not alone.  While the U.S. struggles to grow at a 4% rate,
Brazil, Russia and India are all making up for lost time, and the best
stocks in these countries are soundly trouncing American stocks!

Check out these recent winners:

Ctrip.com, up 130%
Focus Media, up 91%
China Mobile, up 51%

Not all of the stocks recommended are high-risk stocks.  For example,
Cabot China & Emerging Markets Report recently recommended a Russian
telecom (call it the AT&T of Russia), a Russian food company and a
Brazilian energy company.

If your investments have been limited by a focus on American stocks, I
suggest you add a little spice to your portfolio by investing in China and
other fast-growing economies.

In the long run, the prospects for growth are much better in those
countries.  It's as simple as that.

So try it out today!  I've arranged a special offer for readers of Cabot
Wealth Advisory, and you can access it by clicking the link below.
