Large Shipment of Rare Paintings Reported Missing in Europe
*
Collection of Prominent Art Critic En Route to US Missing in Croatia

    ST. PETERSBURG, Fla., April 20 /PRNewswire/ -- A shipment of 67
Croatian Naive reverse glass paintings destined for the recently opened
Croatian Naive Art Gallery & Museum Collection in St. Petersburg, Florida,
was reported missing in the capitol city of Zagreb, Croatia yesterday. The
large wooden crate measuring approximately 100CM (36") square and weighing
210 Kilos (462 lbs.) was picked up from the packing company by FedEx in
Zagreb on April 11th and expected to arrive at its final destination in St.
Petersburg on Saturday, April 14th or sooner. Eleven paintings from the
personal collection of prominent Croatian art critic Marijan Spoljar were
the "heart" of the shipment. The remainder of the 67 paintings was from
about 12 of the most famous Croatian Naive artists alive today, many of
whom are considered Modern Masters. FedEx has been unable to locate the
crate in either Frankfurt or Paris, two possible first European stops for
shipments to the US. The Gallery is optimistic the shipment will simply
show up, but fears that it was stolen are creeping in as the 9th day
missing draws to a close.
    Croatian Naive Art is a genre of art begun in the late 1920s
predominantly by self-taught farmer artists where the artist paints in
reverse in oils on the back side of a normal piece of glass. The artist
must sign his signature first backwards so that when you view the finished
work from the front it reads properly. Details and foreground are also done
before anything else. Former communist suppression has kept this art form a
European phenomenon until now. Most Croatian Naive Artists have been
painting for 35-50 years and are internationally recognized as having taken
this art form to the highest level.

    India, Others, Step Up Antiquities Scrutiny

BY BRADLEY HOPE - Staff Reporter of the Sun
April 20, 2007

The Republic of India has stepped up its scrutiny of New York's 
international antiquities trade, a senior consulate official said during 
an interview this week.

Over the past three years, the consulate has forged a closer 
relationship with U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, and several 
investigations into smuggled antiquities are under way in the city, the 
deputy consul general of the consulate, A.R. Ghanashyam, said.

"There was a time when people in villages would not even contemplate 
that things like this, objects in temples, could sell in a New York 
market," Mr. Ghanashyam said. "Over the last years, with increased 
tourist traffic and globalization, pieces are disappearing."

A senior special agent at ICE, James McAndrew, said India is part of a 
group of countries, including Thailand and Peru, that is scrutinizing 
the antiquities trade to a higher degree than in the past. With the 
filing of high-profile cultural property claims recently involving 
Italy, Greece, and Egypt ? countries that have long been proactive about 
recovering antiquities they say were looted ? other countries are 
starting to test the waters for claims of their own, he said.

"The antiquities trade has turned a corner," Mr. McAndrew said. "In my 
mind, I see a domino effect. Sooner or later, I see other countries 
trying to model Italy's success at recovering artifacts."

On April 17, 2006, a stolen Vishnu statue worth about $30,000 was turned 
over by ICE to the Indian government. The 250-pound sandstone statue was 
taken from a temple in the city of Mandsaur in the Madhya Pradesh state 
of India sometime in 2000, according to published reports. Mr. McAndrew 
was able to trace the statue to a New York gallery owner, Namkha Dorjee, 
who voluntarily surrendered the object to the government. It was being 
stored in a warehouse in Queens.

No one was charged with a crime because the original smuggler was 
murdered in Afghanistan during the course of the investigation. He was 
allegedly involved with another smuggling operation there, Mr. McAndrew 
said.

Since that investigation began in 2003, Indian officials have 
increasingly issued alerts about objects that may be heading to New 
York, which is one of the largest markets for antiquities collectors in 
the world, Mr. McAndrew said.

Mr. Ghanshyam said discussions were ongoing in India about how to better 
secure artifacts in remote villages, some of which had never been 
documented. It is virtually impossible to legally export an ancient 
object from India because permits to do so are never issued, he said.

Customs officials there are starting to use new technology to monitor 
outgoing shipments, and legislators are considering increasing the 
penalties for smuggling antiquities by amending the Antiquities and Art 
Treasures Act of 1972, Mr. Ghanashyam said.

Two New York gallery owners interviewed yesterday said they believe 
antiquities should be better protected in their home countries, but that 
the laws shouldn't restrict trade of antiquities altogether.

"There is a lot of good to this," the co-owner of E&J Frankel, Joel 
Frankel, said. "But, I'm still one of the old believers that sometimes 
when you make rules and laws too tight, nothing gets out, and the rest 
of the world doesn't have any idea of what material that country produces."

Mr. Frankel said he regularly turns away people who come to his gallery 
with objects that have unreliable histories, but that some collectors 
are willing to turn a blind eye.

Another gallery owner, Joseph Gerena, said: "So far the thrust of it has 
been overdramatized to demonize the collectors, museums, and dealers." 
The world is in danger of the "balkanization of culture" if pieces are 
horded in the countries from which they originate, he said.

Advocates of restricting the antiquities trade say the private market 
for ancient artifacts drives improper excavation around the world. The 
works can be damaged or slip from smuggler to collector without having 
ever been seen by an archaeologist or art historian, they say.

Crooks steal treasured family heirloom

A MUCH-loved family heirloom was stolen from a house in New Road, Lewes.
Burglars took five pictures from the home of retired University of 
Sussex reader Stephen Medcalf, 70, including a painting of his great 
great grandfather, John Richard Ellis.

The painting dates back to the 1830s and is of great sentimental value 
to Mr Medcalf, who had the artwork restored in the 1970s.

He said: 'It came into my family in the 1930s but my eldest brother put 
a dart through the mouth of the painting, so for quite a few years
it was languishing at the bottom of a cupboard until I had it restored 
in the 70s.'

Mr Medcalf believes the painting, which still has slight damage to the 
mouth, is worth only about ?100 but on a personal level is worth 
considerably more.

He said Ellis had been an innkeeper at the Old Punch House Inn in Ware, 
Herts.

After visiting the pub Mr Medcalf found out Ellis's great great 
grandfather was a distinguished figure in Ware and in 1832 a banquet was 
held to celebrate the passing of the Reform Bill, when Ellis presided 
over one of the tables.

The painting was stolen from Mr Medcalf's house on the evening of March 17.

A number of other works of art were taken, including a watercolour by 
William Bennett and a print of Merton College, Oxford, by David Loggan.

If readers any information about these paintings contact the police on 
0845 6070999, or Mr Medcalf on 0780 7465458.

Italians seek return of chariot from U.S.

ROME April 20 (UPI) -- About 100 residents of Monteleone, Italy, 
protested in Rome Friday, demanding the return of an ancient chariot 
that is on display in a U.S. museum.

"It's us, it's us, we're the owners of the chariot," they chanted 
outside the cultural ministry, as the Etruscan chariot was displayed at 
the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, Italian new agency ANSA 
reported Friday.

The museum said it owned the chariot for 100 years.

Monteleone Mayor Nando Durastanti tried unsuccessfully to meet with 
Culture Minister Francesco Rutelli. He has enlisted the help of 
Hamilton, N.J., Mayor Glen Gilmore, who wrote a letter to New Jersey's 
two Democratic U.S. Senators, Frank Lautenberg and Robert Menendez.

Adriana Emiliozzi of the Italian National Research Council, who worked 
on the chariot for the museum, said restorers at first thought the 
chariot was a provincial model but realized later "it was an absolute 
masterpiece," Emiliozzi said.

The chariot, about 2,600 years old, has a controversial past. It was 
unearthed in 1902 by a local farmer, sold for two cows, and allegedly 
dismantled and smuggled out of Italy.

The villagers Monday plan to present a book, "La Biga Rapita," at nearby 
Prugia. Translation: "The Stolen Chariot."

Met's art theft squad has to go cap in hand

? Budget cut leads to vain quest for private backers
? Specialist unit accorded 'very low priority'

Sandra Laville , crime correspondent
Saturday April 21, 2007
The Guardian

The dramatic scaling down of Scotland Yard's once renowned arts and 
antique squad has left organised criminals free to plunder the nation's 
heritage, according to a leading fine art insurer.

Police have sought private money to finance the squad after its annual 
budget of some ?300,000 was halved earlier this year. But the Guardian 
has learned that Scotland Yard has failed to secure a penny from 
insurers or auction houses, after months of discussions.

Britain's art market is second only to the US and experts claim up to 
?200m worth of stolen art and antiques are sold in the UK each year. 
Interpol estimates that art theft is the fourth largest organised crime 
after drugs, people trafficking and arms.

Annabel Fell-Clark, chief executive of Axa Art UK, which pays out tens 
of millions of pounds a year to reimburse victims of art theft, 
condemned the slashing of the unit's budget. She warned that scaling 
down the unit was already having an impact on pursuing art thieves who 
target Britain's stately homes and museums.

"We have seen that they [the team] are increasingly overstretched and 
being treated as a very low priority. At the moment we have very good 
information which we are wanting to pass on, which would bring arrests, 
if not convictions. But we are not being treated particularly seriously, 
let's put it that way.

"We want to see criminal gangs brought to justice, and in some instances 
lack of interest from the squad has stopped us being able to pursue 
further recovery. We want and need to work with the police."

She said Axa was aware the government was seeking funding for the squad 
but the company had decided it would not consider paying directly for 
the unit, adding that attempts by the Home Office and the Metropolitan 
Police to find private sponsors in the art world were shortsighted.

"It would be a conflict of interest for us to get involved," she said. 
"We have slightly different agendas. As insurers, we are interested in 
recovering the pieces however we can, and are not that bothered about 
finding and prosecuting the perpetrators. We are concerned that this 
aspect of law enforcement is not taken particularly seriously right now.

"Very often when you are investigating art theft connections are 
uncovered with organised crime in relation to drugs and arms dealing, so 
it doesn't make sense to ignore this aspect of criminal activity."

The London based "arts squad" was formed in 1969 to pursue and prosecute 
criminals who operate in the second biggest art market in the world. In 
the past the unit, which is called in to investigate 120 cases a year, 
was involved in recovery of art works across the world.

According to art crime sources, officers from the squad worked with 
Spanish investigators to help crack one of Europe's most spectacular art 
robberies - the theft of 19 paintings valued at ?30m from the Madrid 
penthouse of Esther Koplowitz, Marquesa of Casa Penalver and Cardenas.

Other successes include the uncovering of a multimillion pound British 
smuggling operation in which precious antiquities and archaeological 
artefacts were stolen from Egypt, some of which were sold at Sotheby's.

Last year the unit arrested a gang allegedly responsible for stealing 
tens of millions of pounds of art and antiques from stately homes over 
four years, including ?30m worth of antiques from Ramsbury Manor in 
Wiltshire.

Mark Dodgson, of the British Antique Dealers Association, said: "The 
idea of people in the art world funding the squad seems wrong. My 
members pay taxes already, and surely paying for the police is what 
their taxes are for."

Scotland Yard confirmed that as yet no private investors had been 
identified to provide the 50% funding required for the unit by the next 
financial year.

    Jail for obsessive collector who stole museum exhibits

///20th April 2007, 14:15 WST
/

It was the biggest museum theft in the nation's history, with more than 
2,000 specimens, including a skull from the now-extinct Tasmanian tiger, 
stolen from Sydney's Australian Museum.   

Former museum pest controller Hendrikus van Leeuwen, convicted of the 
theft, was today jailed for up to seven years for what a judge described 
as "enormous, incalculable harm".   

"Through his selfish actions he has cost the Australian Museum not only 
a great deal of money, but damaged its reputation," District Court Judge 
Peter Berman said in sentencing Leeuwen.   

" ... perhaps most importantly of all, (he has) caused permanent harm to 
the ability of scientists to study many aspects of the natural history 
of Australia and the rest of the world."   

Van Leeuwen, 50, began collecting bird and animal specimens, including 
road-kill, as a boy in Holland, the court was told.   

But his interest became an obsession, costing him his job and, 
ultimately, his freedom.   

Soon after he was hired in 1996, van Leeuwen began stealing specimens 
from the Australian Museum whose natural history collection - the oldest 
in the country - dates back to 1827.   

Van Leeuwen was "not a very good pest controller", according to one 
witness.   

But he was a very successful thief.   

His haul included skulls, skins and skeletons from animals such as the 
Ganges River dolphin, the clouded leopard and the rare Bulmer's Fruit 
Bat.   

Van Leeuwen was sacked in 2003 after the Independent Commission Against 
Corruption recovered more than 2,000 specimens in raids at his 
Londonderry home, in Sydney's west.   

The 2007 Australian of the Year, scientist and author Tim Flannery, gave 
evidence, saying he believed it was "the largest theft of museum 
holdings every perpetrated in Australia".   

Some items were irreparably damaged, the court was told.   

Some exhibits had their identifying numbers removed while others were 
bleached or, like the Tasmanian tiger skull, had teeth removed.   

Judge Berman rejected van Leeuwen's claim that he took the exhibits to 
protect them, finding he was "obsessed" with collecting specimens and 
simply wanted to possess them.   

Many of the exhibits - valued at more than $875,000 - were "unique and 
irreplaceable", the judge said.   

Van Leeuwen pleaded guilty to 15 counts of stealing from his employer, 
while Judge Berman took another 179 offences into account in sentencing.   

The charges were representative of more than 2,000 stolen items, the 
museum said.   

Australian Museum Trust president Brian Sherman said the impact of the 
theft on museum staff and the community, and the scale of the losses, 
was "incalculable".   

"Such a betrayal of trust is always regrettable, but when such 
deliberate and discriminating thefts compromise the work of hundreds of 
researchers conducted over centuries, it is particularly heartbreaking 
for our loyal staff," he said.   

"The community is also deprived of the knowledge and experience 
represented by these specimens."   

Van Leeuwen must serve at least five years behind bars and will be 
eligible for parole in 2012.
