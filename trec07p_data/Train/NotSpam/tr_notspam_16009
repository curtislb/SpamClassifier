It is a freedom that I have by default; if I accept the CDDL I no longer
have that freedom[1].  Therefore it is a freedom that I'm giving up.

No.  The GPL grants certain additional, limited rights without taking away
any rights that I already have.  The CDDL grants certain additional, limited
rights *in exchange for* me giving up a right that I have.

Great, I'll start working on the Indentured Servitude Public License; I
trust I can count on your support when it comes time for NEW processing.

[1] Technically, not the right to "choose a venue", but the right to not be
sued in a venue where I have no legal presence.
