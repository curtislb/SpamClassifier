Summary: Programmatic Way to Upload content to ccHost

Initial Comment:
While one could just use standard HTTP GET/POST and the
current interface for getting content into ccHost, it
would be nice to have some easy-to-use virtual
filesystem (VFS) or the like system to be able to get
standard save and open in operating systems. The
portland project is working to make a cross-GNOME+KDE
system: 

http://www.scheinwelt.at/~norbertf/dadapt/files/xdg_utils/doc/libxdg-vfs.html

The question is what type of module will allow us to
get access to ccHost? WebDAV or another?

This is a high priority for being able to get content
shuttled directly from the desktop to an installation
and I think would get a lot of people who would like to
switch up to ccHost.

Yes, true...I believe that the standard GTK/GTKMM dialogs allow this. Yes,
I just tested this in GNOME with GEdit and it works fine with the following
test setup.

Also, I tested with this test webdav setup by Greg Stein:

WebDAV would make sense since you already have a dependency
on Apache.  It's also fairly cross-platform, and (I think)
would work ok via gnome-vfs and other vfs tools.

There might be FUSE-based options out there, but I've only
had limited experience with FUSE.

Most other options I know of are either going to be
challenging to set up, too slow, or too platform-specific.

One thing to think about is in addition to desktop ->
ccHost, of providing ccHost -> desktop functionality.  It'd
be useful to be able to have a bunch of desktops that
automatically update from the ccHost server automatically. 
There's several ways to solve it (rsync's, svn, etc.) but if
it can be done with the same approach as uploading, then you
kill two birds with one stone.  ;-)
