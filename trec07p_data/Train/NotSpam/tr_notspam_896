HEADLINES:
NORTH CAROLINA: 3 DUKE LACROSSE PLAYERS ARE “INNOCENT”
Today, North Carolina's attorney general said the three former Duke University lacrosse players who faced sexual assault charges are “innocent,” and there is no credible evidence to support the accusations.  "We believe these three individuals are innocent of these charges," Attorney General Roy Cooper said. The state is dismissing all charges, he said.  Cooper said no more criminal proceedings will occur.  And he blasted the handling of the case by the Durham County district attorney’s office, saying there were major gaps in the evidence and the accusations.  Cooper said there is no evidence to suggest an attack occurred.

DEFENSE SECRETARY GATES ORDERS 15-MONTH TOURS FOR ARMY IN IRAQ
Many U.S. troops in Iraq, who thought they’d be leaving by a certain date, will now have to stay longer.  The Pentagon will extend the tours of duty for members of the U.S. Army in Iraq from 12 to 15 months.  Defense Secretary Robert Gates made the announcement today.  But Gates said the service will guarantee soldiers a year at home after deployment.

SEN. MCCAIN: DEMOCRATS ACCEPTING DEFEAT IN IRAQ
Republican presidential hopeful John McCain is lashing out at Democratic demands for a U.S. withdrawal from Iraq.  Yesterday, the Arizona senator accused party leaders of seeking political advantage in an American defeat.  McCain, who made a highly publicized trip to Iraq two weeks ago, told cadets at Virginia Military Institute that Democratic leaders in Congress voted to begin pulling U.S. troops from Iraq in "giddy anticipation of the next election."  "Before I left for Iraq, I watched with regret as the House of Representatives voted to deny our troops the support necessary to carry out their new mission," he said. "Democratic leaders smiled and cheered as the last votes were counted. What were they celebrating? Defeat? Surrender? In Iraq, only our enemies were cheering."  Both the House and Senate have passed a $123 billion war-spending bill that President Bush has requested, but with demands that American combat troops leave Iraq in 2008.  Mister Bush has threatened to!
  veto the bill and said Democrats will take the blame for any shortfalls U.S. troops face during the political standoff.  Democrats say they are reflecting the views of the American people, who polls indicate have tired of the 4-year-old war.

FRED THOMPSON’S CANCER SLOW-GROWING, IN REMISSION: DOCTOR
A doctor for former Senator Fred Thompson announced today that the possible presidential candidate was diagnosed in 2004 with a form of lymphoma, a cancer that begins in cells of the immune system.  "Today, he is in remission from this slow-growing disease," said Doctor Bruce D. Cheson, head of hematology in the division of hematology/oncology at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington.  Cheson said that, of the more than 30 types of lymphoma that exist,
Thompson, 64, has an indolent form shared by about one in four people diagnosed with the disease.  "Some lymphomas are very aggressive, but people with slow-growing types, like Senator Thompson's, often die from natural causes associated with old age, rather than from the disease," he said.  “Using a standard prognostic scoring system, Senator Thompson's prognosis is favorable."  Cheson said the disease had never caused Thompson to become physically ill nor had he displayed any symptoms of the disease or suffered any side effects from therapy.  Thompson was treated with Rituxan, a chemotherapeutic agent, "but he is no longer in treatment since he is in remission," Cheson said.  A source familiar with Thompson's deliberations on whether to jump into the 2008 presidential race tells CNN that Thompson has been discussing his illness privately "for some time."  Asked how the illness might affect a possible presidential bid, the source said, "This disclosure should indicate to ev!
 eryone interested in seeing Fred enter the race for the White House how serious he is taking the next steps toward launching a campaign."  Thompson is a familiar face on television, where he has played the role as gruff district attorney Arthur Branch on NBC's three "Law & Order" series.

AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER NEEDED A BATHROOM BREAK.  SO 2 FLIGHTS HELD UP
Two Southwest Airlines flights were put into a holding pattern for 18 minutes -- and a plane on a Lifeguard flight mission ferrying human lungs was briefly delayed from taking off Friday -- because the lone air traffic controller on duty had to take a bathroom break, the controller's union said.  The union released details of the incident Tuesday citing it as evidence that air traffic control facilities are understaffed.  "There should never be one person in the tower because it's not safe," said Spie Church, spokesman for the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. "It's just added proof that the system is stretched to its limits and these are the type of things that are happening."  Federal Aviation Administration officials responded that staffing is sufficient, that the bathroom break was handled in accordance with policy, and that travelers were not endangered or unduly inconvenienced.  While drawing vastly different conclusions about the significance of the event,!
  the FAA and the union gave details that generally matched.  Both said that the controller, whom neither named, had been on duty at Manchester-Boston Regional Airport about two hours and 40 minutes when he had to take a bathroom break. Because the only other employee in the tower was not certified to handle take-offs and landings, the controller notified FAA's Boston consolidated terminal radar approach control, or TRACON, that he was taking the unscheduled break.   FAA spokesman Jim Peters said the controller, who had handled 60 aircraft during the first three hours of his shift, acted responsibly by waiting until a slow period before taking his bathroom break. Boston TRACON assumed responsibility for the airspace and placed two aircraft in a holding pattern until the controller returned.  Peters said the break lasted 12 minutes, but said a few additional minutes may have lapsed as the planes were realigned to land.
