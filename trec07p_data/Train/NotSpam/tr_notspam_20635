There's some discussion on reading license info in GStreamer, regarding CC's usage of WCOP in id3 tags.  I was hoping to have the WCOP tag recognized as a license.

The latest discussion:

You're probably right about the encoding, I read to quickly there.

I'm still a bit undecided about what to do here. I don't think it's technically
correct to map WCOP to GST_TAG_LICENSE, since the link might not link to a
license, and we also map TCOP to GST_TAG_COPYRIGHT, so IMHO we should map WCOP
also to GST_TAG_COPYRIGHT or introduce a new GST_TAG_COPYRIGHT_URI or so.

The W... frames seem rather useless and ill-specified as a whole, I wish
creative-commons had just decided to go for custom frames (TXXX and WXXX). But
since they've adopted the ill-specified ID3 scheme, there isn't much we can do
about that now, I guess.

What we could do (in addition to the above or in stead of the above) is to add
a helper function or two to libgsttag to recognise a set of white-listed
well-known license URIs and then set the GST_TAG_LICENSE* if we find one of
those. Not very elegant though.

Comments?
