Pt</B>

<B>EXPLOSIVE BRANGELINA FAMILY SECRETS!</B>
Showbiz Tonight uncovers the never-before-heard details of
Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's personal life. You will hear
Angelina in her own words talk about being a mom, spending time
with Brad and the kids, even how they make their sex life work!


<B>STARS AND PLASTIC SURGERY!</B>
Showbiz Tonight investigates star plastic surgery successes and
nightmares. We reveal whose nips and tucks were terrific and
whose were just plain terrible. The good, the bad, and the
sometimes very ugly side of plastic surgery!

<B>SHOULD SMOKING BE BANNED IN MOVIES?</B>
The movie industry will now start taking into account smoking
in movies when determining ratings. If there is too much
smoking that can't be justified by the plot, the movie will get
an "R" rating. Is this a good idea or are the p.c. police going
too far? The heated debate on TV's most provocative
entertainment news show.
