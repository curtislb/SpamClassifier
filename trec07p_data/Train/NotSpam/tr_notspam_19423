<p><span class=atitle><b>Describing the Indescribable--Just Back From Germany</b><br></span>
<p>
<p><img src="http://www.bookcrossing.com/images/Scott-headshot-138.jpg?date=4%2F24%2F2007+7%3A27%3A35+PM" align=left hspace=5>I just got back from the 
Frankfurt, Germany BookCrossing convention and it was simply indescribable (ok, I’ll give it a shot; when am I at a loss for words?) <p class=indent> <p>
<a href="http://www.bookcrossing.com/mybookshelf/Wyando">Wyando</a> and Team Frankfurt did an incredible job of coordinating this 96-hour extravaganza 
that was jam-packed with activities ranging from book exchanges, treasure hunts throughout the city of Frankfurt,  and of course a healthy dose of 
German beer! <p class=indent> BookCrossers came out in full force not only from Germany, but we had a massive contingent from several other countries 
including:  Austria, Ireland, The Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, England and Switzerland.  It was so great to finally put faces next to the screen 
names you see so frequently and some of the pictures can be located <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/337013@N25/pool/">here</a> for your viewing 
pleasure. <p class=indent> There were hundreds (if not close to a thousand) of books released, caught and journaled over the four-day event in places 
that are just amazing.  Personally, I picked up Ken Follett’s <a href="http://www.bookcrossing.com/journal/5111071"><i>Whiteout</a></i>, Mickey 
Spillane’s <a href="http://www.bookcrossing.com/journal/4712130"><i>The Flier</a></i>, Anita Diamant’s <a href="http://www.bookcrossing.com/journal/2820556">
<i>The Red Tent</a></i> (which I may create a BookRing for) and Frank McCourt’s <a href="http://www.bookcrossing.com/journal/5107622"><i>Angela’s 
Ashes</a></i>.  I also picked up a <a href="http://www.bookcrossing.com/journal/5112309">Fondue cookbook</a> written in German but that was after a 
7-hour dinner and drink with fellow BookCrossers: )  I also released about 25 books around the city and 
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/8432495@N03/509436370/">this one</a> was my favorite. <p class=indent>
On Sunday, we all got together for a fantastic book exchange brunch and we had a special guest star, 
<a href="http://www.bookcrossing.com/mybookshelf/cliff1976">Cliff1976</a>, of <a href="http://bcwish.cliff1976.net/">Cliff’s Wish List</a>.  He was 
met with a standing ovation and the BCers treated him like the rock star he is … I’m sure he got his fill of “feature requests” but I’m more than 
in touch with that emotion!  This is not a shy, reserved, or quiet group. <p class=indent> I want to thank all the BookCrossers at the Frankfurt 
convention for an incredible time.  Their hospitality, warmth, friendship and dedication to BookCrossing has my deepest appreciation and I’m bringing 
back with me all their requests in helping to make BookCrossing an even better community of book lovers worldwide. <p class=indent> <p>Best to all,<br> 
Scott<br>

<p>
<p><img src="http://i126.photobucket.com/albums/p116/bcnewsletter/1.jpg" align=left hspace=5>Colson Garrett Hornbaker joined the BookCrossing 
family at 12:53 p.m. on June 9, 2007. He weighed in at 8 pounds 2 ounces (3.68 kg), 20 inches (50.8 cm) long, has lots of dark hair, and is 
very healthy and handsome (so we're told).  He was welcomed to the world by his mother Kaori, father Ron (aka Reno, our BookCrossing Founder) 
and big sister Lydia.   <p class=indent> We thought the perfect way to welcome our next generation in the BookCrossing Family would be to suggest 
a release challenge.  So, we challenge BookCrossers around the world to release a book in Colson's honor to let him know he's got extended family 
and fans just about everywhere!  There is a thread over in <a href="http://www.bookcrossing.com/forum/23/4474828/1">Release Challenges</a> to keep 
track of your releases.  Let your imagination and creativity go wild. <i>Welcome Colson and CONGRATULATIONS to Ron, Kaori and Lydia!</i>

<p>
<p><img src="http://i126.photobucket.com/albums/p116/bcnewsletter/missouri_250x208.jpg"align=left hspace=5> Mark your calendars for some outdoor fun!  
The 2nd annual Midwest BC Family Camp-Out will be held July 20 &mdash; 22, at the Circle B Camp Ground in Eminence, Mo.  Primitive campers (i.e., 
those who are sleeping in tents or directly under the stars rather than sleeping in RVs, cabins or motels) need to R.S.V.P. before June 25 so that 
everyone can be in the same area. There are no registration fees being collected for the event.  Last year the folks attending had a blast.  Don't 
believe us?  Check out <a href="http://www.bookcrossing.com/articles/2350/They-survived-wild-releasing-in-the-wild">this article</a> by 
<a href="http://www.bookcrossing.com/mybookshelf/eireannaigh">eireannaigh</a> and see for yourself.  For more information click

and Tea Leaf</a> has always been passionate about serving their customers the best coffees and teas from around the world.  Now they are big on books, 
too.  BookCrossing is pleased to announce a new partnership with the 
<img src="http://i126.photobucket.com/albums/p116/bcnewsletter/bally.png"align=right hspace=5> Coffee Bean.  Starting this month, locations in 
California and Arizona will be piloting Official BookCrossing Zones and welcoming BookCrossers with open arms and a cup of some of the world's 
finest coffees and teas.  If you do not live in one  of our pilot locations, be sure to check out the Coffee Bean website and store for convenient 
online ordering  or to find one of the other hundreds of locations around the world.  If you’d like to have a store near you be considered for part 
of the trial, please email us at <i>cbtl AT bookcrossing DOT com</i>.  The Coffee Bean is also a certified Green restaurant so recycling books 
through BookCrossing is a great fit!

when you see the new BookCrossing widget available through <a href="http://www.widgetbox.com/widget/c2f78578-4513-4469-9e11-e7eb35dc6727">widgetbox</a>.  
We think it's great, but we might be a little biased as it was created by our very own <a href="http://www.bookcrossing.com/mybookshelf/Matt">Matt</a>.  
The widget (available for free, though a membership to widgetbox is required) shows either recently released or recently caught books from our BookCrossing 
site &mdash;  you can toggle between the two and keep up with the latest site happenings.  It works on TypePad, WordPress, Blogger, MySpace as well as most 
other blogs, sidebars or websites &mdash;  anything that allows JavaScript.  Like we said:  Wow!<BR><BR>

<p>
<p><img src="http://i126.photobucket.com/albums/p116/bcnewsletter/BallycumberFlagCircle-1.gif" align=left hspace=5>Okay, okay &mdash;  Here's what 
our <a href="http://www.bookcrossing.com/newscontent/441">International Label</a> says!  "I'm a very special book, traveling the world. See where I've 
been at www.bookcrossing.com, then read and release me!"  The languages represented are (in order of appearance on the label):  Spanish, Greek, German, 
Italian, Finnish, French, Portuguese, Dutch and Swedish.  And we'll let you in on a little secret.  We'll soon have a new T-shirt in the Supply Store chock 
full of international tag lines!  Woo Hoo!  <p class=indent> The other news is that the ever-increasing U.S. postage rates have forced us to no longer 
routinely offer free shipping.  The good news is that less than 5% of our orders qualified for this deal.  Unfortunately, those orders were mostly group 
orders which were large, heavy and bulky, thus also the most expensive for us to ship (which only compounded our dilemma.) We will continue to search for 
the absolute best shipping rate for getting  our merchandise quickly and efficiently to you.  We are in the process of evaluating several carriers to see 
which can provide the best domestic and international rates.  There are also plans to offer free shipping in the future as a periodic Manager's Special.  
We still encourage you to make group orders as the cost per individual is reduced when more people are sharing it. Stock up on supplies to get true value 
for your money; order less frequently but in larger quantities.  It will help to stretch your dollar, euro, pound, yen or whichever currency calls your 
wallet home.   While we regret having to alter our rates, we depend on supply store sales to maintain an always-and-forever-free site. We hope you 
understand and once again, thank you for your continued support!

<p>
<p><img src="http://i126.photobucket.com/albums/p116/bcnewsletter/ballyballoons2.jpg" align=left hspace=5>Big things are coming to Albuquerque, New Mexico 
this fall.  Hot Air Balloons &mdash; hundreds of them!  The 2007 Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta will be held from October 6 &mdash; 14, filling 
the sky with of hundreds of beautiful, bright, hot air balloons.  The ground will be full of over 800,000 visitors!  Local BookCrossers are working on 
ways to get some BookCrossing exposure at this event and are in the early stages of planning some events and meets during this time.  Why not come and 
see one of the most beautiful sights to 
behold, enjoy great food and entertainment, and meet up with other 
BookCrossers at the same time?  You can visit <a href="http://www.balloonfiesta.com/">www.balloonfiesta.com</a> for more information on the event and 
travel/lodging information. Wouldn't it be fun to have books released in a throng of 
hundreds of thousands of people from around the world?  Or even better, for some books to fly in hot air balloons, and get certified, signed stickers 
saying they flew and were released upon landing?  The more the merrier, so start making your plans to be in Albuquerque in October.  Can't make the 
trip, but would like to have some of your books involved? The Albuquerque BCers are now collecting books for the event, and will gladly add yours to 
the pile if you are interested in sending some.  Contact <a href="http://www.bookcrossing.com/mybookshelf/Jare">Jare</a>,

<span class=asubtitle>Promoting the convention on Charleston radio<br></span>
by <a href="http://www.bookcrossing.com/mybookshelf/ResQgeek"><b>ResQgeek</b></a></p>
<p>
Arriving in Charleston the day before the official start of the convention, I immediately proceeded to the broadcast studios for 
<a href="http://www.1055thebridge.com/content.asp">The Bridge (105.5 FM)</a>, where a group of BookCrossers had been invited for an on-air interview to 
promote BookCrossing and the Convention.  I was driving down with Skyring and we were running a bit late (no doubt because we took the scenic route and 
were releasing books along the way), but when we pulled up to the station we were met by a group of BookCrossers patiently waited for our arrival.  We 
headed inside and were greeted by our host and the station staff and then were directed upstairs to the broadcast booth....

<span class=asubtitle>No, really.  Trust me on this.<br></span>
by <a href="http://www.bookcrossing.com/mybookshelf/bookczuk"><b>bookczuk</b></a></p>
<p>
I was a very happy person before I found BookCrossing.  Honest.  Really.  (well, discount the fact that just immediately before finding BC I got a 
life-threatening illness and almost checked out of this life from it several times.  That <i>does </i> put a damper on things.)  But despite having to 
totally revamp how I lived my life, I was quite happy.  I have a wonderful family, filled with love and laughter and grace.  I had a fabulous career 
and a stellar reputation in my field, despite the fact that I was suddenly yanked from practicing because of that fricking occupationally acquired 
illness.  (Wait-- that sounds like there was some bitterness creeping in there.)  Okay, I'll admit it.  Latex allergy and the subsequent pulmonary 
problems I've had bite it big time, but still, my life then was, and is now, blessed.  Good.  Happy.  And all that stuff....

break! So the Trolls stayed at the Riverview hotel several days before and after the BC bash to see the city....

1500 cross-referenced characters, plot and place profiles, currency converters and quotes of the day.  ...

Released a copy of 1984 at the Pour House a few months ago, and got this catch (via an AF) today.  I get enough catches at the Pour House that I don't get as excited about them anymore (unless they're especially meaningful), but it seems as 
though very few of my books move on to the 2nd generation.  So I was very pleased about this one when I realized the AF had in fact, passed it on.  (Don't know who Adele is though, or where StJohn is.) <p>
