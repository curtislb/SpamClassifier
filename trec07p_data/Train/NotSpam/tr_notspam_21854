Several years ago, there were several versions of the Slackware
installer.  One of them lacked all of the menus, and it played very
nicely with speakup.  I believe the name of the program was
setup.tty.  Unfortunately, it seems to have disappeared.

The menu problem is caused by a little utility named "dialog", that
allows one to display dialogs within shell scripts.
I think it should be possible to hack dialog so that it displays menus
with numbered options, rather than cursor-selectable options.  Such
menus work well with screenreaders.  
Perhaps the dialog tool could number its options if an environment
variable were set.
Has anyone on the list given much thought to this problem?
