TONIGHT ON SHOWBIZ TONIGHT- CNN HEADLINE PRIME 11pm ET/ 11pm PT

<b>PARIS HILTON APPEALS!</b>
Paris Hilton's lawyers have taken the first steps toward appealing her 45-day jail sentence for violating her probation. Will she win? What about taking responsibility for her actions? And why is her publicist back at her side, after she blamed her legal troubles on him? All the latest, tonight on TV's most provocative entertainment news show.

<b>HASSELHOFF'S HASSLE</b>
A judge suspends David Hasselhoff's visitation rights with his children, after a videotape is released showing Hasselhoff drunk and incoherent. Did the judge make the decision? Plus, Hasselhoff's wife speaks out, in one of the nastiest divorce battles ever!

<b>SECRETS TO BEING A BIG STAR!</b>
Paris Hilton is the best example of "famous for nothing," so Showbiz Tonight has some advice for her -- the secrets of how to be a <i>real</i> star. How do celebrities like Angelina Jolie, George Clooney, and Nicole Kidman get on top and <i>stay</i> on top? The answer tonight, on Showbiz Tonight!

<b>SHOWBIZ TONIGHT QUESTION OF THE DAY:</b>
Hasselhoff loses visitation rights: Was it the right call?
