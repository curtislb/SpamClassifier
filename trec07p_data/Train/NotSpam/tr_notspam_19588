11 AM, 6/15/07, Update: Astronauts gear up for spacewalk=20

Editor's Note:
This status report will be updated after a news conference with space stati=
on program manager Mike Suffredini, who is expected to discuss the current =
status of the international lab complex and work to repair its crippled com=
puter system. The news conference, originally planned for 12:30 p.m., has b=
een delayed but should begin shortly. See the 7:17 a.m. status report for c=
omplete details.


The Atlantis astronauts were awakened around 8:30 a.m. to begin a busy day =
in orbit highlighted by an afternoon spacewalk to complete the retraction o=
f the P6-2B solar array and the impromptu repair of a pulled up insulation =
blanket on the shuttle's left-side maneuvering rocket pod.

Russian flight controllers, meanwhile, have told space station commander Fy=
odor Yurchikhin they don't plan any additional attempts today to restart th=
e Russian segment's computer system. After isolating the system from U.S. s=
olar array power, an attempt was made early today to activate the three-cha=
nnel navigation system and command-and-control computers. But the navigatio=
n system did not boot up and while one of the three channels, or "lanes," m=
aking up the central computer came to life, communications were not normal =
and power to all the computers was shut off one orbit later.

Some engineers had speculated that some subtle quirk in the electrical syst=
em feeding power from newly installed solar arrays to the Russian segment m=
ight have led to this week's problems. The German-built computers are known=
 to be susceptible to "noisy" circuits. But their behavior today in the abs=
ence of U.S. power was similar to what was observed earlier in the week. En=
gineers are continuing to assess the situation.

Today's spacewalk, the third of four excursions planned by the Atlantis ast=
ronauts, is highlighted by work to repair the insulation blanket and finish=
 the retraction of the P6-2B solar array. The P6 array was attached to the =
station in 2000 to provide power during the early stages of assembly. Now, =
NASA needs to move it to the left end of the station's main power truss to =
prepare the complex for the delivery of European and Japanese resarch modul=
es later this year and early next.

During retraction of the P6-4B array last December, the astronauts ran into=
 major problems and ultimately had to stage an unplanned spacewalk to fold =
the blankets back in their storage boxes. This time around, the Atlantis as=
tronauts have taken a more deliberate, step-by-step approach, retracting th=
e array about 28 feet before a spacewalk Wednesday in which Pat Forrester a=
nd Steve Swanson manually cleared hangups and ultimately got the 115-foot-l=
ong array in about half way.

Today, Reilly and Olivas plan to finish the job, although time is available=
 in a fourth spacewalk Sunday if they run into any major problems.

As for the pulled-up insulation blanket, Olivas, working on the end of the =
shuttle's 50-foot-long robot arm, plans to push the bent-up corner down flu=
sh and use a surgical stapler to secure its edges to adjacent blankets. He =
also will use steel thread to anchor the blanket in an adjacent row of heat=
-shield tiles. The work is fairly straight forward as such things go and mi=
ssion managers are optimistic the repair will stand up to the rigors of re-=
entry when temperatures on the upper part of the shuttle can reach 1,000 de=
grees.

Here is a timeline of today's activities (in EDT and mission elapsed time; =
includes rev. I of the NASA TV schedule):
