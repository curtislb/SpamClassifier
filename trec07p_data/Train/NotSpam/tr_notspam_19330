Greg,

This is very interesting.  Perhaps something similar could be worked out
here.  Do you have to get MS Word users to work only with the template you
provide, or can they provide you any old MS Word document?

But sweave is expanding.  There is a driver for HTML sweaving in the
R2HTML package and the odfWeave package allows you to sweave with open
office docs (which can be converted to/from MS word).  I personally like
using LaTeX and the original sweave, but I work with people who want
everything in MS word or similar, so for them I will create a template
file in open office, odfWeave that, convert to MS word and send that to
them.

I think the offset is more that S-PLUS 8 is supposed to implement many
of the things that R does now (I don't know which, I'm waiting for my
copy of 8), so soon it may be possible to sweave in both.
