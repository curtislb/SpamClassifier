Hi everyone,

I am working with perl 5.8 at the moment after developping web apps in PHP.
 
I know that perl doesn't only focus on web apps and my question might 
seem irrelevant
but I've been searching the web in order to find the new features of 
perl6 regarding
new functions, core module lists (not perl grammar itself) but couldn't 
find any thing...

I would like to develop web apps with perl too but having to download 
modules from CPAN
every time makes me feel these apps will never be able to evoluate in 
different environments.
(environments you don't have control of)

I am a bit amazing to see that perl doesn't include a bunch a set theory 
functions too.
Instead, need to reinvent the wheel making things easy possible and hard 
things unconvenient.

I am not blaming perl but only hopes that perl6 will allow to make 
things easy for the programmer.

as for the web, maintaining state thru server side cookies and DBI are 
the very minimum I would recommend.
more hash and array functions a minimum too.
if there are such things in perl6, I'll be very happy to work with this 
language !


I may not know enough about perl and my 'complain' might be absolutely 
unfounded.
I know this is an open source language and that people are busy and if 
the answer is "DIY !"
I'll pass my way^^;

Anyway, this is an outside view from 2007 hoping to help perl6 becoming 
popular amongst people.
