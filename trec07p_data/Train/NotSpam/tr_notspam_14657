It seems to me that the first item is only half an item: the compiler
also has to assume that evaluating the function has no side effects, or
at least is idempotent in that the side effects only happen the first
time you call it on a given Capture. Actually, that distinction raises
another point in my mind: will there be a way to distinguish pure
functions with no side-effects at all, which if called on constants are
candidates for being hoisted into BEGIN blocks, from merely idempotent
subs, which must not be called until runtime but can be memoized?

Even if there is such a distinction, and it is covered elsewhere
(reading Synopsis diffs spaghettifies them in my mind, I'm afraid), I
think the difference should be mentioned here.
