I don't remember it breaking win32. As I remember it, it was committed
the day before 0.4.10 , which wasn't appropriate for a patch like this.

If there are win32 issues I would really like to know about them so
I can resolve them. This patch should not change existing behavior
at all. It adds a bit of infrastructure so that more flexible behavior
can be easily built on top of it later.

It is a "new feature" , but from my point of view it is a incremental
towards a bug fix. What sort of format/extension a parrot file will
have is entirely random; this includes critical pieces such as the runtime=
=20
library, making use of basic facilities difficult.

I want to break the hardwiring of the format (.pir|.pbc) when a module=20
is loaded. Once the loader figures out the format loaded instead of=20
hard-coding it all over the parrot tree, then something can be done=20
about normalizing the standard library. ".load_bytecode" would also be more
like perl "use" instead of perl "do" .

With patch 5 #41908 the extension is still hardcoded, just inside parrot
instead of all throughout the parrot source tree. Currently the first
open attempted is with the name as-given , so it implements past/current
parrot behavior.

Sane behavior for selecting the  right format when there are multiple forma=
ts=20
for the same source was proposed as PARROT_LOAD_PREFER.

I have authored a couple of lengthy messages hashing out these issues.
I was stalled due to time for a few weeks , but I have dropped enough
items off my open-source TODO to take a crack at this again.
