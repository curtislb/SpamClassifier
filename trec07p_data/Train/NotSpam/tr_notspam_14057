   Trying to leverage all the attention that the media gives Facebook, I 
have created a 'wish' that I hope everyone here can support.  It might get 
us some additional media attention, and possibly some additional 
signatures/etc.

   I am wondering what other people are doing to try to keep attention on 
this issue?  We may see a bill tabled soon, and want to ensure that as 
many people as possible know about the real issues we are trying to 
discuss.
