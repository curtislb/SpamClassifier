Hi
I don't doubt that the 32-bit code would run under 64-bit Linux with  
the correct emulation libraries, it usually does. However, there are  
other issues to take into account other than whether it runs. The  
main one is that 64-bit and 32-bit libraries often are unable to link  
together. Have you been able to run it with a fully 64-bit gnome and  
gnome-speech installation linked into the 32-bit libraries of TTSynth?
