Lou Dobbs Tonight
Wednesday, May 16, 2007

The Southern Poverty Law Center has made outrageous claims
against Lou Dobbs. Tonight, Lou will tell them why they're just
plain wrong. We'll be joined by the Center's president, Richard
Cohen, and its intelligence project director, Mark Potok. Make
sure to watch this debate unfold tonight.

Several states are discouraged by the federal government’s
efforts to regulate food imports. Now Alabama, Mississippi and
Louisiana have decided to go it alone and institute their own
standards and inspection procedures for catfish. Chinese
catfish imports have been tainted with a powerful antibiotic
that is dangerous for human consumption. We’ll have that story
tonight.

A Bush nominee to run the Consumer Product Safety Commission
will reportedly receive an extra $150,000 when he leaves his
National Association of Manufacturers job and moves into a
position that enforces members of the industry he used to work
for. Another case of the revolving door? We’ll discuss that
possibility tonight.

We’ll also bring you the latest developments on the last-minute
maneuvering for a compromise on the comprehensive immigration
reform bill.

And Governors Bill Richardson of New Mexico and Janet
Napolitano of Arizona sent letters to President Bush about the
crisis at the border, asking the president to allocate funds
for border agents and security technology as well as address
the problems that will arise if the National Guard presence at
the border is reduced. What will come of this?

news knowledge ion our Week in Review quiz and for more on
tonight’s show.

Lou Dobbs lays out his manifesto to save the middle class in
his new book, “War on the Middle Class: How the Government, Big
Business, and Special Interest Groups Are Waging War on the
American Dream and How to Fight Back.” War on the Middle Class
is now on sale in bookstores near you and on Amazon.com and
BarnesandNoble.com.
