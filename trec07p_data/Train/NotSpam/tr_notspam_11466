TONIGHT ON THE CBS EVENING NEWS
<http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/eveningnews/main3420.shtml>=20

Here is an early preview of what we are planning for tonight's CBS
EVENING NEWS from Anchor and Managing Editor, Katie Couric...=20

Hi everyone,=20

This could be a landmark day for immigration in the United States. Key
senators from both parties agreed with the White House on an immigration
overhaul that claims to fortify the U.S. border and quickly give legal
status to the millions of illegal immigrants who already live in the
United States. President Bush called the proposal "orderly and fair."
Sharyl Attkisson will explain the plan and Sandra Hughes will look at
the potential political and economic ramifications.=20

In Iraq, the massive search continues for the missing U.S. soldiers from
the 10th Mountain Division. More than 4,000 troops were on the hunt this
week, and our Mark Strassmann will have a firsthand report from the area
that's being searched.=20

And to cap off our series Gotta Have It: The Hard Sell to Kids, Nancy
Cordes will report that Generation Next is earning a new moniker:
Generation Plastic. The average college student graduates with more than
$3,000 in credit card debt, and now marketers are trying to hook kids as
young as 3-years-old to spend money they don't have.=20

We'll wrap up tonight's broadcast by giving you a peak inside the
handwritten diaries Ronald Reagan kept during his eight years in the
White House. What was his revelation after being shot? What ailment did
he warn you can catch from your kids? Join us for the answers tonight.=20

Thanks!=20

learn more from the authors of the book I Was A Really Good Mom Before I

MIKE MYERS IN SHREK THE THIRD: It has been almost four years since we've

favorite green Ogre. Friday morning, we'll speak with Myers about making
the latest in the Shrek comedies.=20

THAT'S THE WAY IT IS: WALTER CRONKITE AT 90: It is the rare "celebrity"
who is as reverentially talked about by Mike Wallace and Bill Clinton as
by George Clooney and Robin Williams. Walter Cronkite, now 90 years of
age, fits that bill. The iconic newsman's colleagues and friends will
celebrate his professional and personal lives in a one-hour primetime
special to be broadcast Friday, night on CBS.=20

CSI BEHIND THE SCENES: Another shocking season finale for powerhouse
CSI. Thursday night's episode will shock fans as one of the CSI team

"THAT'S THE WAY IT IS: CELEBRATING CRONKITE AT 90" FRIDAY, MAY 18TH
(8-9pmET/PT)=20

The world is a very different place than it was in the 1960s and '70s
when one voice seemed to speak for all Americans and, in so doing, to
bind the nation together. That unique and iconic voice was, of course,
Walter Cronkite's. CBS News will celebrate the legendary newsman's
singular life and career in a CBS News primetime special, "THAT'S THE
WAY IT IS - CELEBRATING CRONKITE AT 90," to be broadcast Friday, May
18th (8:00-9:00 PM, ET/PT) on the CBS Television Network.=20
________________________________


SATURDAY ON 48 HOURS
<http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/48hours/main3410.shtml>=20

Here's a note from Producer Miguel Sancho on Saturday's 48 Hours
Mystery, Beyond the Boardwalk:=20

"This report is a heartbreaker. It chronicles the tragic descent of four
beloved but troubled women onto the harsh streets of Atlantic City, and
their ultimate demise at the hands of a suspected serial killer. Like
any good 48 Hours Mystery episode, this program provides in-depth
coverage of the crime and the investigation: the case is a true
whodunit, replete with intriguing clues and some very unusual suspects.
But just as importantly, the report explores the dynamics of the
criminal underworld where the victims, and many young women like them,
found themselves trapped in a vicious cycle of drug-abuse, prostitution,
and violence.=20

=46rom a producer's perspective, covering this story was an intense and
harrowing experience. Atlantic City is an awesome place -- in the very
literal sense of inspiring awe. To its great credit, Atlantic City does
not pretend to be Disneyland - it is an unabashed adult entertainment
environment. And it cannot be denied that the gaming industry has
created tens of thousands of jobs, and streamed countless millions of
tax revenues into the state. Still, when you first arrive in town, the
contrast between the hulking casinos and the squalor that surrounds them
is a shock. Frankly the place can look like a collaboration of Bukowski
and Bosch. Then, as you start to get a sense of how the streets operate
and who the players are - the not-so-hidden economy of sin-seeking
tourists, drug dealers, hustlers, and street-walkers - there's the
thrill of gaining secret, specialized knowledge. Atlantic City is,
truly, one of most fascinating places I have ever been, and for the
journalist and the junkie alike, the action of street life is an
addiction all its own. But after a while, as you become attached to
people whose lives are so sad and hopeless, reporting becomes an
emotional ordeal. It is hard to wade through all the human wreckage of
the city's dark side without absorbing some of the suffering one
witnesses. After three days there, you want desperately to leave. Of
course once you've left you can think only about going back.=20

It may be easy for people to dismiss the murders as a story of four
women who succumbed to their own bad judgment and worse luck. Others may
see the killer as a something of an allegorical figure, a human
embodiment of the danger and damage of drug addiction. But if there's
one thing I hope the viewers remember, it is that these women, for all
their problems, were very real human beings. They all had families and
friends who loved them. They all had young children. And whatever bad
choices they'd made, none of them deserved this."=20
