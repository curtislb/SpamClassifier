Hi

I didn't see anything about a British voice.  We all assume that the English ViaVoice is Reid which is American.

The lfs team have a script to unpack debs and rpms.  So that they can be installed on a lfs / blfs system.  Can't remember what it is called.  I guess slackware users would need it too, in that case.

The U.K. voice is available, as is noted in our announcement.

Aside from Fedora rpm, or Debian/Ubuntu .deb, we have no distro specific
packaging at this time, unfortunately.
