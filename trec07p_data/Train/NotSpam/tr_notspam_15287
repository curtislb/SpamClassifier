That will only work if there are no previous patterns in your program
otherwise:

perldoc perlop

[ snip ]

        If the PATTERN evaluates to the empty string, the last successfully
        matched regular expression is used instead. In this case, only
        the "g" and "c" flags on the empty pattern is honoured - the other
        flags are taken from the original pattern. If no match has
        previously succeeded, this will (silently) act instead as a genuine
        empty pattern (which will always match).
