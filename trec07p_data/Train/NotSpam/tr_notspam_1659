PRESS RELEASE
American Bar Association International Cultural Property Committee Examines
Collecting Chinese Art and Antiquities: Hot Trade Heats Up
For Immediate Release
A panel discussion sponsored by the International Cultural Property
Committee of the Section of International Law & Practice of the American Bar
Association and co-sponsored by the Lawyers? Committee for Cultural Heritage
Preservation. The program will be held Friday, May 4, 4:30-6:00 pm, at the
Fairmont Hotel, Washington, DC. 
?
COLLECTING CHINESE ART AND ANTIQUITIES: HOT TRADE HEATS UP
Collecting Chinese antiquities is back in fashion today. This program seeks
to investigate some of the legal and ethical dilemmas of contemporary
collecting in this field. China is one of the largest source countries for
antiquities in the world and has requested a bilateral agreement with the
United States to help curb some of the illicit trafficking of cultural
property currently taking place. Although CPAC (the Cultural Property
Advisory Committee) in Washington has met to discuss this request for a new
bilateral agreement with China in conjunction with a public session, a
decision on whether there should be an agreement is still pending. The
issues to be examined in this program include looting of archeological
sites; unprovenanced cultural property; and the problem of fakes, forgeries
and authenticity -- discussed from various points of view and ideologies.

 Nathan Hale statue recovered in Chaplin
By: Lee Sawyer , Journal Inquirer

COVENTRY - Nathan Hale's statue is in police custody today, recovered 
from the town of Chaplin with the help of an anonymous tipster.

He is in good condition, except for being broken at his base, police said.
The bronze likeness of the national hero was taken sometime before April 
5 from the Nathan Hale Homestead. The homestead was closed for the 
season, and police aren't exactly sure when the statue was taken.
Police Chief Mark A. Palmer said the department received a tip Thursday 
that the statue was in Chaplin near a fishing area next to the Natchaug 
River.
Police located the statue there, and are arranging to return it to the 
Homestead, which is operated by the Antiquarian and Landmarks Society of 
Hartford.
No one has been arrested, and police still are looking for the culprit, 
they said.
Rochelle Simon, a society spokeswoman, said that no one had tried to 
claim the $1,000 reward that had been offered by an anonymous benefactor 
for the statue's return.
She said the group is grateful to the police for their work, and thanked 
news organizations for publicizing the theft, perhaps resulting in the tip.
As for the statue, "It's in good shape, except that it's missing its 
feet. We're obviously going to have a restoration process," she said.
Nathan Hale was born June 6, 1755, and was a captain in the Army during 
the American Revolution.
Considered America's first spy, Hale went on an intelligence-gathering 
mission before being caught by the British and hanged.
He is widely remembered as saying, "I only regret that I have but one 
life to lose for my country."
Renowned New England sculptor Bela Lyon Pratt created the 3-foot, 
approximately 100-pound statue.
Pratt, born Dec. 11, 1867 in Norwich, studied at the Yale School of Fine 
Arts and became an instructor at the Boston Museum School of Fine Arts.
President Theodore Roosevelt commissioned him to redesign two gold 
coins, the Indian-head half-dollar and the eagle quarter.
Pratt also has pieces in the Library of Congress, Museum of Fine Arts in 
Boston, Harvard University, and the state Capitol.
The homestead will open for the season May 12.

SA's treasures worth millions going missing

By Anel Powell

Millions and millions of rands worth of heritage resources have been 
stolen from state institutions.

This was stated on Thursday by Phakamani Buthelezi, chief executive of 
the SA Heritage Resources Agency (Sahra).

This is why a R28,5-million national audit of heritage resources under 
state custodianship was started in 2004. Although still in the early 
stages, the initial count of heritage assets has revealed there is much 
that cannot be accounted for.

'Massive black market in stolen goods'
Buthelezi said without a reliable database of heritage items, it was 
difficult to say how many items had been lost or stolen, or what the 
value of these items was. But he said it would amount to many millions 
of rands.

He said many items had been "inappropriately" removed from the country.

Roger Layton, of service provider Ciber, said the thefts of valuable 
resources meant there was a "massive black market in stolen goods".

After the high-profile thefts of state resources, including the 
Mendelssohn diamond ring from parliament and a R3-million gold tea set 
from Tuynhuys, the national government approved the development of a 
national heritage database in 2004.

The five pilot sites of the audit were Tuynhuys, Groote Schuur and 
parliament in Cape Town, and the Union Buildings and Bryntirion Estate 
in Pretoria. More than 5 600 assets were audited at the first five sites.

Unlike traditional audits that count furniture and other movable items, 
the heritage audit included only rare, significant or valuable items.

One of the collections was valued at between R100-million and 
R500-million, while several others were worth more than R10-million each.

David Hart, manager of the national audit unit, said these sites were 
chosen for the first phase because they were not managed by a museum.

"We were therefore concerned that these items would be more vulnerable."

He added: "To know what is lost, we first have to know what we have."

Sahra is working with Interpol and the South African Police Service on 
the listing of heritage items to make it easier for them to be 
identified if stolen. It includes the taking of high-quality photographs 
of all the items.

Layton said the national audit was the biggest of its kind ever done in 
South Africa. It would allow the agency to identify how many collections 
exist and how their items were being managed.

The audit would result in a national database of information about the 
country's valuable movable and immovable heritage resources.

Because of their vulnerability, movable assets were being prioritised by 
the pilot audit.

Layton said the audit was not a one-off count, but could be done regularly.

The initial heritage survey revealed the treatment of many assets was 
not suitable. There was little documentation and often no photographs.

Some sites, especially government sites, were difficult to access. He 
said that at many government departments there was no central management 
of the heritage resources.

Buthelezi made an appeal for more funds to continue with the national 
audit, saying "R28,5-million is just not enough".

The centralisation of information on heritage resources would make it 
possible to create virtual museums on the Internet and make it easier to 
track other institutions' items.

*Gone in 50 seconds*

Edward Dolnick's Stealing the Scream follows the trail of a missing 
Munch from Norway to Scotland Yard and back, says Ian Pindar

*Stealing The Scream: The Hunt for a Missing Masterpiece *
by Edward Dolnick
272pp, Icon, ?12.99

It took about 50 seconds to steal The Scream. Early one February morning 
in 1994, a man climbed a ladder, smashed a first-floor window of the 
National Gallery in Oslo, clambered inside and slid the famous painting 
down the ladder to an accomplice. He left behind a postcard depicting 
three red-faced men laughing. On the back were the words: "Thanks for 
the poor security." Inadequate security was the least of the gallery's 
problems. The Scream had been stolen on the very day that the Winter 
Olympics began in Lillehammer, so it was guaranteed maximum press 
coverage. "The theft was a jeering insult," explains Edward Dolnick in 
this gripping account of how The Scream was stolen, "a raised middle 
finger directed at Norway's cultural and political elite."

When Edvard Munch first exhibited The Scream in 1893, he was accused of 
dipping his finger in excrement and smearing it around. By 1994 it had 
become a much-loved icon of modernity and was valued at $72m. Its loss 
shocked the nation and rocked the art world. Norway wanted its 
masterpiece back, but every trail went cold. Enter Christopher Charles 
Roberts, a fast-talking representative of California's Getty Museum, who 
offered to negotiate with the thieves on behalf of the Norwegians. The 
deal was that if the Getty bought The Scream from whoever had taken it, 
then in return Norway would loan it the painting to hang alongside 
another work in the Getty collection, James Ensor's Christ's Entry into 
Brussels in 1889 (1888), a proto-expressionist masterpiece.

It was a good plan, and before long Roberts was meeting two of the 
thieves in the lobby of an Oslo hotel. A deal was struck, although 
unbeknown to the thieves there was one detail they had overlooked. 
Roberts didn't exist. He was in fact Charley Hill, a detective from 
Scotland Yard's art and antiques unit. As Dolnick reveals how this 
elaborate undercover operation came into being, he perfectly captures 
the thrill of planning a sting. "You're a bit like a scriptwriter," says 
one art squad detective. "It's a challenge to come up with something 
that has a genuine feel to it." Roberts certainly felt genuine. The 
Getty even falsified payroll files going back several years in case 
anyone investigated their imaginary employee.

Charley Hill is the hero of this book; a gruff, no-nonsense Gene Hunt 
figure with a love of fine art. As Dolnick observes admiringly, Hill can 
be studying the brushstrokes in an Old Master one minute and kicking 
down doors the next. As a young man he actually volunteered to fight in 
Vietnam (his father was American, his mother English) out of 
"intellectual curiosity". He has an impressive rapport with criminals, 
especially the most violent ones, and he also conforms to a familiar 
trope of all TV detectives: he trusts his instincts. He knows how to 
"read crooks" and how to lie. ("When you lie, lie big," he advises any 
wannabe undercover agents. "What gets you in trouble is lying about the 
little things; that's when things get hard to remember and when you trip 
yourself up.") He also knows when the time is right to do a deal and 
when to say "Go fuck yourself!" - a gamble that pays off in this 
instance as Hill successfully recovers The Scream

Hill regards art crime as a "serious farce", and that's just how Dolnick 
plays it, with journalistic verve, in this enjoyable book. A recurring 
theme is lack of funding. Scotland Yard's "Scream team" is so strapped 
for cash that Hill can't afford the books he needs to swot up on the 
painting. And if security is poor in the world's public art galleries 
it's because the galleries are poor. Yet art crime is a thriving 
industry. As much as $6bn a year could be changing hands in the art 
underworld.

The phenomenal rise in the price of art in recent decades has not been 
matched by any extra security in galleries, so they are sitting targets 
for opportunistic thieves. "Art theft is such an easy game and the 
penalties for getting caught are so low," says Dolnick, "that the most 
hopeless sap can play." Unfortunately this sometimes means great art 
gets destroyed. When Cranach the Elder's Sybille of Cleves was stolen by 
a French waiter, the thief's mother tried to hide the evidence by 
cutting it up and throwing it out with the trash. We can only hope that 
the 551 Picassos, 209 Renoirs, 174 Rembrandts and 43 Van Goghs currently 
still missing have not suffered a similar fate.

Polic?a retira cargos contra sospechoso adquirir arte precolombino robado

Copenhague

La polic?a danesa inform? hoy de que ha retirado por falta de pruebas la 
acusaci?n de encubrimiento contra un coleccionista dan?s que pose?a m?s 
de mil objetos de arte precolombino procedentes de Colombia, Per? y Ecuador.

Las autoridades de estos tres pa?ses informaron de que los objetos 
fueron exportados violando sus legislaciones, pero no han probado que 
procedan de un robo u otro delito punible en Dinamarca, de acuerdo con 
la fuente.

Agentes de la polic?a encontraron el pasado verano en el s?tano de la 
casa del coleccionista, al norte de Copenhague, m?s de mil vasijas, 
figuras de piedra y cuencos procedentes adem?s de otros pa?ses como 
M?xico, Costa Rica y China, que le fueron requisados.

La esposa del coleccionista y un intermediario fueron tambi?n acusados 
inicialmente por la polic?a, aunque les fueron retirados los cargos.
    
Los pa?ses afectados enviaron a expertos en arte a Dinamarca para 
determinar el valor de las piezas.

De acuerdo con el sistema legal dan?s, es la polic?a la que decide si 
hay pruebas para trasladar un caso a los tribunales o si, como considera 
en esta ocasi?n, no son suficientes y la probabilidad de que no se 
llegue a producir una condena es elevada.

La Fiscal?a General del Estado es la que tiene la ?ltima palabra en el caso.

El coleccionista, Jan Erik Pelle, que asegur? haber comprado las obras 
de buena fe en subastas, ha anunciado que pedir? una indemnizaci?n de 10 
millones de coronas danesas (1,8 millones de d?lares) al Estado por las 
obras confiscadas, que no cuenta con recuperar.

La Organizaci?n de las Naciones Unidas para la Educaci?n y la Ciencia y 
la Cultura (UNESCO) ha criticado con anterioridad la legislaci?n danesa 
por no dar la cobertura jur?dica necesaria a la convenci?n contra el 
tr?fico ilegal de obras de arte, a la que Dinamarca se adhiri? hace a?os.
