Yes, that actually was what I meant.  I have had no
problems with SPSS 12 but 14 seems a bit nasty.

I have simply moved to exporting the SPSS file to a
delimited file and loading it. Unfortunately I'm
losing all the labelling which can be time-consuming
to redo.    Some of the data has something like 10
categories for a variable.
