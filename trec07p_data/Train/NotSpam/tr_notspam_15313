However it was a little confusing to write

  split '\/', $file_path;

when what was meant was

  split '/', $file_path;

The former appears to split on the literal value '\/' but, because the
string is reinterpolated into a regex, the effect is the same as just '/'.
Bizarrely, to actually split on '\/' would require

  split '\\\/', $file_path;
