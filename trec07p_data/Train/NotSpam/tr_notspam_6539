Nevertheless, the statement is true.  R is implemented using pointers.

For the record, it is old S terminology: that document was converted from 
notes for S.  What S(-PLUS) now calls 'chapters' it used to call 
directories.

Also for the record, these documents do not have page numbers: their 
layout depends on the version of R, paper size and the tools used to 
prepare them.
