For testing, the permutation test may be prefered to the bootstrap
(though the bootstrap could be used for a confidence interval).

I remember in grad school doing a project on comparing the efficiency of
a permutation test on medians compared to the MannWhitney test, but I
don't remember the specifics of when each was better.  Do any of the
other participants in this discussion have any ideas on how the
permutation tests compare to what else has been discussed?

The MannWhitney test is actually a special case of the permutation test,
but using the median permutation test is more intuitive to my mind.  The
permutation test is actually testing the null hypothesis that the 2
distributions are identical, but no assumptions about normality,
skewness, shift hypotheses, etc..  Though the efficiency of the test
statistic used would depend somewhat on the nature of the alternatives
of interest (imagine 2 distributions with the same mean, but different
medians, or same median, but different mean; a permutation test
comparing means or medians would differ in the 2 cases).

I'll have to try some simulations looking at a permutation test on
efron's dice.
