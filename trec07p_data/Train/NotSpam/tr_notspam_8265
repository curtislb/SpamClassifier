hi guys,
hopefully a really simple question- Within my activity, I would like to
open the browser with a certain html page which is saved let's say in
olpc/Library/.
How do I do this? Can I have the browser run in full screen mode so there
will be no navigation bar? The idea is to run a .swf file within the
Mozilla browser. It works already but people have to still type in the
locally stored URL of the website at this point. I would like to give them
the regular look and feel of Icons within the sugar interface.
Thanks mucho!
Jan
