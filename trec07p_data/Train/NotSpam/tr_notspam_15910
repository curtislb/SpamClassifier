That makes it even better.

If you get sued and convicted as a private person in a jurisdiction that
is not yours, there are two possible outcomes:
* You try to defend yourself, and might win or lose depending on the
  case. If you go to the jurisdiction where you are being sued, the end
  result might be that enforcement is likely.
* You do nothing, and nothing happens

You see, if a judge in the U.S. decides that I am guilty as charged
based upon evidence brought before him, I couldn't care less. Belgium
does not extradite its own citizens unless those have been convicted by
Belgian judges and found guilty; so as long as I do not do anything
which might be illegal by Belgian law, there's nothing to stop me from
not following the license. Sure, that probably means I should be wary of
going to the U.S. while convicted there, but perhaps I can live with
that. And indeed, since extradition isn't for civil cases, they wouldn't
even ask for extradition in the first place.

On top of that, the licensor couldn't even sue me in Belgium, since then
*I* could invoke the choice-of-venue clause to prevent that.

Hadn't thought of that before, but I'm starting to like these clauses.
