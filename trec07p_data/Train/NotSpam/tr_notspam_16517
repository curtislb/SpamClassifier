If you're going to be sued for something you didn't do, and lose because
in your absence you're assumed to have done it, why not go the whole
hog and just have them assert you've used/distributed a program you've
never actually used/distributed?

AFAICS this is an issue only when there's a not completely trivial
possibility that you have actually violated the license.

Speaking of which, the linux.conf.au 2008 CFP is open:

	http://linux.conf.au/presentations

I suspect that anyone who can get their paper accepted will be able to get
their travel costs covered by one of LCA, Debian or the Linux Foundation.

For Australia, assuming you were being sued over free software stuff
that you'd be doing in good faith, I think we could do a fairly good
job helping you out.

Yes, Australian lawyers seem to be in a very inconvenient timezone for
me... ;)

Clearly not. BTW, that site doesn't seem to exist.

The difference between blackjack and choice of venue is that in one
case you're being compelled to do something, and in the other you're
pre-determining an argument. AFAICS that breaks that analogy.

Two different analogous licenses might be:

  By distributing the covered work, you agree that the copyright holder
  can sue you for violations of the license.

  If you distribute the covered work, the licensor agrees not to sue you
  in any jurisdiction other than Berlin, Germany.

I'd consider both those to be clearly free. Choice of venue goes beyond
either of them, certainly. But I'm still not seeing a way in which it
goes so far beyond them as to become non-free.

Heck, is choice of venue actually different to the combination of those
clauses?

TTBOMK, no. ITYM "acting on behalf of SPI" rather than "on SPI's payroll"
btw. :)

Well, that's only true over the long term, and I don't think it's
necessarily true even over the long term for court cases.
