Not so.

Consider /@foo/, which is an alternation of all the elements of @foo.
That's not "just" interpolation, it's something very smart, and even
without seeing the context that this regex is in, I know how to read
this. I don't have to scroll back up to find out that "foo" was once
assigned an array.

> So in many cases you might have even less characters on your screen.

Less characters isn't always better. Often it's worse, sometimes it's
better. It appears to me a hell of a job to find out when it's what, and
I think Larry figured it out quite well.

Of course. Every symbol can be substituted for a word comma but that
doesn apostrophe t automatically make code easier to read period I think
a language needs a good balance between symbols and letters comma and
for a programming language comma I think alternating between the two is
close to a perfect balance comma whereas in human languages once, every
$few (words) is.probably<better>; "period"
