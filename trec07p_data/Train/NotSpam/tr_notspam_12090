I'm doing a piece on pharmaceutical companies that sell the same drug
under two different names for two different uses.

The most recent example I am aware of  is Novartis, which makes
zoledronic acid (Zometa). Zometa is approved for treating bone mets.
Novartis hopes to soon begin selling zoledronic acid as Reclast  for
the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. It's the exact same drug,
just two different names.

I'm curious as to whether anyone knows of any other similar examples.
(I know that Wyeth has "reformulated" Effexor to sell under a different
name for use as a hot flash treatment.)

Also, can anyone explain, or recommend someone who can comment on, the
benefits that pharmaceutical companies get (patent or exclusivity
extensions or otherwise) when they remarket a drug with a new name or
for a new use?

Thanks,
