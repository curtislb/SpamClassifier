2:00 PM, 6/21/07, Update: Bad weather forces one-day landing delay; updatin=
g Friday landing opportunities

Already running one orbit late, entry flight director Norm Knight, faced wi=
th low clouds, area thunderstorms and a pessimistic forecast, told the Atla=
ntis astronauts to back out of re-entry preparations and to stay in space a=
nother 24 hours.

"Yeah, we looked at it as hard and as long as we think is reasonable," astr=
onaut Dominic "Tony" Antonelli radioed commander Rick Sturckow around 1:30 =
p.m. "The rain showers and the ceilings are going to keep us from making it=
 into Florida today. Per the timeline, we're ready for you to flip over to =
deorbit prep back-out."

Atlantis has enough on-board supplies to remain in orbit until Sunday, but =
Knight has decided to bring the shuttle home Friday, at either Kennedy or E=
dwards Air Force Base, Calif., if the weather permits.

"The weather forecast for KSC and also what we had given you for Edwards ha=
sn't changed too much for tomorrow so we're going to be fighting the same c=
hallenges at KSC," Antonelli radioed. "At Edwards, the winds are going to p=
ick up. So what we've come up with is in about three hours, we're going to =
do an 11-foot-per second (rocket firing) and what that's going to do for us=
 is pull in an earlier Edwards opportunity and have the potential to get in=
 there before the winds pick up."

"OK, understand if we don't get into KSC tomorrow then you're shooting for =
Edwards after you get two looks at KSC?" Sturckow asked.

"We are, of course, calling up Edwards tomorrow," Antonelli said. "We'll ha=
ve the first look at KSC and now the second look at KSC will overlap with t=
he first look at Edwards. And of course, after the end of the day we'll hav=
e a better look at the Saturday forecast, so we're going to put all that in=
to the equation. But we'll be calling up both KSC and Edwards tomorrow."

"OK, we understand, so tomorrow if you don't get into KSC and the weather i=
s good at Edwards, you intend to go to Edwards. But if the weather is bad a=
t both places, then we'll look at Saturday and see what happens."

"Yeah, if the weather is good at Edwards tomorrow, just like you said, and =
not at KSC, then we're going to land there," Antonelli agreed. "We are goin=
g to try to land tomorrow."

"OK, yep, we understand that," Sturckow said. "Thank you very much, Houston=
. Sounds like a great game plan."

The astronauts have two landing opportunities in Florida on Friday - at 2:1=
8 p.m. and 3:54 p.m. - and, with the rocket firing later today, three at Ed=
wards Air Force Base, Calif.

Here is an updated list of all available landing opportunities Friday, Satu=
rday and Sunday at Kennedy (KSC), Edwards (EDW) and White Sands Space Harbo=
r, N.M. (NOR). This list includes the additional Edwards opportunity Friday=
 that was discussed by Antonelli (all times in EDT and subject to change):
