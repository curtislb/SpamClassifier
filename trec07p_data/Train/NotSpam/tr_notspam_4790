Hi all, I know this is off-topic for this list in a way because it 
deals with orca, but then not so ot, because I want to get speakup 
running after install.  I am trying to install ubuntu 7.04, and was 
wondering if someone here can help.  An over-the-phone walk through 
would be awesome, but will settle for E-mail.  Here is my 
problem:  When I boot the live cd and enter a terminal, speech seems 
to be fine.  When I follow instructions I found on the orca wiki, 
that say to enter "sudo su, unload orca, then type "orca --no-setup 
--disable main-window", I get the welcome, then a message that says, 
"switching to focus tracking mode", then no speech.  If anyone can 
help, it would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks much,


Guy
