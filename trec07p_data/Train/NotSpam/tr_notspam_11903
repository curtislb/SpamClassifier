FYI, Antenna Alliance, a CC recording project out of Boston, MA and
expanding to other cities is recording bands free of cost and promoting the
music to college radio stations in exchange for releasing the music under CC
licenses. (They are very heavily promoting  CC BY and BY-SA and as a result,
most, but not all of the music is under those licenses).

The site is still in the works, but you can find out more info at
www.antalliance.org.
