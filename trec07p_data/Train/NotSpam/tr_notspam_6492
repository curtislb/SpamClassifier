We're most of the way through the implementation of PDD 15, but still 
have a few final steps before it can completely replace the current 
implementation. Much of the current implementation of OO lives in 
src/objects.c and src/ops/object.ops. Much of the code is specific to 
the ParrotClass/ParrotObject way of doing things.

To finish off the implementation we can either branch, rip out the old 
implementation, and reintegrate (the "big thud" approach, as chromatic 
would call it), or we can refactor the existing ops and supporting code 
to support the old and new metamodels, and when both are passing all the 
tests, we can switch 'newclass' over to creating new style classes by 
default.

In this case, my preference is the refactor approach. We need to support 
multiple class/object implementations anyway. Refactoring to support the 
two we have now moves us closer to our goals than simply replacing the 
old implementation. Running two implementations will also force us to 
respect encapsulation boundaries much more than the current 
implementation does.

Any concerns? Existing uses of OO code shouldn't be affected until we 
make the switch of 'newclass' creating new classes by default. I suspect 
PGE and TGE are our heaviest users of the current object implementation 
and will act as the best stress test.
