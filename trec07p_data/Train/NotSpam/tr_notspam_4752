 When the package in question is a class, it is also possible to declare 
 real methods or submethods:
 
-    multi method CANDO ($self: Code, $name; *%args --> Container)
+    multi method CANDO ($self: Code, $name, *%args --> Container)

 The method form is inherited by subclasses.  Submethods are never
 inherited but may still do MMD within the class.   (Ordinary multisubs
 are inherited only to the extent allowed by the MMD mechanism.)
 
-=for DISCUSSION
-The following should really be in S12 if really works this way, but
-I'm not sure it does.  Seems like something is wrong, but I can't
-quite put my finger on it.  Something like, different containers want
-different default values, but we've probably lost track of the container.
-So anyway, the rest of this section is considered conjectural.
-
-When someone tries to actually call or access an undefined object
-(which may have come from one of the routines above, or might have just
-been declared with a body of C<{...}>), or might just be a variable
-declared without an initializer, a different hook is used to define
-actual behavior at the last moment:
-
-    submethod AUTODEF ($self:) { ... }
-
-(Unlike the C<CANDO> interface, we do not pass the package.)
-
-This routine is passed an uninitialized (or underinitialized) object,
-and is expected to define or build the object, but not to call it,
-since the call is already "scheduled" from somewhere else.  (Perl 5's
-C<goto &$AUTOLOAD> is implicit, in other words.  But you can hijack
-the call via the C<call> builtin, in which case the autoloader behaves
-just like a wrapper--see S06.)
-
-In any case, there is no longer any magical C<$AUTOLOAD> variable.
-The C<AUTODEF> is a mutator, and thus is not expected to return the
-object.  No name is passed to C<AUTODEF>--in a context where a name
-is being declared at call time, the name is automatically introduced
-with C<CANDO> before C<AUTODEF> is called.  The outer container,
-if available, is accessed via C<$+CONTAINER>.  In the case of a
-sub call, the call's unbound C<ArgList> object will be available
-via C<$+ARGLIST>.  C<$+ARGLIST> is a rw variable, and mutations to it
-will be seen by the eventual "real" call.
-
-If a C<AUTODEF> submethod wishes merely to perform some action without
-defining C<$self>, that is fine.  It needs to signal that desire by
-use of an explicit "return;" statement.
-
-A C<AUTODEF> submethod is really just a variant of C<BUILD> with no named
-arguments.  As with C<BUILD>, default values for attributes are applied at
-the end for any attributes not explicitly set.  A typical C<AUTODEF>
-definition might be:
-
-    submethod AUTODEF { self.=BUILD }
-
-or maybe even just:
-
-    our &AUTODEF ::= &BUILD;
