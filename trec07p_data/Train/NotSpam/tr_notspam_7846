I am glad to help.  The pp program is the main tool to use to create the executable.

I took a quick look at the PAR page on CPAN, and it seems possible to 
build a DLL that incorporates the interpreter, and then each individual 
script .exe could be much smaller.  I'll see if I can get that to work; 
it would be really nice to be able to drop the Perl requirement.  If we 
could do that, I'd include the command line tools plus the compiled 
scripts with the basic R distribution, so you could easily build simple 
packages.  The Rtools.exe installer would then just need to install the 
MinGW compilers for packages containing compiled code, and a few extras 
needed for building R.

I don't really know Perl, so I might be asking for advice if I get stuck.
