I'm just saying that "you need to argue the same thing" isn't much of a
barrier, since AFAIK the people arguing against choice-of-venue clauses on
this theory have already done so in the past and are likely to do so again
if given cause ;)

That's a good goal; but Debian has disagreed with other folks in the past
because we believed their interpretations were irrational and contrary to
the long-term interests of Free Software, and it's my own opinion that
various folks in the wider community are in this position today, so I hope
that such meshing is the result of a sustained dialogue and not just Debian
giving in to whatever the folks with the cool technology of the day that
everyone wants to use have are peddling as a license.
