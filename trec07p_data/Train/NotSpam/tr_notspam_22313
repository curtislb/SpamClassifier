I will just voice my support for putting best-of-breed modules for very
common tasks (CGI, DBI for sure) in the core.  It may not be elegant, but
it is practical... and Perl has weighed in on that side of the dilemma
before.  I think part of Perl 4's success was the "one stop shopping"
availability of numerous useful functions that would otherwise have
required linking in a library, e.g. dbmopen, crypt, shmget, gethostbyaddr,
math functions, etc.  I think the synergistic effect of the combination of
all these functions being so readily available helped Perl take off. 
Please continue the tradition of tending to err on the side of "practical"
over "elegant".  It may not seem rational that avoiding the need to type
"cpan Foo::Bar" makes a huge difference, but I believe it does, for
certain modules.
