CBS NEWS STS-117 STATUS REPORT: 79
Posted: 8:19 AM, 6/20/07

By William Harwood
CBS News Space Analyst

Changes and additions:

   SR-76 (06/19/07): Shuttle undocking on tap
   SR-77 (06/19/07): Atlantis undocks from space station
   SR-78 (06/19/07): Heat shield scan; analysts study debris
   SR-79 (06/20/07): Astronauts pack up for Thursday landing

8:19 AM, 6/20/07, Update: Astronauts pack up for Thursday landing=20

Keeping tabs on threatening weather, the Atlantis astronauts faced a busy d=
ay in space today, packing up equipment, setting up a recumbent seat for re=
turning space station flier Sunita Williams and testing the shuttle's contr=
ol systems to make sure they're ready for re-entry and landing Thursday at =
the Kennedy Space Center.

Commander Rick Sturckow and pilot Lee Archambault also plan to get in a bit=
 of practice with a laptop computer flight simulator to rehearse landing pr=
ocedures. A final round of media interviews is scheduled for 3:03 p.m. and =
the shuttle's KU-band antenna will be stowed for entry at 6:58 p.m., ending=
 routine television from the orbiter.

Deorbit ignition is planned for 12:50 p.m. Thursday with landing on tap at =
1:55 p.m.

There are no technical problems with the space shuttle and the only questio=
n mark is the weather. As of late Tuesday, the KSC forecast called for scat=
tered clouds at 3,000 feet, a broken deck at 5,000 feet, overcast at 12,000=
 feet, winds gusting to 13 knots from 210 degrees and thunderstorms within =
30 nautical miles. The low ceilings and lightning activity both violate NAS=
A's landing flight rules.

At Edwards Air Force Base in California, the outlook is favorable for the f=
irst of two Thursday opportunities, but high winds are expected to build up=
 as the day wears on. At White Sands, N.M., forecasters are expecting a sli=
ght chance of thunderstorms within 30 nautical miles.

The outlook in Florida remains questionable Friday and into the weekend. An=
 updated forecast will be available later today and entry flight director N=
orm Knight plans to brief reporters on his entry strategy during a 5 p.m. n=
ews conference.

In the meantime, here is an updated schedule of today's activities (in EDT =
and mission elapsed time; includes rev. P of the NASA television schedule:
