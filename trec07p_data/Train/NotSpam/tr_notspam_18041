An important potential benefit of R solutions shared by awk, sed, ...
is that they provide a reproducible way to  document  exactly how one  
got
from one version of the data to the next.  This  seems to be the main
problem with handicraft methods like editing excel files, it  is too
easy to introduce  new errors that can't be tracked down at later
stages of the analysis.
