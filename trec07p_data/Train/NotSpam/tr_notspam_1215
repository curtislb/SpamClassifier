Better late than never!  ;-)

Agreed, especially with (3)!

I think that you should insert this new proposal in the Wiki page, or at
least a link to your debian-legal message[1].

[1] that is to say:
http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2007/04/msg00071.html

I think this sounds really good.
Maybe some minor wording enhancements could be applied in order to make
it great, but I would not know exactly which.
Hence, for the time being, I second your proposed trademark license.

[snip examples...]

The examples look great too.

> Thoughts welcome.

So far, the only thing that comes to my mind is the following.
With your proposed plan, the Official Logo would become DFSG-free
(right?), which is *great*, but means that it could be incorporated in
packages included in Debian main.
Since in some cases that could imply that Debian derivatives should
purge at least some instances of the Official Logo (imagine Ubuntu or
MEPIS or Knoppix shipping with a Debian Official Logo in their default
GDM login splash screen... it would be inappropriate at best), I think
that maybe we should prevent the Official Logo from appearing in main.
How could this be done?  Forbidding the inclusion of the Official Logo
in main with a special Debian Policy rule?

I think the current DPL (Anthony Towns) and the newly elected DPL (Sam
Hocevar) should be pointed to this thread, as well as the SPI Board.
