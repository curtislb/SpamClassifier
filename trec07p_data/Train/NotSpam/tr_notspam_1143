						<b>IRAQ</b>
<br>

<br>
The bomb explosion in the Iraqi Parliament which killed three politicians a=
nd injured many other people is a serious breach of security in Baghdad's h=
eavily protected Green Zone. Tim Whewell will examine how and why this coul=
d have happened.
<br>

<br>
We hope to be speaking to a senior Iraqi politician.  And we'll be asking t=
he US Under Secretary of State, Nicholas Burns, what impact this will have =
on the US surge and exit strategies in Iraq.
<br>

<br>
<b>IRAN</b>
<br>

<br>
Our political editor, Michael Crick, is pursuing one of the key questions i=
n the payments to sailors? story.  Was Downing Street involved in fielding =
calls to newspapers and not just observing events?  He should have the answ=
ers on the programme tonight.
<br>

<br>
<b>BLAIR LEGACY</b>
<br>

<br>
With Tony Blair expected to stand down within a matter of weeks, his legacy=
 as Prime Minister is under close scrutiny.  For Newsnight, the American Re=
publican pollster Frank Luntz grills a room full of former Labour voters in=
 Birmingham on their views of the outgoing Prime Minister and how they judg=
e his premiership.=20
<br>

<br>
<b>PHILIP GLASS</b>
<br>

<br>
And it's taken 30 years for the first proper stage production of Philip Gla=
ss's Satyagraha to be performed in Britain. The opera, about the life of Ma=
hatma Gandhi, has just opened at the English National Opera in London.  In =
a rare interview, Philip Glass talks to our Culture Correspondent, Madelein=
e Holt, about the power of opera and his extraordinary career.=20
