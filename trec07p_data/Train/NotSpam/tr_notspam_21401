I am certainly for this idea.  I feel that taking Speakup out of the kernel 
and putting it in userspace would be stripping it of its most valuable 
feature--speaking from bootup to shutdown.  If the code can be updated and 
fixed properly, then it should be included in the mainline kernel.  Does 
anyone know what Linus's opinion of this is?
