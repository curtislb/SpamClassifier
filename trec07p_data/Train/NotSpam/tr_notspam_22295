Hello,

See the log with i run perl -MCPAN -e shell:

Now we need to know where your favorite CPAN sites are
located. Push
a few sites onto the array (just in case the first on
the array won't
work). If you are mirroring CPAN to your local
workstation, specify a
file: URL.

First, pick a nearby continent and country (you can
pick several of
each, separated by spaces, or none if you just want to
keep your
existing selections). Then, you will be presented with
a list of URLs
of CPAN mirrors in the countries you selected, along
with previously
selected URLs. Select some of those URLs, or just keep
the old list.
Finally, you will be prompted for any extra URLs --
file:, ftp:, or
http: -- that host a CPAN mirror.

Select your continent (or several nearby continents)
[]
Sorry! since you don't have any existing picks, you
must make a
geographic selection.

Select your continent (or several nearby continents)
[]
Sorry! since you don't have any existing picks, you
must make a
geographic selection.

I'm not understand, What do make now.

Best regards,

Rodrigo Faria
