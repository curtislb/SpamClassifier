rlp writes "Researchers at the Institute for Astronomy in Zurich are
reporting that [0]solar sunspot activity is at a 1000-year peak. Records
of sunspots have been kept since 1610. The period between 1645 and 1715
(known as the Maunder Minimum) was a period of very few sunspots.
Researchers extended the record by measuring isotopes of beryllium
(created by cosmic rays) in Greenland ice cores. Based on both
observations and ice core records, we are now at a sunspot peak exceeding
solar activity for any time in the past thousand years."

(which would improve the appearance of fonts) The reason given on the

several Microsoft patents and should not be activated in any default
build of the library.' As [2]reported on and [3]discussed, this matter
may be connected to the [4]Microsoft-Novell deal. If so, Novell should
have received a license for the Microsoft patents, assuming the deal
covered all relevant patents. Does the license therefore extend only to
SUSE, but not openSUSE?"

An anonymous reader writes "In the overlooked case between [0]Blizzard
and [1]MDY Industries, the creator of the WoWGlider bot, Blizzard is
arguing that using any programs in conjunction with the World of Warcraft
constitutes copyright violation. Apparently [2]accessing the copy of the
game client in RAM using another program infringes upon their rights.
Under that logic, users do not even have the right to use anti-virus
software in the event that the game becomes infected. Furthermore,
Blizzard's legal filings downplay the role of their [3]Warden software,
which actively scans users' RAM, CPU, and storage devices (and
potentially sensitive data) and sends information back to Blizzard to be
processed."

An anonymous reader writes "'1080p provides the sharpest, most lifelike
picture possible.' '1080p combines high resolution with a high frame
rate, so you see more detail from second to second.' This marketing copy
is largely accurate. 1080p can be significantly better that 1080i, 720p,
480p or 480i. But, (there's always a "but") there are qualifications. The
most obvious qualification: Is this performance improvement manifest
under [0]real world viewing conditions? After all, one can purchase
200mph speed-rated tires for a Toyota Prius®. Expectations of a real
performance improvement based on such an investment will likely go
unfulfilled, however! In the consumer electronics world we have to ask a
similar question. I can buy 1080p gear, but will I see the difference?
The answer to this question is a bit more ambiguous."

[0]Microsoft Delenda Est writes "After ACT, a Microsoft front group,

to anti-trust liability, eWeek has published [1]a rebuttal by Bruce
Perens. Aside from the fact that IBM, HP, Red Hat, and a couple dozen
corporate lawyers are watching over the creation of the GPLv3, there is
already precedent saying that shows the GPL is unlikely to give rise to
any significant liability — Daniel Wallace v. FSF. In that case, pro se
litigant Daniel Wallace was all but laughed out of the courtroom for
alleging the GPLv2 violates anti-trust law, and the GPLv3 clauses in
question are simply clarifications and extensions of clauses in the
GPLv2. Presumably, that is why the ACT neglected to cite any precedent
substantiating their allegations."

Bloomberg is reporting on the [0]publisher scramble for Wii titles,

they certainly weren't the only company that initially missed the bus.
"Electronic Arts wasn't the only publisher slow to see Wii's appeal. New
York-based Take-Two Interactive Software Inc., maker of Grand Theft Auto
games, had no Wii titles when the player was released and now plans to
have three this year, said spokesman Jim Ankner. Activision Inc., based
in Santa Monica, California, plans to release six Wii games this year,
giving the second-largest publisher a total of 11, said spokeswoman
Maryanne Lataif." Though that's great news for Wii gamers, the question
is: how many of these titles are going to be 'shovelware'?

[0]athloi wrote with a link to an Ars Technica article on a case
involving [1]the right to privacy on the internet. "A Welsh university
employee has successfully sued the UK government in the EU court of human
rights over monitoring of her personal internet use from work. According
to the complaint, the woman's e-mail, phone, Internet, and fax usage were
all monitored by the Deputy Principal (DP) of the college, who appears to
have taken a sharp dislike to her. The woman claimed that her human
rights were being abused, and pointed specifically to Article 8 of the
European Convention on Human Rights, which governs private and family
life." The courts agreed; despite a lack of a notion of 'privacy' in
English law, the EU convention forced their hand. The ruling doesn't try
to dissuade employers from monitoring employees, but does encourage them
to inform employees about surveillance.

[0]eldavojohn writes "The Indiana Court of Appeals has ruled that [1]a
judge violated the constitution after placing a juvenile on probation for
an expletive laden MySpace entry on the principal. The court decided that
the juvenile's free speech rights had been unconstitutionally revoked,
and the original judge had suppressed politically motivated free speech
since the comments were directly attacking school policy. I think we are
starting to see a fine line develop online as it did with print —
[2]bullying & slander are punishable while we have to allow criticism of
ideas no matter how harsh it is."

Dumpling$9 writes with a link to an article that seems to speak volumes
about the modern consumer relationship with service providers. IBT
reports on the [0]outrageous fees facing users who drop their internet
service contracts before they are up. "Pricing broadband competition can
be difficult. Broadband is rarely priced as a stand-alone service.
Whether offered by a telephone company or a cable company, it is usually
bundled with other services such as voice and video. The advantage to the
customer is easier billing and usually a price break. But the down side
is if they drop one of the services to pursue a better deal elsewhere,
they lose the discount ... It remains to be seen whether penalties for
Internet customers will cut down on churn. Consumers Union in its annual
cell phone survey found that nearly half of all cell phone subscribers
who were considering switching carriers were deterred from doing so
because of early termination penalties."

Foundation has jumped in on the defendant's side in a White Plains, New
York, court conflict. The case is [2]Lava v. Amurao, and the EFF will be
defending Mr. Amurao's right to counterclaim for copyright misuse. EFF
argued that the RIAA, by deliberately bringing meritless cases against
innocent people based on theories of 'secondary liability', are abusing
their copyrights. In [3]its amicus brief, EFF also decried (just as when
it [4]joined the ACLU, Public Citizen, and others on the side of Debbie
Foster in [5]Capitol v. Foster) the RIAA's 'driftnet' litigation
strategy. They argue that the declaratory judgment remedy must also be
made available to defendants, in view of the RIAA's habit of dropping the
meritless cases it started but can't finish."

brunascle writes "Researchers have devised a [0]new way to patch hardware.
By treating a computer chip more like software than hardware, Josep
Torrellas, a computer science professor from the University of Illinois
at Urbana Champaign, believes we will be able to fix defective hardware
by a applying a patch, similar to the way defective software is handled.
His system, dubbed Phoenix, consists of a standard semiconductor device
called a [1]field programmable gate array (FPGA). Although generally
slower than their application-specific integrated circuit counterparts,
FPGAs have the advantage of being able to be modified post-production.
Defects found on a Phoenix-enabled chip could be resolved by downloading
a patch and applying it to the hardware. Torrellas believes this would
give chips a shorter time to market, saying "If they know that they could
fix the problems later on, they could beat the competition to market.""
