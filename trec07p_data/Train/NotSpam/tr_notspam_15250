I see. Well, I've never heard this being called "callback". And seems 
Wikipedia agrees with me 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callback_%28computer_science%29

 callback = executable code that is passed as a parameter to other 
code 

What you are talking about is sometimes called "shelling out", but 
"running an OS command" or even better "running an external program" 
would work best.

You did not look hard enough.

There is Net::SMTP, MIME::Lite (this one allows sending both via and 
without an external program), Mail::Sender, Mail::Sendmail, ...
