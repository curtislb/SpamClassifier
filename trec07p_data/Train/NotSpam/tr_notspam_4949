Why do we need to depend on Perl for these features?

I think that it is very important for test infrastructure to be simple  
and transparent. It needs to have very low barriers to entry to get  
people to add tests and it needs to be very easy to run and to automate.

If moving to Perl helps achieve this, then I'm happy.
