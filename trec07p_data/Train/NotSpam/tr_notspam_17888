Train Your Brain

Learn These Three Money-Making Habits

My Favorite Brain Stock

==

When I was young, I wanted to be a brain expert . . .but I didn't
particularly like medicine.  What I've found more interesting and
intelligible over the years is psychology, and that's come in mighty handy
in the investing business.

Psychology, of course, is what moves stocks.  Sure, the media will pretend
that it's fundamentals that move stocks, but it's not. Fundamentals don't buy 
and sell stocks; people buy and sell stocks.  And people, as we all know, are 
not always rational.

But people can be taught!  Ideally, you get a great education when you're
young, because the younger you are, the more teachable you are.  But
there's no reason that you can't learn at any age, given sufficient
motivation and perseverance.

For this knowledge, we are indebted to those brain experts who did go
through medical school, and who continue to discover more about the
amazing bundle of nerves we carry inside our skull.

They tell us that when we're young, the brain is amazingly malleable, that
it's a cinch to learn French when you're six years old.  And they tell us
that as we age, learning new skills gets just a little bit harder every
year.

But we are always capable of learning, and what typically fades before the
ability to learn is the desire.  We get set in our ways.  We get comfortable.  
And we see little benefit to doing things differently than we've done before.

But I'm a strong believer in life-long learning.  And today I'm going to
give you three lessons on becoming a better investor.

Note: It won't do to just read the list and say, "Yeah, I'm going to do that."

To learn these habits, you have to practice them.  You have to put in the
time.  In essence, you have to train your brain to think in new patterns.

It's the same thing in any profession.

The more a baseball player takes batting practice, the more efficient he
makes the necessary connections in his brain, and the better his hand-eye
coordination, reflexes and more.  They call it muscle memory, but it all
happens in the brain.

The same is true of a piano player; he's using small muscles instead of
big muscles, and he's also using the part of the brain that recognizes,
tempo, pitch, tonality, rhythm and more.

It's true of the geologist interpreting seismic data in a hunt for oil.

And it's true of the mailman, who learns the names and addresses on his
route by simple repetition, whether he tries to or not.

In brief, all this learning happens because neurons in the brain produce
impulses, which carry tiny electrical currents. These currents cross the
synapses between neurons with chemical transporters called
neurotransmitters, and the more often the same paths are used, the more
efficient those pathways become.

Unfortunately, pathways left unused get progressively less efficient,
which is why if you've never learned a foreign language, you're going to
have a heck of a time doing it once you're past middle age.

So here are the three habits that will make you a better investor.

One - Learn to keep your losses small.

Think of investing as a pinball game at the arcade.  You pay an entry fee,
and as long as you have credits, you can continue playing.  If you're
good, your credits increase.  But if you fail to make the right moves, and
your credit drops to zero, you can't play anymore.  In the investing world, 
where the credits are real dollars, you never want that to happen.  So when 
the trend turns against you, you sell and take a loss.

When you take a loss, the world doesn't end.  You're left holding cash,
which is a very good thing, and that cash is the entry fee to the game's
next round.

Sure, taking losses means admitting you were wrong, and that's a tough
thing to do the first few times.  But with practice, your ego learns to
let go.  You accept that small losses are necessary if you're going to
have the entry fee for the next game.  And you learn to take losses
quickly and easily.

Look, for example, at Gateway (GTW), a stock that popped up on someone's
undervalued list recently.  With revenues of nearly $4 billion a year and
a market capitalization of just $638 million, it certainly appears
undervalued.  But you could have said that when the market cap was $2
billion, and then when it was $1 billion.

The trouble at Gateway, of course, is that the company has had trouble
growing.  It lost money in 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004.  And while it
returned to profitability in 2005, it still faces a raft of formidable
competitors in Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Apple, Sony and others.

If you had been holding Gateway at any time in the past seven years and
found yourself with a loss, selling quickly would have been the wisest
course.  Sure, sometimes stocks you sell bounce back and move on to new
highs.  That's life.  But lost opportunity is far less painful than lost
money.  So learn to sell quickly.

Two - Learn to look at charts.

We're all raised as fundamental thinkers, and thus most investors focus on
fundamentals, reasoning that if a company has growing revenues and
earnings, its stock should increase.

But stocks do not move on fundamentals alone.  They move because of hopes
and dreams, fear and greed.  This week, for example, fears of inflation
returned to the market, driving stocks down sharply.  Nothing has changed 
at most companies, yet most stocks are down.  That's fear at work.

And you can't ignore this.  What you should do, ideally on a daily basis,
is look at the charts of each one of your stocks to get a picture of how
they're performing.  It's not enough to look at a ledger and see that you
have a profit.  You want to see if the stocks are still in uptrends.  You
want to watch for signs of accumulation or distribution.  And if a stock
is no longer in an uptrend, and no longer under accumulation, you want to
think about getting rid of it.

Now, chart-reading is not easy.  And it's not a perfect science; there is
no perfection in investing.  But the more charts you look at, the more you
come to recognize the patterns and rhythms that matter.  We call it
"looking for familiar faces," or patterns that we've seen before that
usually lead to an upmove or a downmove.  Over time, charts become your
friends, and if you look at enough of them, over time, you'll one day find
that you are unable to buy a stock without first getting a good look at
its chart.

Three - Learn to imagine how big success might be achieved.

Over the years, some of Cabot's best winners have come from companies that
provided a revolutionary product or service to the mass market.   
A decade ago it was Amazon (AMZN), which started by selling books but
eventually came to sell almost everything.  If you had the foresight at
the beginning to see that possibility, you might have been an earlier
buyer of Amazon!

More recently (last October) the Cabot Market Letter recommended buying
Crocs (CROX), the maker of funny-looking shoes.  It served a mass market. 
Its products were revolutionary.  But could the company grow to be
something more than a maker of funny-looking shoes?   
Absolutely.  Crocs has been expanding its portfolio of shoes rapidly and
this week the company rolled out its fall line-up, featuring 13 new
models, including some that have a more traditional appearance and use
canvas, leather and shearling while retaining that trademark Crocs
comfort.

If you had imagined this brand expansion earlier, you might have been an
earlier buyer of Crocs!

Admittedly, it's not easy to think creatively about where companies might
go.  But when you do, you'll find that you can more easily justify
investing in revolutionary companies, and that's where some of the biggest
profits are made.  So practice it . . . starting today.   Look at each
stock in your portfolio and ask yourself, "What are the growth
opportunities for this company?"

With practice, you'll train your brain to more readily identify these big
profit-makers, and you'll find yourself being an early buyer of
revolutionary world-changing companies.

Looking For Steady Individual Stock Returns Of 124%... 169%... 103%...
189% And More?

Look no further than the Cabot Benjamin Graham Value Letter. It's the only
advisory in the country that applies the fundamental principals of
Benjamin Graham to stock picking.

Benjamin Graham, considered the father of value investing, taught his
wealth-building secrets to Warren Buffett, Mario Gabelli and John Neff
among others ... each of whom went on to establish fantastic fortunes.

Recent Value Letter winners include:

*  Total System Services (a processor of credit cards) up 56.4% in 17 months.
*  Reliance Steel (a metals wholesaler) up 32% in 12 months.
*  Exxon Mobil (you know who they are!) up 22% in 8 months.

In fact, since its inception at the end of 1995, Roy's Wise Owl Model has
racked up a compound annual return of 16.5% compared to 7.4% for the S&P
500. And the Classic Model is up 26.2% compounded since 2002, compared to
a gain of 8.4% by the Dow!

Speaking of practice, New York City was the location of the Pac-Man World
Championship this week, scheduled to promote the release of Pac-Man
Championship Edition for Xbox 360.  Pac-Man has been around for 28 years,
and remains one of the most popular video games of all time.  And it's an
activity (it's hard to call it a career) that certainly requires practice.
 The victor was 27-year-old Carlos Daniel Borrego Romero from Mexico.  His
prize?  A new Xbox and one free sandwich a week from Quiznos, for 26
years!

Getting back to the brain . . . today, most medicines that target brain
function are digested in the stomach, and then must work their way through
the bloodstream to the brain; it's a rather indirect route, to say the
least.  But back on May 3, I wrote about a drug company that was working
on transport mechanisms to deliver drugs through the blood-brain barrier.

The company is Xenoport (XNPT), and it had recently earned a spot in Cabot
Top Ten Report after its stock shot up from 28 to 42.  The reason for the
strength?  The company reported that a test of its drug to treat restless
leg syndrome (RLS) had yielded promising results.

Now, this company has never sold a single product and never made a single
dime, so it is definitely a speculation.

But I thought it worth mentioning then -  and now - because I think
Xenoport has huge potential.  I can imagine (as suggested above) that the
company will have great success by introducing many drugs that penetrate
directly to the brain.

So I'm keeping an eye on it . . . by looking at the chart.

Back on May 3, I wrote, "if you're in the mood for an aggressive
speculation, you can take a small position here . . .today, the stock is
still at 42, having pulled back slightly from last Thursday's high of
44."

Well, since then it's been up to 45 and back down to 41.  We call this
"building a base."  As long as the stock holds above 40, the base remains
intact.  But if it falls below 40, the next support level is 37, where we
find the 50-day moving average, and that's not quite as attractive.

If you're interested, keep an eye on it along with me.
