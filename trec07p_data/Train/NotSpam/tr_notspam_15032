04:17 PM, 05/31/07, Update: Flight readiness review concludes; Atlantis 'go=
' for June 8 launch=20

NASA managers today wrapped up a two-day flight readiness review and cleare=
d the shuttle Atlantis and its seven-member crew for blastoff June 8, at 7:=
38 p.m., on a hail-delayed mission to deliver a new set of solar arrays to =
the international space station.

"We had a very good review over the past day and half," said Bill Gerstenma=
ier, director of space operations at NASA headquarters. "I have two things =
I'd like to announce. First, we've set the launch date for June 8 at 7:38 i=
n the evening. And the second thing is that there was no hail storm the eve=
ning before the meeting began."

Launch originally was scheduled for March 15, but the flight was delayed in=
 the wake of a freak hail storm Feb. 26 - the day before the original fligh=
t readiness review - that caused major damage to foam insulation protecting=
 the shuttle's external tank. That damage has now been repaired, and shuttl=
e Program Manager Wayne Hale said there are no other major issues to be res=
olved.

"We have a team, particularly in the external tank area, that was hit with =
this unforeseen and unexpected occurrence of the hail storm," he said. "In =
spite of a great deal of work that had to be done, they accomplished it in =
a very professional manner. ... We are extremely confident, we have done pe=
rfectly good repairs and we will have a tank that is safe to fly."

The primary goals of mission STS-117 are to deliver a new crew member - Cla=
yton Anderson - to the space station; to install a $367 million set of sola=
r arrays and a powerful rotary joint to help them track the sun; and to com=
plete the retraction of another set of arrays so it can be moved later this=
 year.

Three spacewalks are planned and the crew is prepared to stage a fourth, su=
pplies permitting, if they run into problems retractiong the P6 array.

The work is a critical step in a sequence of three shuttle flights to build=
 up the station's electrical power system and clear the way for the long-aw=
aited attachment of European and Japanese research modules late this year a=
nd early next.

At the controls aboard Atlantis will be commander Frederick Sturckow, pilot=
 Lee Archambault and flight engineer Steven Swanson. Their crewmates are Pa=
trick Forrester, James Reilly, John "Danny" Olivas and Anderson, who will r=
eplace astronaut Sunita Williams aboard the space station.

The astronauts are scheduled to fly to the Kennedy Space Center from Housto=
n Monday evening, arriving around 6:30 p.m. If all goes well, engineers wil=
l begin Atlantis' countdown at 9 p.m. Tuesday.

"The processing out at the launch pad is going extremely well," said Launch=
 Director Mike Leinbach. "We got our ordnance on board the ship last night,=
 we'll be pressurizing our hypergolic and MPS (main propulsion system) tank=
s over the weekend, we have one more round of battery charging for the payl=
oad and we'll be ready to pick up the launch countdown Tuesday night.

"The team is really pumped to get this done this time," he said. "We've end=
ured three months of down time due to the hail storm and the recovery from =
that. ... Team, Atlantis is ready to go and we'll look forward to launch ne=
xt Friday night."

Atlantis' launch period extends through July 19. But a Lockheed Martin Atla=
s 5 rocket carrying a classified National Reconnaissance Office payload is =
scheduled for launch from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station the morning =
of June 14.

NASA can make four attempts to launch Atlantis over a five-day period - Jun=
e 8-12 - before standing down for the Atlas and to top off on-board supplie=
s of hydrogen and oxygen. The shuttle launch period would reopen on June 17=
, regardless of whether the Atlas went on June 14 or 15.

Assuming Atlantis gets off on time, however, the shuttle will dock with the=
 space station around 3:40 p.m. on June 10. Landing back at the Kennedy Spa=
ce Center is targeted for June 19 at around 2:44 p.m. A detailed timeline i=
s available on the CBS News STS-117 Quick-Look page.
