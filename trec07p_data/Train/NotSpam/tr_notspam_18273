Hi,

gnome-lokkit would be a better candidate instead, but looks dead
upstream (last GNOME upload was in 2002) and is gtk+1 only. If someone
steps in with a new candidate or update gnome-lokkit, I would be glad
to reconsider.

Btw, do you have any removals suggestions? :) Replace candidates are
also ok, considering that we want more features and less resource
hungry software for Lenny (including disk, cpu and memory).
