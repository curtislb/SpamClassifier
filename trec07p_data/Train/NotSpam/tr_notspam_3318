Please read this link again:

http://lists.ibiblio.org/pipermail/cc-community/2007-April/001702.html

and consider the phrase therein:

"If you use the work in another work where a copyright arises"

(and respond to it in its own right if you would be so kind)

Any container situation where there is no copyright on the container as a work 
will not cause this to kick in. That gets rid of a lot of your above 
concerns, right?

I also speak to the siblings in the container where the container gets a 
copyright as well.

Again:

"In cases where no copyright would arise from putting the BY-SA work together 
with other works, none of this would apply."

So siblings are in the clear totally where no copyright arises on the 
container as a work.

There would be no attempt to force the siblings in the container to carry the 
exact same license under any circumstances since they are not derivatives, 
only derivatives are derivatives. ~;-) You would use the right to copy 
provisions to specify OK licenses for siblings in the container which has a 
copyright and not try and control siblings at all where the container does 
not get a copyright. (I even propose relaxing the sync provisions for 
sounds/video if this can work.)

Could be, but does it have to be?

I think we can do better. Like I have said before in other situations, it is 
early days yet and we have a lot of thinking and experimenting to do yet.
