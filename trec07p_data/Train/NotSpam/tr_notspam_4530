I don't think it'll work in this case because \x99 doesn't seem to be 
inside my list of iso-8859-1 characters.

The document Mr. Cox is downloading is less than truthful about its 
character set. Although it advertises itself as iso-8859-1, it's 
actually cp1250.

Mr. Cox, I got your program to decode the text properly by changing the 
decoding line to this:

my $name1 = decode( 'cp1250', $name );

Have a nice day.

BTW, I got the list of valid cp1250 characters here: 
http://www.microsoft.com/typography/unicode/1250.htm

Read "perldoc Encode::Supported" to see the list of supported character 
sets.
