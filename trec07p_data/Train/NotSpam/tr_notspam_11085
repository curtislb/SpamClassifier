Hello sm1lies,

This is a reminder that TopCoder Marathon Match 17 is now underway.  TopCoder Marathon Matches provide a flexible competition format with an extended timeline that offers different types of problems than what can be offered in a traditional TopCoder algorithm round.  These competitions are a bit more leisurely than the traditional TopCoder algorithm competitions and will allow you to spend as much or as little time as you'd like - whenever you'd like.

The current competition has recently started and will run through May 30, 2007.  Check out the standings and register here: 
http://www.topcoder.com/longcontest/?module=ViewActiveContests

You may register at any time during the competition.

TopCoder also provides practice Marathon Match style problems here:

Best of luck to you!
