Hello,
to prepare a (non-technical or -mathematical) txt-file for use with tex, i have
to replace a few things: umlauts, underscores, special characters and so on. 

My problem:
I also want to replace quotions, depending whether they are at the beginning or
the end of a word. For example "tick" should become ``tick''. Annoyingly, my script just
gives me ``$1ic$1''. Any ideas?

regards
tannhauser


use strict;
use warnings;

my $t = " \"tick\" "; 
#all replacements are in %h, 
#i took out the working ones.
my %h = ( '(\w)"\s+?' => '$1\'\'',  
           '\s+?"(\w)' => '``$1' ); 
   
while ((my $old, my $new) = each (%h)) {
    $t =~ s/$old/$new/g;
    }  
print $t;
