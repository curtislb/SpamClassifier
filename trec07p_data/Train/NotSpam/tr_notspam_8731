What does 'bombs' mean, and what does 'freeze' mean (the posting guide 
asks you not to use such imprecise language)?  My guess is that the R 
process is running at ~100% of the CPU and not returning to the top-levl 
prompt nor is it interruptible.

If so, I believe you will find it is inside the Fortran code.  (I think I 
have seen similar examples in the past, which is why I tend not to use 
tripack, not akima which has also misbehaved.)

Have you sent the problem to the package maintainer?
