I have my subscriptions file set up to store individual podcasts in their 
own directories below the date directories.  This works well most of the 
time except that yesterday I heard a message saying the system was trying 
to delete one of those directories and the system had failed since as 
happens sometimes things that are supposed to store themselves in 
directories actually use the names chosen for those directories but end up 
being podcasts themselves.  Maybe external bittorrent couldn't figure out 
my structure and messed up with its deletes.  Interestingly what it tried 
to delete had already been delivered that same day.  I don't know if this 
is normal podracer behavior or something beyond normal.
