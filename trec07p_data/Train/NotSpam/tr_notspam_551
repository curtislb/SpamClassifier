LARRY'S THE DADDY!
Showbiz Tonight can tell you that Larry Birkhead is the father
of Anna Nicole Smith's baby, Dannielynn. The ruling was made by
a Bahamian court late today, Tuesday. Showbiz Tonight was right
there as Birkhead came out of the court and said "I told you
so!" A DNA test confirmed him as the father with 99.99 percent
certainty. Howard K. Stern, who had insisted he was the father,
said he would not fight Birkhead for custody.

We're in the Bahamas, and will have reaction from all of the
players in this Anna Nicole saga, including Anna's mom, Virgie
Arthur, Anna's half-sister, Donna and Larry Birkhead's former
attorney, Debra Opri.

Be sure to tune into Showbiz Tonight, 11pm ET/PT on CNN
Headline News, for the latest and most complete coverage of
this developing story!
