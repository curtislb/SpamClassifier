gmail account does really good at filtering spam into a "spam" folder where 
spam is auto deleted once it's 30 days old.

It's what I do, have/use a gmail account for this list.  I just use the gmail 
with my pop3 email client of preference which for me is the rather powerful 
Kmail since Kmail is in KDE and I use the Linux KDE desktop.

Some weeks that go by, 2 or 3 spam get past and make it to my Kmail.  Other 
weeks, no spam whatsoever makes it to my Kmail.  Ocasionally I log onto www 
gmail and "report" spam (the very very very few spam that didn't already get 
put into the spam folder).

And, yes, the newsgroup post made it to the list -- made it to my gmail 
account and got to my Kmail on my Linux KDE desktop.
