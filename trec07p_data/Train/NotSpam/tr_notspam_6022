Cygwin is a Unix environment emulated in Windows.  Paths on Unix are
done by slash  eg /data/scripts/xyz.pl,  this represents (typically) C:
\cygwin\data\scripts\xyz.pl.

To convert between Windows paths and cygwin paths use cygpath command
line tool,  may be a function in perl as well.

For paths to files you can use the cygwin UNC
paths.  //c/some/where/on/C/drive/xyz.pl or //server/share/directory

Activestate is a perl implementation that is straight windows if you
like.  This might be a better fit to your task.
