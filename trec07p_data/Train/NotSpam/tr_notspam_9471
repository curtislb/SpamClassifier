GENEVA -- The Sixtieth World Health Assembly (WHA) will take place from

variola virus stocks; malaria, including proposal for establishment of
Malaria Day; tuberculosis control: progress and long-term planning;

resolutions recommended by the WHO Executive Board on these and other
issues.

The agenda, the daily Journal and other WHA documents can be found at

French, Russian and Spanish. Below is a list of agenda items and other
