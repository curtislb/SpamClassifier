  I haven't received a reply yet, and now that parliament is in recess I
don't know if we are stuck waiting.  See the BLOG if you didn't know
about parliament being in recess until September 17, 2007.
  http://www.digital-copyright.ca/node/4021

  If anyone knows any details of where to get documents tabled in the
house, such as replies to petitions, this would be great!  We've needed
to request these from MPs in the past, noticing the replies ourselves
(seems MPs aren't informed when the petitions they table have a reply).


  Speculation, but in September there might be a new session of
parliament started (*), which is why I'm waiting to have the signatures
I have at the moment tabled.  I want to make sure that we have
signatures tabled in each session, and thus they show up in every
journal index.



(* - off topic for this list) Bill C-30 still exists, and even though
government trusted economists have stated in reports given to the
government that even the Green Party carbon tax plan would be good for
the economy long term, they still want to kill the lesser carbon budget
in C-30 http://www.greenparty.ca/en/node/2074   Bad fiscal managers when
they let closed minded ideology trump both natural and social scientific
evidence.

  When I look at the Journals I can see document identifiers of things
such as replies tabled in the house to petitions.  Are these published
online?


Example:

Technical Protection Measures (TPM)

      >>Petitions
      >>>(Angus), (391-1311), 1172, gr, 1356 (8545-391-12-04)
No. 391-1311 concerning the Copyright Act. — Sessional Paper No.
8545-391-12-04;


And also:

Copyright

      >>Creators/public rights
      >>>Petitions
      >>>>(Angus), (391-0575), 628, gr, 894 (8545-391-12-02)
      >>>>(Hanger), (391-1176), 1043, gr, 1203 (8545-391-12-03)
      >>>>(Rajotte), (391-0026), 60, gr, 229 (8545-391-12-01)


Thank you.
