Hello sm1lies,

We thought you'd like to know about four new development projects. Related to a new survey application, these components share a number of similarities -- and with accelerated timelines and high prizes, they're a great opportunity to complete multiple projects at once and take a large share of the $2,250 in prize money. 

Here are the projects and their first-place prizes. For more details on each, see below.
 
* Java Survey Persistence ($800)
* Java Survey Content ($600)
* Java Survey Manager ($500)
* Java Survey Servlet ($600)

Component details:

* Survey Persistence: Provides standard CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete) operations for entities defined in the Survey Model component.  The component provides a pluggable persistence interface and an implementation for Microsoft SQL Server 2005.

* Survey Content: Generates dynamic content based on pre-defined messages and rules. These messages can include fixed text from a configuration file or dynamic text from Responses in the Session object.  This component will be used to displayed user-customized content in a survey.

* Survey Manager: Stores Surveys, which are each made up of any number of Pages.  Each page contains questions, dynamic content, attributes, validation requirements and UI style information.  This is a simple component that provides the Survey/Page model classes and logic for creating these objects from a configuration file.

* Survey Servlet: The Survey Servlet component provides a web-based front end for the application.  It utilizes the other components for the bulk of the logic and primarily implements the UI logic ï¿½ such as question presentation, response parsing and response validation.


Good luck!
