I am commencing a gather of video footage for the user-generated 
documentary to accompany the A Swarm of Angels open movie project ( 
http://www.aswarmofangels.com/ ).

I am finalising a release form for members to include as part of their 
uploaded media to the project. This is not a public submission so I 
don't foresee any problems regarding permissions with the media, but I 
would like it covered legally for the project, and to also to reassure, 
and ensure the rights of, uploaders.

I'd welcome comment on this text to its adequacy etc, and any 
suggestions for modification.
