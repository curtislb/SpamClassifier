						<b>HILLARY CLINTON</b>
<br>

<br>
As I write, we have a packed programme including the first British intervie=
w with Carl Bernstein about his new book A Woman In Charge: The Life of Hil=
lary Rodham Clinton. He spent six years writing and researching it and it i=
s published amidst a slew of books on the Clintons. In it he alleges she ha=
s suffered from depression, and that Hillary and Bill Clinton, decades ago,=
 devised a strategy for a husband two term presidency followed by the same =
for his wife.=20
<br>

<br>
The book makes clear the energy and effort that went into devising strategi=
es to deal with Bill Clinton's infidelities, but are they continuing? I'll =
also be asking Carl Bernstein why, when there is a feeling in America that =
the Democrats should win, when Hillary Clinton is put in the frame the mood=
 changes.
<br>
=20
<br>
<b>G8</b>
<br>

<br>
The G8 pulled more aid for Africa out of the hat before the world leaders w=
ent their separate ways - or did they?=20=20
<br>

<br>
Bob Geldof has called the summit a farce. There seems to be some disagreeme=
nt as to whether new money has been pledged by countries that were falling =
behind in their promise to deliver by 2010, or whether the new drive to boo=
st the fight against Aids and provide free schooling for all African childr=
en is a reassignment of existing donations.=20
<br>

<br>
We hope to have the definitive answer tonight. We're hoping to speak to Bob=
 Geldof. And we'll be asking the  International Development Secretary, Hila=
ry Benn, what exactly have the G8 countries signed up to on Africa?
<br>
=20
<br>
<B>GB TOUR</b>
<br>

<br>
Paul Mason brings us his next instalment of the Zombie Brown Grand Tour. We=
'll be watching his progress through the north east of England, the heartla=
nds of traditional Labour values, to find out what they are expecting to ha=
ppen when the Brown boat comes in.=20=20=20=20=20=20=20=20=20=20=20=20=20

And then I'm joined for Newsnight Review by Johann Hari, Rachel Holmes, Jon=
athan Freedland and Anthony Horowitz.=20=20
<br>

<br>
<b>MEMORY ALMOST FULL by PAUL McCARTNEY</b>
<br>

<br>
We review Paul McCartney's new album - Memory Almost Full. It's named for t=
he text that pops up on your mobile phone and just to reinforce the fact th=
at the former Beatle is fully conversant in new technology, he is now part =
of the YouTube generation, where you can see snippets of conversation with =
Macca, his pop video and rehearsal sessions.=20
<br>

<br>
The swish CD is also his first release away from EMI and into the coffee ho=
uses - it's the debut album on the Starbucks label Hear Music. The music it=
self mines his past, his childhood, Liverpool and summers gone he says, as =
well as his writing days with John Lennon.=20
<br>

<br>
<b>MICHAEL TOLLIVER LIVES by ARMISTEAD MAUPIN</b>
<br>

<br>
Armistead Maupin first introduced us to the liberal gay San Francisco scene=
 in the late 70's with the start of his Tales From The City series.  Now ov=
er 20 years on, he and we are revisiting some of his favourite characters -=
 most important of all Michael Tolliver, in Maupin's new novel, Michael Tol=
liver Lives. Michael, the gay gardener, now in his 50s, lives with HIV and =
is married to a much younger partner. Their lives are bound up with biologi=
cal family - Christian fundamentalists - and a "logical family" gay, straig=
ht, transgenerational and transexual with whom they work, rest and play.=20
<br>

<br>
<b>THE DROWSY CHAPERONE</b>
<br>

<br>
The first smash hit musical out of Toronto is some accolade, but The Drowsy=
 Chaperone is just that - now in London's West End, by way of Broadway wher=
e it picked up five Tony Awards.
<br>

<br>
The star billing goes to Elaine Paige who plays the sozzled spinster of the=
 title, but the middle aged, cardiganed, musical-loving geek in the armchai=
r at the corner of the stage is a star too. Played by Bob Martin, who also =
co-wrote the book, The Man in the Chair takes us through The Drowsy Chapero=
ne, a parody of a 20's musical with wit and charm.=20
<br>

<br>
<b>HELIO OITICICA: THE BODY OF COLOUR</b>
<br>

<br>
The Brazilian artist Helio Oiticica was a leader of the modernist avant-gar=
de art movement in his country in the 60s and 70s and was obsessed with col=
our until his premature death in 1980. His inspiration was artists such as =
Malevich, Klee and Mondrian but he went further in his desire to liberate c=
olour into space.=20=20
<br>

<br>
Now Tate Modern is holding the first major UK exhibition of his work in 35 =
years entitled The Body of Colour - including work the Tate has recently ac=
quired. The exhibition reveals Oiticica's belief that colour could be exper=
ienced through collage, sculpture, poetry, painting, installation and most =
gloriously - specifically in work called Parangole - in dance when the danc=
er becomes the colour.
