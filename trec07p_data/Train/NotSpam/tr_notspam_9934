I think they are ;-)

I don't think that there is space for the changes you are implying in
the following paragraphs. Small changes are acceptable, of course.

Right ;-)

I disagree: The make it look ugly, but not hard to read.

Well, most of them are gone or renamed to more readable ones in p6.

Most people don't ;-).

Well, if you like the python way, feel free to code in python.
Perhaps some day it will be possible to mix them:

use python;
# Write python code here

Don't get me wrong, there's nothing bad in writing some critics, but
yours is impossible to realize in Perl 6, and therefore are it's hard to
call it constructive.
