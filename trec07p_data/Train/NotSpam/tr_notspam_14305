You don't find the kernel sources shipped with grml. You have to
install them manually.

Yes.

Did you maybe configure your network via /etc/network/interfaces (or
grml-network) and didn't set CONFIG_DHCP='no' in
/etc/grml/autoconfig on the other hand?

But *please*: do not use grml if you don't know how to handle
Debian unstable, really.

Using grml-debootstrap it's simple and easy to get a plain Debian
system, including grml's kernel as an option. If I have the time
I'll maybe work on some further magic so you can get swspeak without
any manual tweaking with a plain Debian (stable) system.
