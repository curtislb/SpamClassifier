No, no. If I remember rightly where this came from...

The deal is this:

Providing music in a different "package" so to speak.

Instead of a CD with multiple songs, or singles, provide a bootable DVD (CD if 
there is enough room) with a multitrack ardour project file, ardour and other 
needed tools and the underlying OS. Plop the cd in, boot from it, up comes 
ardour with the song loaded, with jamin and effects and the rest all hooked 
up and routed in qjackctl and playing automatically.

At this point, the user has a load of freedom. Stop playback, record a new 
lead vocal and mut the original lead and play the piece with his own vocal.

Backing vocal, guitar solo, whatever.

Or just do a different mixdown with the same original tracks.

Or...

Well, I would want to get a body of Free work created for this purpose. And 
being Free, all distributions would be able to do whatever with them.

Is that explained in a partially understandable fashion?

Well, if we are talking the same thing, I had no thoughts of backing. 
Naturally, non-disruptive backing would be a good thing.
