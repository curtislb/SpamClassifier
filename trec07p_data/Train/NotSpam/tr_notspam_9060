[0]eldavojohn writes "Scientists in China have announced [1]finding the
gene that makes us human. The article explains that prior work has shown
that humans, as compared with the great apes from which we diverged over
5 million years ago, have a longer form of a protein (type II neuropsin)
located in the pre-frontal cortex of the brain. From the article: 'Gene
sequencing revealed a mutation specific to humans that triggers a change
in the splicing pattern of the neuropsin gene, creating a new splicing
site and a longer protein. Introducing this mutation into chimpanzee DNA
resulted in the creation of type II neuropsin. "Hence, the human-specific
mutation is not only necessary but also sufficient in creating the novel
splice form," the authors state.' The team is urging further analysis of
the extra 45 amino acids in type II neuropsin since they believe that
chain may cause protein structural and functional changes. The research
didn't link anything with this protein, simply identifying it as a very
distinct difference between us and our closest cousins."

An anonymous reader writes "Vice Adm. Robert Murrett, director of the
[0]National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, says that the increasing
availability of commercial satellite photos [1]may require the government
to restrict distribution. 'I could certainly foresee circumstances in
which we would not want imagery to be openly disseminated of a sensitive
site of any type, whether it is here or overseas,' he said. This would
include imagery on Web sites such as Google Earth, because the companies
that supply the photos get help from the NGIA with launches." I had never
heard of this particular intelligence agency. During the early months of
the invasion of Afghanistan they bought up all satellite imagery over
that country, worldwide, in a tactic later dubbed "checkbook shutter
control."

News for a post on how [1]privatization can affect access to research
material. The blog tells how a Harvard researcher on the history of
nuclear secrecy was denied access that would have been granted in the
past. Some followup is in the [2]comments to this reposting of the FAS
story. "Los Alamos National Laboratory will no longer permit historians
and other researchers to have access to its archival records because Los
Alamos National Security (LANS), the private contractor that now operates
the Lab, says it has 'no policy in place' that would allow such access."

Photobucket and Myspace, which have previously had disputes over

fall through. 'While hardly known outside the youthful world of social
network sites, Photobucket has become wildly popular with users for
providing free, online storage tools for multimedia self-expression, from
photos to videos to digital slideshows. Site builders turn to it for
images to decorate their sites. The four-year-old startup, based in Palo

[0]mdsolar writes "The LA Time reports that California is seeing a big
[1]drop off in rebate applications for solar power systems. It seems that
to get a rebate you have to also switch to a time of use rate with your
utility. The math is not working out, especially for smaller systems that
don't fully cover use during peak hours. The result: homeowners are
reluctant to go with solar energy. 'The difference between peak and
off-peak rates is particularly large in the 11 counties of Central,
coastal and Southern California, where Edison provides electricity
service to 13 million customers. Edison charges summer time-of-use rates
that range from 29.7 to 35.9 cents per kilowatt-hour between 10 a.m. and
6 p.m. on weekdays. It drops to a range of 16.3 to 18.6 cents per
kilowatt-hour from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. weekdays and all weekend days and
holidays, according to documents filed with the PUC.' There is likely an
optimal system size that reduces consumer costs, but with things in flux
you'd want some flexibility in your system."

allowing much more capacity enabling a data download speed of 150
megabits per second, or roughly 25 times faster than today's standard
cable modems. 'The new cable technology is crucial because the industry
is competing with a speedy new offering called FiOS, a TV and Internet

megabits per second, but the network already is capable of providing 100

stages are carrying bacteria from Earth to interstellar space. For
example, four upper rocket stages were used to boost deep space probes
Voyager 1, Voyager 2, Pioneer 10 and New Horizons. The spacecraft were
sterilized, but the rocket stages were not, and they now carry the
bacteria of the engineers who handled them. If the rocket stages hit a
habitable planet, and the bacteria survive the journey, they would be
able to reproduce and colonize the planet ... not that there's a high
liklihood of that. 'In 40,000 years, this wayward 185-pound (84 kilogram)
lump of metal will pass by the star AC+79 3888 at a distance of 1.64
light-years. ... Given the sheer expanse of time that lies ahead of the
four discarded rockets, at least one is likely to eventually encounter a
planet. But even if that planet's environment is conducive to life, the
long dormant bacteria will not just gently plop into some exotic ocean.
No soft landing can be expected.'"

released today reveals that cars with traffic flow sensors built into

[2]'intelligent' car that communicates with the highway or other cars is
an old idea, but the idea of them using sensors to anticipate braking
could vastly reduce fossil fuel consumption. From the article, 'Under the
US and European cycles, hybrid-matching fuel economy was reached with a
look-ahead predictability of less than 60 seconds. If the predictability
was boosted to 180 seconds, the newly-intelligent car was 33 percent more
fuel-efficient than when it was unconverted.' Now, the real question will
be whether or not you can convince consumers that the three minutes of
coasting up to a red light or halted traffic is worth the 33 percent less
gas and replacing your brake pads/cylinders less often."

[0]Pikoro asks: "I have been working in the IT field for the past 20
years or so, and after getting hired by the largest financial company in
the world, I thought I might have finally found a place to retire from.
However, after working here for almost a year, I find myself, not exactly
burnt out, but longing for a complete career field change. It's not that
doing IT related tasks aren't fun anymore, but they have become more
'work' than 'play' over the last few years. Since all of my experience
has been IT related, I'm not sure where I could go from here. What would
you consider doing for a living, after being in a single field for so
long?"

[0]Michael J. Ross writes "Database programmers using MySQL frequently
have a need to verify the name or parameter list of a MySQL function, or
to check a statement or the data types available within its
implementation of SQL. This typically occurs when the programmer is
caught up in a coding session, and would much rather not break their
creative flow by searching Web sites for the needed information, or
stepping away from their computer to hunt for a reference book. In these
cases, nothing could be more valuable than a concise summary of all SQL
statements and MySQL functions, in a form compact enough to be kept
within reach on the desk or tacked up to the nearest wall space. This is
the goal of the VisiBone MySQL Cards and Charts." Read on for the rest of
Michael's review.

An anonymous reader writes to mention that a recent University of
Minnesota study suggests that [0]ceiling height may affect
problem-solving skills. "'When people are in a room with a high ceiling,
they activate the idea of freedom. In a low-ceilinged room, they activate
more constrained, confined concepts.' Either can be good. The concept of
freedom promotes information processing that encourages greater variation
in the kinds of thoughts one has, said Meyers-Levy, professor of
marketing at the University of Minnesota. The concept of confinement
promotes more detail-oriented processing."

[0]coondoggie writes to tell us the Washington Post is reporting that new
legislation in a numbers of states and the District of Columbia allows
consumers to place a "[1]security freeze" on their credit files. "For the
millions of consumers who receive notice each year that their personal or
financial data was lost or stolen, a preemptive security freeze can offer
peace of mind. It blocks businesses and potential fraudsters from gaining
access to a consumer's credit report and score and from granting new
lines of credit in the consumer's name. In many states, consumers who
want to remove the freeze can use a special identification number to
unlock access to their credit file."

OriginalArlen writes "UniverseToday reports new research which suggests
dark matter could have [0]condensed to form 'dark stars' in the early
universe. These stars would have been very massive and burned very
slowly, fueled by non-fusion reactions, they could still be with us.
Astronomers hope to better constrain theories of early galaxy and star
formation with observations of gravitational lensing events caused by
these ghosts of the primordial universe."

among others. Vendors have time to submit their machines including
documentation and source code until July 1st or face severe restrictions,
