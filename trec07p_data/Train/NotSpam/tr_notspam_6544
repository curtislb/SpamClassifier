SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: As requested by the USTR, the Commission will
prepare a report as specified in section 2104(f)(2)-(3) of the Trade Act
of 2002 assessing the likely impact of the U.S. FTA with Korea on the
U.S. economy as a whole and on specific industry sectors, including the
impact the agreement will have on the gross domestic product, exports,
and imports; aggregate employment and employment opportunities; the
production, employment, and competitive position of industries likely to
be significantly affected by the agreement; and the interests of U.S.
consumers.

In preparing its assessment, the Commission will review available
economic assessments regarding the agreement, including literature
concerning any substantially equivalent proposed agreement. The
Commission will provide a description of the analyses used and
conclusions drawn in such literature, and a discussion of areas of
consensus and divergence between the Commission’s analyses and
conclusions and other economic assessments reviewed.

Section 2104(f)(2) requires that the Commission submit its report to the
President and the Congress not later than 90 days after the President
enters into the agreement, which he can do 90 days after he notifies the
Congress of his intent to do so. On April 1, 2007, the President
notified the Congress of his intent to enter into a FTA with Korea. The
USTR requested that the Commission provide the report as soon as
possible after the FTA is signed.

information concerning whether the hearing will be held.

All written submissions must conform with the provisions of section

document is requested, at least four (4) additional copies must be
filed, in which the confidential business information must be deleted
(see the following paragraph for further information regarding

conform with the requirements of section 201.6 of the Commission’s Rules
of Practice and Procedure (19 C.F.R. 201.6). Section 201.6 of the rules
requires that the cover of the document and the individual pages be

“nonconfidential” version, and that the confidential business
information be clearly identified by means of brackets. All written
submissions, except for confidential business information, will be made
available in the Office of the Secretary to the Commission for
inspection by interested parties.

The Commission intends to prepare only a public report in this
investigation. The report that the Commission sends to the President and
the Congress and makes available to the public will not contain
confidential business information. Any confidential business information
received by the Commission in this investigation and used in preparing
the report will not be published in a manner that would reveal the
