[ turning on gc]

Alas, no.  Today I couldn't get stm/llqueue_2.pir to hang.  It just exited 
with a "PANIC:  Out of mem" error with or without your suggested patch.  
I have no idea what that means.  And if I can't pin it down any better 
than that, I don't exepct there's much you can do, unless it's failing for 
you too.

Unfortunately not.  It made no difference.  That one still just hangs 
unless, of course, you run it in under the debugger, in which case it 
completes just fine.  Naturally.  Sigh.
