That is why (I think) the original proposal by Nathanael included the
sentence "but that is not a trademark license and should not be
construed as one".
Does this clarification prevent the misinterpretation you're afraid
about?

Heh, I've heard of a good number of absurd judgments.  I cannot be sure
a judge or jury will agree with me, but that holds for any other matter,
unfortunately...  :-(=20

I see, but then why not adding other useless restrictions as well?
Licenses for Free Software should be legally sound, but also as simple
and easy to understand as possible.

That same person could modify the fish into the logo of Red Hat, Inc.,
then put that on his own CD-ROMs with OSes, which he then sells.  Now
what?  Should we add a restriction to prevent this?  And then to prevent
the same with the logo of Sun Microsystems?  Of Microsoft Corporation?=20
Of Adobe Systems Inc.?  Of ...?

But companies do distribute images, and (only sometimes, sigh!) in a
DFSG-free manner.  Their licenses do not usually include a restriction
that prevents the licensee to derive a modified image that is
confusingly similar to the company logo (and then use it in commerce to
cause confusion as to the affiliation, etc.).

I mean: when the image is not confusingly similar to a logo, I think
it's awkward to add a restriction to the copyright license to prevent
trademark infringing uses of modified images...

I'm not sure I follow you here: what do you hope in a lawsuit?  That the
jury *disagrees* with you?
