It's an opinion.

That's not a way of documenting things, it's "just" an interface to
existing documentation. It provides no semantic search featurewhatsoever,
and can't, because Perl's documentation wasn't built like that.

The documentation for CGI is very different from the documentation for
IO::Socket::INET, although both are (can be) OO.

That's okay if you read the things like a book, but structured
documentation with structured interfaces allow readers to more easily
use the documentation for reference.

Sure, but it's a huge chicken-egg problem that doesn't have to exist.

I disagree very strongly.
