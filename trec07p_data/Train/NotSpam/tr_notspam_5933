Dimitri:

Several of us early Vista users have encountered difficulties that
ultimately were related to Vista's treating only the Administrator as having
permission to make some changes.  Even if you are the only user, you still
do not have administrative privileges by default.  (I think this is a good
thing since it diminishes accidental or malicious changes). 

With R the problem surfaces when trying to install packages.  The problem is
easily mitigated by running R as the administrator and installing the
packages or updates.  (Subsequent R sessions can be run by double clicking
on the icon, as usual.)  To do that, right-click on the program's icon and
choose "Run as administrator."  Perhaps this will solve your RWinEdt
problems as well.

Best wishes!

Subject: [R] RWinEdt and Windows Vista

Hi,

I have a new computer with Windows Vista and I am trying to use
RWinEdt, which I have always used. I am using R version 2.5.

The installation of the RWinEdt library is funny. First, it didn't
install at all. Then, I uninstalled/reinstalled both R and WinEdt,
downloaded the package again from the CRAN repositary, got some error
messages, but RWinEdt initialized. I closed R and WinEdt, launched R
again, type "library(RWinEdt)", and got several dialogue boxes
(again), asking if I wanted to creat shortcuts, etc. Then, RWinEdt
didn't work anymore.

I'm sorry for the messy email, but I've done so many
installations/uninstallations/re installations, that I am alos
confused.

I guess the ultimate questions is: are there any known issued between
R, RWinEdt and Windows Vista?

I appreciate any help.
Thanks,
Dimitri
