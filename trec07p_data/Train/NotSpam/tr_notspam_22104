Hello Keith,

I quite don't understand your reason for refusing running CVS code. 
That's definitely much simpler and less troublesome than the whole thing 
with recompiling the kernel etc.

The only difference between the released and CVS code is that the 
released code:
A) contains the bug-fixes
B) has been tested.

A has been done by Hynek, but B can't be done without people testing it. 
  And this is how you can help it to become released.  Of course you 
have the choice to wait until others do so.  But if you don't want to 
wait, I don't see the point in going around rather than going straight.

Best regards, Tomas
