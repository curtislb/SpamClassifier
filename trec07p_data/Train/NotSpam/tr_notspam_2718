Making news today...

* A new CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll released this morning finds support for the war in Iraq remains low amid
widespread feelings that the war is going badly and that sending additional troops to Iraq won't make any difference.


Most Americans (72%) say they are closely following the ongoing dispute between President Bush and the Democrats in
Congress over proposed timetables for withdrawal -- and a likely Bush veto of the Iraq appropriations bill if it
includes such a proposal. Six in ten think that they would wind up siding with the Democrats in this dispute; 37% say
they are more likely to take the President's side.

Overall, 32% support the war, while 66% oppose it.

(Today's top political stories from news organizations across the country)

VICTIMS LEAVE BEHIND "A GRIEVING NATION," SAYS BUSH: Representing America's anguish, President Bush told Virginia Tech
students and teachers at a somber convocation Tuesday that the nation was praying for them and "there's a power in
these prayers." "It's impossible to make sense of such violence and suffering," Bush said at a memorial service on the
campus where 33 people, including the suspected gunman, died in shootings the day before. "Those whose lives were taken
did nothing to deserve their fate," the president said. "They were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. Now
they're gone - and they leave behind grieving families, and grieving classmates, and a grieving nation." Before flying
to the tragedy-stricken university in southwestern Virginia, Bush ordered flags flown at half staff and issued a
written proclamation in honor of those killed and wounded. AP via Yahoo! News: Bush offers condolences at Virginia Tech
http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070418/ap_on_go_pr_wh/bush_virginia_tech

VA GOV CALLS FOR REVIEW OF TECH INCIDENT RESPONSE: Virginia Gov. Timothy M. Kaine (D) ordered an independent review
yesterday of Virginia Tech's handling of Monday's massacre after 24 hours of criticism that the university waited too
long to inform students and faculty of a potential danger. Kaine's announcement came in response to a request from the
school's president and board of visitors that the governor take the lead in finding a group of credible, experienced
outside examiners. He said the investigation will cover actions taken Monday and questions about whether university
officials were warned earlier that the shooter, Cho Seung Hui, was troubled. Washington Post: Kaine Orders Independent
Investigation http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/17/AR2007041700912.html

"WASHINGTON LARGELY PROCEEDED AS USUAL": Following the worst shooting in American history, Congress flinched -- but
only a bit. There were moments of silence and short floor speeches expressing sympathy for the Virginia Tech victims.
Flags dipped to half-staff, and some members canceled press conferences. When asked, congressional aides described the
mood on Capitol Hill as "somber." But just a quarter-inch below the surface Tuesday, the familiar rhythm of attack and
counterattack, speechmaking and lawmaking, political posturing and partisan bickering continued as if a college campus
fewer than 300 miles away hadn't been capsized by a lone gunman. Despite predictions by some aides that lawmakers would
show restraint, Washington largely proceeded as usual. The Politico: Congress Barely Flinches
http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0407/3573.html

PELOSI DELAYS NAMING MEMBERS TO FINISH WAR SPENDING BILL: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi yesterday delayed appointing
lawmakers to finish a war-funding bill, putting off the emergency legislation for the second day since returning from
the House's two-week spring break. Mrs. Pelosi, California Democrat, did not name conferees Monday because severe
storms slowed some East Coast lawmakers' returns to Washington and because some lawmakers attended Virginia Tech
services for the shooting victims, her office said. "We need the conferees in order to make progress on the bill," said
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who will join Mrs. Pelosi and other congressional leaders at a White House
meeting with President Bush today. Washington Times: Pelosi stalls on war bill conferees
http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20070417-104248-1728r.htm

PELOSI DECLINES, THEN ACCEPTS OFFER OF PETRAEUS BRIEFING: The top military commander in Iraq will make a rare visit to
Capitol Hill next week but House Democratic leaders — unlike their Senate counterparts — initially declined the Defense
Department's offer of a Members-only closed-door briefing with Army Gen. David Petraeus, according to Congressional and
administration sources. A spokesman for Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) at first acknowledged Tuesday that the
Pentagon's request to have Petraeus give a House briefing had been denied due to "scheduling conflicts" next week.
Later on Tuesday, Pelosi's office contacted Roll Call stating that the Speaker was now working to set up a session. "We
intend to schedule a meeting for Members of the House to hear from Gen. Petraeus on April 26th," said Pelosi spokesman
Nadeam Elshami. Roll Call: Petraeus Visit Sparks Debate http://www.rollcall.com/issues/52_110/news/18034-1.html

HOUSE PANEL CONSIDERS IMMUNITY FOR GOODLING: The confrontation between Congress and the Bush administration over the
dismissal of eight U.S. attorneys escalated again yesterday as Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee said they are
weighing an offer of immunity to a potential key witness in the investigation. At the same time, the Republican
National Committee yesterday turned down congressional demands that it hand over e-mails related to the firings,
angering Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.). Frustrated by Monica M. Goodling's refusal to
testify, committee Democrats said they may grant limited-use immunity to the former counsel to Attorney General Alberto
R. Gonzales. Washington Post: Immunity for Ex-Gonzales Aide Weighed
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/17/AR2007041701984.html

ACCIDENTAL GUN SHOT WOUNDS TWO SECRET SERVICE OFFICERS: Two uniformed Secret Service officers were treated at a
hospital yesterday with gunshot wounds after one of their pistols accidentally fired, a spokesman said. The incident
occurred shortly after 2 p.m. in a guard shack at the southwest entrance to the White House complex while President
Bush and First Lady Laura Bush were at a memorial service in Blacksburg, Va., for victims of the Virginia Tech shooting
spree. "There was an accidental discharge of a service-issued weapon," said Secret Service spokesman Darrin Blackford.
The 9-mm. bullet went through the outside leg of one officer, struck a concrete floor, then shattered into pieces, and
shrapnel hit the other officer in the face, Blackford said. The Secret Service would not release the names of the
officers but said both were taken to nearby George Washington University Hospital. Both were treated for superficial
wounds in the emergency room and were released. New York Daily News: Drama at the White House

WHCA GOES WITH SAFE PICK FOR DINNER ROUTINE: After more than 40 years in show business, Rich Little is still a working
comedian, doing his well-practiced impersonations from Las Vegas to Granite Falls, Minn. He is even available for
corporate retreats and weddings. But this weekend, Mr. Little will return to the national stage, where he once held a
regular place, when he appears at the Hilton Washington as headliner at the White House Correspondents' Association
dinner. It is the capital's premier social event for the president, Congressional leaders and the reporters who cover
them — some of whom were too young to know Mr. Little's work, others who were surprised to learn he was still alive
(actually, he is only 68). New York Times: No Offense Intended With This Year's Choice of Entertainer, but Still an
Outcry http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/18/washington/18memo.html

CORZINE'S CAR DRIVING 91 MPH BEFORE ACCIDENT: In the seconds before Gov. Jon S. Corzine was critically injured in an
accident last Thursday, the Chevrolet Suburban he was riding in was traveling 91 miles per hour, 26 m.p.h. over the
posted speed limit, according to a crash data recorder retrieved from the vehicle. The superintendent of the state
police, Col. Joseph R. Fuentes, said Tuesday that the trooper driving the vehicle, Robert J. Rasinski, had told
investigators that he did not know how fast he was traveling as he led Mr. Corzine's two-car caravan, emergency lights
flashing, from an Atlantic City speech to a meeting at the governor's mansion in Princeton. But the recorder clocked
the speed at 91 m.p.h. five seconds before the Suburban collided with a white pickup truck, and at 30 m.p.h. when it
slammed into a guardrail along the shoulder of the Garden State Parkway, the police said. New York Times: Corzine's
Speed Put at 91 M.P.H. Near Crash Site http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/18/nyregion/18corzine.html

CANDIDATES CAREFUL IN GUN COMMENTS: Democratic White House hopefuls yesterday struggled with whether they should
embrace increased gun control measures following Monday's horrific massacre at Virginia Tech. Campaigns offered nuanced
responses to questions on the issue, indicating an effort to assuage their base without offending Red State America.
"In much of America, gun ownership is part of a way of life," a spokesman for former Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.) said in
a statement. "John Edwards believes that the Second Amendment protects gun ownership and that we must keep guns out of
criminals' hands." The Hill: Dem hopefuls mostly mum on gun

NO SECOND TIER IN GOP '08 FIELD... JUST 1ST AND 3RD: Republicans' presidential field may be wide, but this weekend's
fundraising numbers show it is not deep. Other than Mitt Romney, Rudolph W. Giuliani and John McCain, no Republican
raised $2 million or had $1 million cash on hand as of March 31, making it nearly impossible for them to challenge the
top three candidates. "At this point, there is no second tier in the Republican Party," said one longtime campaign
observer who spoke on the condition he not be named in order to give a straightforward assessment. "It's really more of
a first tier and a third tier." Sen. Sam Brownback, Kansas Republican, led the pack of challengers with $1.9 million
raised, but he reported already spending $1.1 million of that. Coming in next was Rep. Tom Tancredo, Colorado
Republican, with $1.3 million raised, who beat the three former governors who had been expected to fill out the second
tier: James S. Gilmore III of Virginia, Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin and Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, all of whom raised
less than $600,000. Washington Times: Second-tier GOP hopefuls lack cash

SHARPTON DRAWS TOP DEM CONTENDERS TO NAN CONVENTION: Civil rights activist Al Sharpton, whose profile soared in his
recent push for dismissal of radio personality Don Imus, is attracting all the major Democratic presidential candidates
for his annual convention this week. John Edwards was scheduled to address the National Action Network convention on
Wednesday, the first of the White House hopefuls. The other candidates, as well as Democratic National Committee
chairman	Howard Dean, will address the group the remainder of the week. Top candidates Hillary Rodham Clinton
and Barack Obama are scheduled to appear Friday and Saturday. The Network is a New York-based political, social and
activist organization and Sharpton is its president. AP via Yahoo! News: Sharpton attracts Dems to his convention
http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070418/ap_on_el_pr/on_the2008_trail

ROMNEY FINDS A GOLD MINE IN LARGELY UNTAPPED UTAH: An array of donors who never had given money in a federal election
opened their wallets to Mitt Romney this year, drawn to him through his networks in the business world and the Mormon
church. Utah, seldom a go-to state for politicians seeking money, was Romney's second most generous state, reflecting
the ties he has built there through the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and his time as president of the
Salt Lake Olympics Organizing Committee. That success helped vault Romney to the top of the money race among Republican
presidential candidates with more than $20 million in the first quarter of this year. An analysis of new campaign
finance reports by The Associated Press shows that in some Utah ZIP codes, Romney, a Mormon and former governor of
Massachusetts, raised nearly 10 times the amounts raised by President Bush in each of the past two presidential
elections. AP via Yahoo! News: Mitt Romney helps tap new donors
http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070418/ap_on_el_pr/romney_money

CLINTON STILL PAYING ATTENTION TO THE SMALL STUFF IN NY: On the same day that Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) announced that
he had raised $25 million in the first three months of his presidential campaign, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.)
made her own $25 million announcement -- a federal grant to restore oyster beds in Long Island Sound. In the 6 1/2
years since she was elected to the Senate, Clinton has paid close attention to the constituent services and pork-barrel
politics that earned one of her predecessors, Republican Alfonse M. D'Amato, the nickname "Senator Pothole." Even now,
when many fellow candidates have no time for making all their Senate votes, much less announcing federal grants,
Clinton seems intent on proving her commitment to her adopted state. Washington Post: For Clinton, Even Presidential
Politics Is Local http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/17/AR2007041701987.html

BILL TO DELIVER SIX COMMENCEMENT SPEECHES, INCLUDING UNH: Former President Bill Clinton, one of the most coveted and
elusive commencement speakers at U.S. colleges, spurns dozens of invitations each year. This spring, he's stepping up
his schedule as his wife, U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton of New York, runs for the office he once held. He will triple
his recent annual average and talk to graduates on six campuses, led by Harvard University and the University of New
Hampshire, the biggest school in the state that hosts the nation's first presidential primary. "Whenever he's in the
news, she's in the news," said Dean Spiliotes, 43, research director at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at
Saint Anselm College in Manchester. "It's a good thing for her." Bloomberg: Clinton Triples College Speaking Schedule
as Hillary Campaigns http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=washingtonstory&sid=abPaaJi51iHA

FRED THOMPSON COMES TO DC: When actor and former Sen. Fred Thompson first said in a television interview March 11 that
he was "giving some thought" to running for president, it sounded almost casual. Since then, however, Thompson and his
supporters have conducted a methodical pre-campaign campaign, which continues today with a trip to Capitol Hill to meet
with Republican House members who are interested in his potential candidacy. Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Tenn., one of those
pushing a Thompson run, arranged for the meeting at the National Republican Club of Capitol Hill. He said 60
Republicans expressed interest in meeting Thompson, and he expects at least 40 will attend. The Tennessean: Thompson's
pre-decision tour continues http://tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070418/NEWS08/704180427/1025

TOUGH WEEK FOR LA MAYOR: Stung by the city's failed Olympics bid and the latest setback to his schools takeover plan,
Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa faces two other uphill battles this week as he unveils a gang-prevention strategy and a lean
city budget, both of which are meeting resistance. Villaraigosa will deliver his annual State of the City address
tonight, outlining an anti-gang plan that calls for a different approach from that advocated by some civil rights
advocates. On Thursday, Villaraigosa will unveil his 2-year-old administration's second budget, a financial blueprint
that will call for slashing $100 million from the city's $231-million structural deficit, amid declining revenue and
upcoming contract negotiations. Los Angeles Times: It's a good week not to be mayor of L.A.

MEMBER PERFORMS HEIMLICH AT HILL RESTAURANT: At Charlie Palmer Steak on Monday night, Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.)
performed the Heimlich maneuver on a woman who was choking on her steak. the Congressman was enjoying a quiet dinner at
the swank Capitol Hill steakhouse when he noticed a commotion at a nearby table. A woman had jumped up from her table,
clearly in distress, the Congressman told HOH, while her dining companion was slumped in the booth. The Congressman
promptly swung into action. "I asked her if she was choking and she indicated she was," Thompson told HOH. He estimates
it took about three or four Heimlich maneuvers to dislodge the misguided food. After catching her breath, Thompson
reports, the woman was fine. It turned out that the choking victim was a visitor from New Jersey who was eating dinner
with her daughter, a local law student. Roll Call: Cough It Up http://www.rollcall.com/issues/52_110/hoh/18029-1.html
