Subject: Parrot::Configure::_runstep():  What is the purpose of this 'verbose'
 setting?

In lib/Parrot/Configure.pm there is the following code (trunk:   
starting at line 254):

     # XXX cc_build uses this verbose setting, why?
     $self->data->set( verbose => $verbose ) if $n > 2;

$n is the index in the array of configuration steps of the step  
currently being processed.  $verbose is a value passed to _runsteps()  
from the surrounding method runsteps(), which in turn is the value  
for the 'verbose' option passed to Configure.pl:

   sub runsteps {	# trunk:  line 184
     my $self = shift;

     my ( $verbose, $verbose_step, $ask ) = $self->options->get(qw 
(verbose verbose-step ask));

     my $n = 0;    # step number
     foreach my $task ( $self->steps ) {
         $n++;
         $self->_runstep( $task, $verbose, $verbose_step, $ask, $n );

So that means that if we're on the 4th configuration step  
(init::miniparrot) or later, make the current step's verbose setting  
have the value passed into the 'verbose' option to Configure.pl.

My questions:

1.  Is my interpretation correct?
2.  If so, why should this only apply beginning with the 4th  
configuration step?  Why not right from the 1st step?
3.  And what does the XXX comment mean?   cc_build(), which is a  
method from lib/Parrot/Configure/Step.pm, is not the only step  
utility method that has a verbose setting.  Why should it be singled  
out here?

Thank you very much.
