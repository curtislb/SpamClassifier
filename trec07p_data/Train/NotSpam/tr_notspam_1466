P.S.: Please do not reply to me, Cc:ing the list, as I didn't asked you
to do so.  I am a debian-legal subscriber and would rather avoid
receiving the same message twice.  Reply to the list only (as long as
you want to send a public response).  See
http://www.debian.org/MailingLists/#codeofconduct
for more details.  Thanks.
