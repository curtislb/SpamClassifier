     I'm not concerned about Mickeysoft.  S'why it took almost five
years to finally break down and put the $#%$%&^ garbage back on my
computer.  I've regretted every single day it has ran. <grins>  Never
could get W95 to consistantly connect at 56K...even with programming the
NVRAM on my external modem and re-writing the .inf file.  That was the
main reason I ported to Linux.  I could no longer control my own
computer.  (Lovingly pets "his Precious.)  Linux gave me my computer
back.  Makes my skin crawl to consider how Microsoft is trying to horn
in on Linux.  I !know! they're working with the govt. to eliminate the 
4th Amendment against warrantless searches.  I don't trust Redhat, 
either.  Getting rid of Debian too, because it's too easy to infiltrate 
a trojan via dpkg.  Yeah, I'm paranoid, but when you examine the 
evidence...  Bugrit!

	   Good deal.  I was thinking of using something to wipe my WinXP drive 
and fdisk the thing into about 16 different fat-16 partitions and 
installing freedos and Win 3.11.  Use it as an emergency dual-boot setup 
in case my Seagate croaks.  I'm running removable hard drives.  I don't 
trust Windows not to infect my Linux drive. <laughs>  Give it cooties, 
or something.  Six different OS releases, multiple IE upgrades, and 
thousands of security updates and they still haven't closed the 
email/address book vulnerability.  They want that sucker left wide open.

     Couldn't be any worse than Narrator and Win-Eyes both running at
the same time. <grins>  Wouldn't be any less understandable, anyway. 
I'm thinking of getting another couple screen readers working all at the 
same time.  It'll be just like being right in the middle of a Jerry 
Springer show. <grins>
     Thank you for the URL's.  I have many of them.  They're just in a 
big pile in Firefox's bookmarks.  Can't organize them using Win-Eyes 
yet. <smirks>

         Michael
