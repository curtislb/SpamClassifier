Yeah. We need to use gtk (and the custom gtk widgets which are provided
by Sugar) to have consistent look and feel and interaction.

I have no idea... The information on the wiki is not always accurate.
But well you *can* use xulrunner, just the level of integration with
Sugar you can achieve using it is not satisfactory.

No, see:

It embeds mozilla in an SWT widget using JavaXPCOM.

Now if we had something like that for Pyxpcom/gtk it would be awesome.
There are two things which block me about going with this approach.

1 Is pyxpcom mature enough to do it? (what's your experience with it, is
it reasonably stable and complete?)
2 Time. Writing an embedding widget from scratch, make it stable etc
does not seem like a trivial task.

nsIWebBrowser is just the entry point, it gives you access to the DOM
window/document for the gtkmozembed widget. We need it as pyxpcom object
so that we can access the DOM using pyxpcom (we don't want to write
regular python bindings for the whole DOM api).
