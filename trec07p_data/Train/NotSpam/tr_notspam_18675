Agreed.
In the awk+R scenario, it is clear that the merges are often better done
with R.
My strategy is to use awk only to clean/reformat data into a tabular format
and
do most of the "consolidation" (computations/filtering/merges) in R.  I
suggested to use awk only to perform manipulations that would be more
complex to do within R (especially mutliline records or recors with
optionnal fields). I try to keep the scripts as simple as possible on both
sides

In the first lines of awk scripts, I usually assign column numbers to
variables (e.g. "Code=1, time=3") and then access the fields with "$Code",
"$Time"...
Yet, it is true that it is cumbersome, in awk, to use the labels on the
first line of a file as a variable names (my major complain about awk).

I looked at a few examples of  SAS Data step scripts on the Net, and found
that the awk scripts would be very similar (except for merges), but there
may  manipulations which I missed.

The examples of messy data formats that were described ealier on the list
are good examples where regular expressions will help a lot. In the very
first stage of data inspection, to detect coding "mistakes", awk (sometimes
with the help ot other gnutools such as 'uniq' and 'sort') can be very
efficient.

Nice analogy. Using the right tool for the right task is very important.
So awk and vilno seem complementary.
Yet, when R enters into the equation, do you still "need" the three tools?

What we should really compare is the four situations:

R alone
R + awk
R + vilno
R + awk + vilno

and maybe "R + SAS Data step"

and see what scripts are more  elegant (read 'short and understandable')


Best,

Christophe
