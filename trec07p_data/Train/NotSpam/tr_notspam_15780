I understand that argument, but I do think it requires a leap of logic
(or at least some creative interpretation) to get from the DFSG to this
position. While I can see why some people do not want CDDL-licensed
software in main for the above reason, I do not think it is fair to call
it the Debian position that this is the case; at least not yet.

Counter-arguments:
* The bit "(except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides
  otherwise)" means you don't necessarily have to give up all your
  rights. There are parts of copyright law in most jurisdictions that
  give unalienable rights to users; those fall under the above
  provision, by definition. The net result of your first clause
  therefore may be, depending on circumstances, that users actually get
  _more_ rights than what they started out with if that provision wasn't
  there, because their own copyright law doesn't give them nearly as
  much rights as the copyright law in the country where the software was
  written would.
* Your second quote is a non-issue. The same is true for GPL-licensed
  software; if not, then why did we have to consult two lawyers back
  when we moved crypto to main? And why do we still have such insane
  procedures today when some crypto-using software gets through NEW?
  (you don't see them because ftp-masters handle them, but they're still
  there).

Additionally, personally I don't think it's unreasonable for people to
say "if you use my software in a way that I didn't want you to, I'll sue
you in a court that works by a set of rules that I'm actually
comfortable with". You know, it makes fighting those who do not follow
your license the way you intended them to quite a bit easier.
