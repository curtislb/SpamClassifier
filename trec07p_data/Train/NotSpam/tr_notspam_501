TONIGHT ON SHOWBIZ TONIGHT- CNN HEADLINE PRIME 11pm ET/11pm PT

ANNA NICOLE SMITH: IT'S DNA DAY -- WHO IS DANNIELYNN'S DADDY?
Showbiz Tonight is right there in the Bahamas, for the announcement everyone has been waiting for. Finally, yes finally, the court is expected to rule in the Anna Nicole Smith paternity case. The DNA results are back, so just who is Dannielynn's daddy?

ANNA NICOLE SMITH: DONNA HOGAN, HER YOUNGER SISTER
As the father of Anna Nicole's baby is announced (hopefully), her half-sister Donna joins us on Showbiz Tonight. She'll spill the secrets of what it was like growing up with Anna. Plus, the explosive revelations from her tell-all book, "Train Wreck: The Life and Death of Anna Nicole Smith"

DON IMUS RACIAL SHOCKER: RUTGERS BASKETBALL TEAM SPEAKS
Don Imus has said he’s sorry. He’s apologized, he’s gone on national radio and television to beg forgiveness, he’ll been taken off the air. But today, the women insulted in his racist remarks come forward! Is Imus’s contrition enough, or is there a double standard at play?

PARIS AND NICOLE - UNPLUGGED!
Showbiz Tonight's Brooke Anderson goes one-on-one, er, two with "The Simple Life" stars, Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie. And they are just fed up with the paparazzi. Plus, we'll tell you about their time as counselors at a wellness camp -- including Nicole's enema experience. Yuck!
