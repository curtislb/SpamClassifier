under your programs create a t directory (t for testing) and add a
series of scripts to test your application as xyz.t.

My safemove module has the following test script.  I also have a check
to ensure that pod is coded in the modules.

#!/usr/bin/perl -w
# vi:set sw=4 ts=4 et cin:
# $Id: SafeMove.t,v 1.2 2006/04/24 02:43:07 foskey Exp $

=head1 NAME

SafeMove.t

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Ensure that the SafeMove module is functioning correctly.

SafeMove( $filename2, $filename );

SafeMove( $filename, $filename2 );

$basename = $filename2.'/'.basename($filename);
ok( -f $basename, "Moving from file to directory" );
