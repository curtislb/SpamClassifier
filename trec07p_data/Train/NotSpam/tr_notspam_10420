That is not where the R FAQ says to get the R sources.  See

http://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#How-can-R-be-obtained_003f

It may be the same as the documented file, but I'll leave you to verify 
that.

On the other hand, I would always recommend starting with the 
current R-patched tarball, and there are three changes there that may help 
with such an old OS as yours (see below).

This looks like part of the output of ./configure.  In the top level 
directory there should be a file called INSTALL.  This asks you to read 
the 'R Installation and Administration Manual'.  The online version is at 
http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-admin.html: please search for 
'readline'.

I don't see 'a lot', and I have seen this one quite a few times.  Try 
searching the list archives for '--with-readline=yes' if you want to 
confirm this.

More generally, Solaris 8 (aka SunOS 5.8) is a rather old OS (our box says 
'October 2001') and did not even come with compilers.  Please read the 
section on Solaris in the 'Platform Notes' in the manual I cited to make 
sure you have the necessary tools and that they are recent enough.
(You may need to seek help from your sysadmins on this.)  As well as 
libreadline, you will need libiconv (unless you use R-patched and 
--without-iconv).
