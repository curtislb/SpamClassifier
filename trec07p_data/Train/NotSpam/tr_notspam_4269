Britain urges more action to cut drug prices for poor

london • Western drugmakers should do more to cut prices and must
recognise that developing countries have a right to break patents to
guarantee access to vital medicines, a top British official said yesterday.

International development minister Gareth Thomas said poor countries
must be allowed to make the most of existing patent rules to provide
low-cost drugs and it was not acceptable for big companies to just
protect their own commercial interests.

“We support, absolutely, the right of developing countries to use the
flexibilities of the system when there is a big public health issue,”
Thomas told Reuters during an international conference on access to
medicines.

Controversy over the matter has flared up since Thailand two months ago
issued compulsory licences to override patents and allow the production
or purchase of generic versions of drugs, stunning leading
pharmaceutical firms. Thomas declined to comment specifically on the
Thai case but said there was a clear need to do more to cut the price of
certain life-saving therapies.

Figures released by the World Health Organisation this week showed more
than 2 million people living with HIV/Aids in low- and middle-income
countries were receiving treatment at the end end of 2006 — but this was
still well below what was needed.

Experts have also warned that a growing number of patients require
second-line therapies because they have developed resistance to their
initial medication. Yet the price of these products is typically many
times higher than the original drugs, pushing them out of reach.

US drugmaker Abbott Laboratories Inc earlier this month offered to slash
the cost of one such second-line Aids drug, Kaletra, by more than half
to $1,000 per patient a year in 40 poor countries. The move followed
intense criticism by Aids activists and a spat with Thailand over its
compulsory licence plans.

Thomas said there should be more such price reductions. “I hope we are
going to see more action in terms of lowering prices on second-line ARVs
(antiretrovirals) ... Many are still simply unaffordable for countries
with over-stretched health budgets,” he said.
