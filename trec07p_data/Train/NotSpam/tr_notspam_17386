The "Kern's licence" thingy isn't a problem.

If I, for example, release a load of code under the GPL, and then later 
say "I'm releasing all my code - *including stuff already out there* - 
under the GPL", the fact that there may be loads of stuff of mine out 
there saying "GPL" is irrelevant.

Anybody can now either add a copy of my statement about the LGPL to the 
licencing file, or add a pointer to my statement, and then they can take 
any of my code that claims to be GPL'd and use it under the LGPL.

So if Kern has said that the addition of this extra freedom "applies to 
all his code in Bacula", then anybody can add a copy of this statement 
to COPYING.TXT and be covered.

Cheers,
Wol
