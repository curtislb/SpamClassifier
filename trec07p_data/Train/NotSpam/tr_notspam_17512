Subject: Call for papers--Conference on risk management

Risk Assessment - Management Strategies
Aschaffenburg/Germany, Stadthalle am Schloss February 14-16, 2008

International Conference of the Restorers Association of Germany (VDR -
Verband der Restauratoren e.V.)

Working Group Preventive Conservation

Natural disasters as flood disasters or burnings clarify the difficulties to
prevent cultural heritage from such risks and to act in case of an emergency
in a time-efficient way. Besides these disastrous catastrophes it is
necessary for every museum institution in terms of different risks and
threats to minimize cases of damage or loss by cautious risk assessment and
to act on cost-efficient and time-effective management strategies.
Protections should therefore include e.g. fire control, natural disasters,
anti-theft devices and vandalism as well as war and terrorism. Management
strategies have to apply both for smaller emergencies and for big disasters.

This international conference is to set the state-of-the-art in the field of
risk assessment and management strategies. Participants are invited to an
all-embracing exchange of experience and to discuss patterns of behaviour in
emergencies, cost-efficient and time-efficient safety concepts as well as
responsibilities and information management. Due to the complexity of this
topic, papers from different fields are requested.

The official languages of the conference are German and English (no
simultaneous translation). Accepted papers are included in the conference
materials, publication in a reviewed journal is foreseen.

Conference Deadlines:

The organizers invite you to contribute posters and papers in German and/or
English on your latest work to the mentioned subject areas.
Please use the abstract template which is available online at

    http://www.restauratoren.de/index.php?id=240 

and send your abstract by e-mail to the organization committee at
FG-PraeventiveKonservierung [at] gmx__net

Abstracts deadline is September 1,  2007.

The program will be available after review of all contributions.

Information: Details and further information (conference deadlines, fees,
accommodation etc.) are available under URL above.

An exciting exhibition in Berlin awakes a plea for the return of stolen

FOR many, the word Angkor evokes a single temple packed with tourists eager
to see what's left of a corner of Asia's ancient past. ?Angkor: Sacred
Heritage of Cambodia?, an exhibition in Berlin, corrects this impression.
Spanning more than 1,000 years of Hindu- and Buddhist-inspired art?stone
sculptures, a handful of stunning bronzes and a coda of wooden statues?the
show makes clear that Angkor was a sophisticated complex led by a succession
of kings who held sway over the Khmer people and hundreds of square miles of
land studded with beautiful art created for the glory of the gods. 

Gollings, St Kilda, Australien

Hevajra, a Buddhist deity, graces BerlinThere are two stories that unfold in
the cool lofty rooms of Berlin's 19th-century Martin-Gropius-Bau museum?a
far cry from the sweaty heat of the National Museum of Phnom Penh, which has
lent many of the exhibits. First, are the splendid sculptures dominated by a
procession of the Hindu deities, Vishnu and Shiva, plus Harihara, who
represents a mixture of both. One of the most striking is the serene face
and upper body of Vishnu in a sleeping pose, an 11th-century fragment of
what is believed to have been the largest bronze statue ever cast in
Cambodia.


The second story is less obvious and probably unintended by the show's
organisers. It is to do with the wholesale looting of the temples that began
when the French swept into Angkor 150 years ago. In the style of European
colonisers of the period, acquisitive French explorers strapped prize
statues onto the backs of locals for the trip out of the jungle, then loaded
them onto rafts for the journey down the Mekong river for dispatch to Paris.
Many ended up as the core of the collection of Asian art at Paris's Mus?e
Guimet. 

More shocking has been the rape of Khmer art since Cambodia's independence.
Little free-standing statuary is left at the temples. Cambodian and Thai
soldiers, acting for well-organised rings, have hacked at much of it leaving
pedestals empty, walls with holes and, in some cases, headless and armless
torsos. 

Unfortunately, as a star statue in Berlin shows, possessions of the National
Museum in Phnom Penh were not always safe, either. A well-girthed Shiva,
clasping a lotus in one outstretched hand, and his diminutive wife, Uma, in
the other is placed prominently in one of the Berlin rooms. But Uma's head
is missing. The Berlin curators don't say so on their description, but her
head was stolen?literally hacked off?when the piece was on show at the Phnom
Penh museum in the 1970s. 

Security, upkeep and finance have all greatly improved at the museum since
then. Indeed, the sculptures look a little lost away from their usual
habitat in the more informal setting of Phnom Penh. There, the galleries
open on to a courtyard filled with coconut palms and vermillion flowers,
allowing a visitor to daydream about the landscape where the original
artists of Angkor worked.

In their temporary home in Berlin, the sculptures are given descriptions
that are a little thin. A visitor would do well to invest in ?Art and
Architecture of Cambodia?, a history by Helen Ibbitson Jessup, the curator
of the blockbuster Khmer exhibition that took place at Washington's National
Gallery of Art in 1997, which is available at the museum bookstore. 

With the Phnom Penh collection now recognised as a great repository of Khmer
art, might some collectors consider repatriating at least part of their
booty to its rightful place? Many possessors of stolen Khmer art argue that
it is safer in their hands than it would be in Cambodia, but this may no
longer be the case. Where, for a start, is Uma's head? 



?Angkor: Sacred Heritage of Cambodia? is at Martin-Gropius-Bau, Berlin,
until July 29th. It is then at Museum Rietberg, Zurich, from August 19th
until December 2nd.

In Iraq's four-year looting frenzy, the allies have become the vandals


British and American collusion in the pillaging of Iraq's heritage is a
scandal that will outlive any passing conflict 

Simon Jenkins
Friday June 8, 2007
The Guardian 


Fly into the American air base of Tallil outside Nasiriya in central Iraq
and the flight path is over the great ziggurat of Ur, reputedly the earliest
city on earth. Seen from the base in the desert haze or the sand-filled
gloom of dusk, the structure is indistinguishable from the mounds of fuel
dumps, stores and hangars. Ur is safe within the base compound. But its
walls are pockmarked with wartime shrapnel and a blockhouse is being built
over an adjacent archaeological site. When the head of Iraq's supposedly
sovereign board of antiquities and heritage, Abbas al-Hussaini, tried to
inspect the site recently, the Americans refused him access to his own most
important monument.

Yesterday Hussaini reported to the British Museum on his struggles to
protect his work in a state of anarchy. It was a heart breaking
presentation. Under Saddam you were likely to be tortured and shot if you
let someone steal an antiquity; in today's Iraq you are likely to be
tortured and shot if you don't. The tragic fate of the national museum in
Baghdad in April 2003 was as if federal troops had invaded New York city,
sacked the police and told the criminal community that the Metropolitan was
at their disposal. The local tank commander was told specifically not to
protect the museum for a full two weeks after the invasion. Even the Nazis
protected the Louvre.
When I visited the museum six months later, its then director, Donny George,
proudly showed me the best he was making of a bad job. He was about to
reopen, albeit with half his most important objects stolen. The pro-war
lobby had stopped pretending that the looting was nothing to do with the
Americans, who were shamefacedly helping retrieve stolen objects under the
dynamic US colonel, Michael Bogdanos (author of a book on the subject). The
vigorous Italian cultural envoy to the coalition, Mario Bondioli-Osio, was
giving generously for restoration.

The beautiful Warka vase, carved in 3000BC, was recovered though smashed
into 14 pieces. The exquisite Lyre of Ur, the world's most ancient musical
instrument, was found badly damaged. Clerics in Sadr City were ingeniously
asked to tell wives to refuse to sleep with their husbands if looted objects
were not returned, with some success. Nothing could be done about the
fire-gutted national library and the loss of five centuries of Ottoman
records (and works by Piccasso and Miro). But the message of winning hearts
and minds seemed to have got through.

Today the picture is transformed. Donny George fled for his life last August
after death threats. The national museum is not open but shut. Nor is it
just shut. Its doors are bricked up, it is surrounded by concrete walls and
its exhibits are sandbagged. Even the staff cannot get inside. There is no
prospect of reopening.

Hussaini confirmed a report two years ago by John Curtis, of the British
Museum, on America's conversion of Nebuchadnezzar's great city of Babylon
into the hanging gardens of Halliburton. This meant a 150-hectare camp for
2,000 troops. In the process the 2,500-year-old brick pavement to the Ishtar
Gate was smashed by tanks and the gate itself damaged. The archaeology-rich
subsoil was bulldozed to fill sandbags, and large areas covered in compacted
gravel for helipads and car parks. Babylon is being rendered
archaeologically barren.

Meanwhile the courtyard of the 10th-century caravanserai of Khan al-Raba was
used by the Americans for exploding captured insurgent weapons. One blast
demolished the ancient roofs and felled many of the walls. The place is now
a ruin.

Outside the capital some 10,000 sites of incomparable importance to the
history of western civilisation, barely 20% yet excavated, are being looted
as systematically as was the museum in 2003. When George tried to remove
vulnerable carvings from the ancient city of Umma to Baghdad, he found gangs
of looters already in place with bulldozers, dump trucks and AK47s.

Hussaini showed one site after another lost to archaeology in a four-year
"looting frenzy". The remains of the 2000BC cities of Isin and Shurnpak
appear to have vanished: pictures show them replaced by a desert of badger
holes created by an army of some 300 looters. Castles, ziggurats, deserted
cities, ancient minarets and mosques have gone or are going. Hussaini has 11
teams combing the country engaged in rescue work, mostly collecting detritus
left by looters. His small force of site guards is no match for heavily
armed looters, able to shift objects to eager European and American dealers
in days.

Most ominous is a message reputedly put out from Moqtada al-Sadr's office,
that while Muslim heritage should be respected, pre-Muslim relics were up
for grabs. As George said before his flight, his successors might be "only
interested in Islamic sites and not Iraq's earlier heritage". While Hussaini
is clearly devoted to all Iraq's history, the Taliban's destruction of
Afghanistan's pre-Muslim Bamiyan Buddhas is in every mind.

Despite Sadr's apparent preference, sectarian militias are pursuing an orgy
of destruction of Muslim sites. Apart from the high-profile bombings of some
of the loveliest surviving mosques in the Arab world, radical groups opposed
to all shrines have begun blasting 10th- and 11th-century structures,
irrespective of Sunni or Shia origin. Eighteen ancient shrines have been
lost, 10 in Kirkuk and the south in the past month alone. The great monument
and souk at Kifel, north of Najaf - reputedly the tomb of Ezekiel and once
guarded by Iraqi Jews (mostly driven into exile by the occupation) - have
been all but destroyed.

It is abundantly clear that the Americans and British are not protecting
Iraq's historic sites. All foreign archaeologists have had to leave. Troops
are doing nothing to prevent the "farming" of known antiquities. This is in
direct contravention of the Geneva Convention that an occupying army should
"use all means within its power" to guard the cultural heritage of a
defeated state.

Shortly after the invasion, the British minister Tessa Jowell won plaudits
for "pledging" ?5m to protect Iraq's antiquities. I can find no one who can
tell me where, how or whether this money has been spent. It appears to have
been pure spin. Only the British Museum and the British School of
Archaeology in Iraq have kept the flag flying. The latter's grant has just
been cut, presumably to pay for the Olympics binge.

As long as Britain and America remain in denial over the anarchy they have
created in Iraq, they clearly feel they must deny its devastating
side-effects. Two million refugees now camping in Jordan and Syria are
ignored, since life in Iraq is supposed to be "better than before". Likewise
dozens of Iraqis working for the British and thus facing death threats are
denied asylum. To grant it would mean the former defence and now home
secretary, the bullish John Reid, admitting he was wrong. They will die
before he does that.

Though I opposed the invasion I assumed that its outcome would at least be a
more civilised environment. Yet Iraq's people are being murdered in droves
for want of order. Authority has collapsed. That western civilisation should
have been born in so benighted a country as Iraq may seem bad luck. But only
now is that birth being refused all guardianship, in defiance of
international law. If this is Tony Blair's "values war", then language has
lost all meaning. British collusion in such destruction is a scandal that
will outlive any passing conflict. And we had the cheek to call the Taliban
vandals.

Opere d'arte rubate, piacentino nei guai
Manager di 58 anni accusato di incauto acquisto di due quadric

C'? anche un insospettabile manager piacentino fra gli acquirenti delle
ottantotto opere d'arte rubate e recuperate dai carabinieri del Nucleo
operativo di Pordenone nei giorni scorsi in varie citt? del Nord Italia.
La notizia ? stata resa nota ieri. I militari dell'Arma hanno sgominato una
banda dedita al traffico di opere d'arte e sono scattate nove denunce per
ricettazione: si tratta per lo pi? di persone che abitano in Veneto. 
A Piacenza ? stato invece denunciato un manager di 58 anni, accusato di
incauto acquisto. L'uomo si ? difeso con i carabinieri dicendo che non
sapeva di aver acquistato quadri rubati. 
Secondo gli accertamenti degli investigatori dell'Arma il manager avrebbe
comprato un paio di dipinti del Seicento.
Per la parte piacentina di questa indagine hanno collaborato con i
carabinieri di Pordenone i carabinieri del Nucleo operativo del reparto
operativo della nostra citt?, diretti dal tenente Rocco Papaleo e coordinati
dal colonnello Edoardo Cappellano.
Nel corso di questa indagine avviata nel settembre del 2006 in seguito al
ritrovamento avvenuto a Pordenone di un acquerello della scuola Bolognese
risalente a 1600 ? stato rinvenuto anche il dipinto "Scena Carnevalesca" di
Domenico Tiepolo, risalente al 1765. Era stato trafugato a Roma nel 2001
dallo studio di un noto avvocato. Il dipinto, del valore di circa un milione
di euro, ? una delle due copie originali (di cui una custodita in un museo
di Barcellona). Era stato rivenduto per poche migliaia di euro in un
mercatino del nord est.
Una cinquantina le perquisizioni compiute nel corso dell'operazione: in
Veneto, Lombardia e Emilia Romagna.
Per mettere a segno i colpi, i malfattori utilizzavano un sistema ormai
rodato: agivano in studi professionali di avvocati, notai e commercialisti o
in ville, castelli e dimore private della borghesia romana, approfittando di
lunghi periodi di assenza dei proprietari.
Assieme al Tiepolo, sono state sequestrate altre ottantasette opere d'arte
ma soltanto per 14 di esse ? stato possibile per ora, accertare la
provenienza e risalire ai legittimi proprietari. Le opere sequestrate sono
tutte state ritrovate in case di collezionisti: tra di essi avvocati,
commercialisti, ma anche un fisico e un macellaio con la passione per la
pittura antica. Tra quelle ancora in cerca di un padrone c'? invece una
preziosissima icona greco-ortodossa che - secondo gli esperti - proviene con
molta probabilit? da Costantinopoli e il cui valore ? inestimabile. 
Gli investigatori hanno cos? anche lanciato un appello per cercare di
risalire ai proprietari dell'ottantina di opere ancora da attribuire che
sar? possibile presto vedere sul sito internet dei carabinieri.

Ciudad de M?xico. M?xico devolvi? este jueves a Guatemala el ?leo sobre tela
del siglo XVII Sue?o del papa Gregorio IX, que hab?a sido robado el 2 de
mayo de 2004 del Museo de Arte Colonial de Antigua, Guatemala.

El procurador general de la Rep?blica, Eduardo Medina Mora, hizo la entrega
en la capital mexicana a su par guatemalteco, Juan Luis Florido, que
calific? de hist?rica la recuperaci?n del lienzo, en un acto al que asisti?
tambi?n el embajador de Guatemala, Manuel Soto.

La pintura de Crist?bal de Villalpando, de 2.6 metros de alto por 3.6 de
ancho, muestra a un hombre recostado en una cama con la cabeza apoyada en el
antebrazo y sobre almohadas, y frente a ?l, en una nube, a una figura que
representa a San Francisco de As?s.

El lienzo, con un valor estimado de 280 mil d?lares, hab?a sido dividido en
dos partes para su venta por los ladrones, una con la imagen de San
Francisco y la otra con el resto del cuadro.

La primera parte se recuper? en enero del a?o pasado y la segunda un mes
despu?s, en el poblado de Ajij? del estado de Jalisco, en el centro-oeste de
M?xico.

Seg?n las autoridades, el cuadro fue sustra?do por miembros de una banda de
ladrones de arte sacro.

Objetos robados de la Catedral de Puno no est?n catalogados 

El robo perpetrado a la bas?lica menor de la Catedral de Puno, es el cuarto
en lo que va del a?o. Seg?n informaci?n proporcionada por el mismo director
del Instituto Nacional de Cultura de Puno, Carlos Landa Gamio, los
facinerosos pertenecer?an a una mafia internacional, mientras que los
objetos robados desde la Catedral no est?n catalogados. 

Landa Gamio, visiblemente preocupado por los robos de valiosas joyas del
templo, lament? lo ocurrido, dando a conocer que lamentablemente los objetos
perdidos no est?n catalogados, seg?n dijo, por desinter?s de ex director de
esa instituci?n, Rolando Paredes Eyzaguirre que, durante su gesti?n, habr?an
mantenido serios problemas con el Obispo de Puno, Jorge Carri?n Pavlich, lo
que limit? la realizaci?n del cat?logo de los objetos. 

?Objetos de muchos de los templos de la regi?n no est?n catalogados, para el
caso de la Catedral de Puno, ya hab?amos tenido conversaciones para
emprender ese trabajo en esta semana?, se?al?, el titular del INC Puno,
dando a conocer que el trabajo de catalogaci?n de los objetos de todos los
templos de la regi?n se terminar?an en el presente a?o. 

Templos robados 2007 

Seg?n inform? el director del Instituto Nacional de Cultura de Puno, en el
presente a?o, los facinerosos ya perpetraron cuatro robos, de los cuales dos
fueron frustrados, mientras que desde los templos de San Pedro de Juli y de
la bas?lica menor de la Catedral de Puno, s? lograron llevarse los objetos
de valor incalculable, mientras tanto la Polic?a ya viene realizando las
investigaciones correspondientes.

Shrines devastated as militants target Iraq's ancient heritage


Rachel Williams
Friday June 8, 2007
The Guardian 


Iraq's archaeological heritage is being systematically destroyed by militant
attacks, the head of the country's antiquities board warned yesterday.
A new phenomenon of holy shrines being targeted has emerged over the last
year, Abbas al-Hussainy told a meeting at the British Museum. At least 18,
dating from the ninth or 10th century, have been hit by devastating bomb
blasts since last February's attack, claimed by al-Qaida, on the Shia shrine
in Samarra, and it is feared more have been struck.

In the provinces of Diyala and Kirkuk 10 shrines have been hit in the last
two weeks, Dr Abbas said. Other archaeological sites are suffering from
neglect.

Dr Abbas was in the UK to draw up a plan outlining how the international
community can help the state board of antiquities carry out its work in the
face of violence.

Showing pictures of shrines full of rubble, he called on foreign governments
to fund scholarships and training for his team working on rescue operations
at bombed sites and conserving damaged antiquities, many of whom lack
qualifications.

He said he had recently been prevented by soldiers at an American checkpoint
from visiting the ancient ziggurat at Ur, where he had been due to meet the
keeper of the British Museum's Middle East department, John Curtis, for a
site inspection.

Dr Curtis said: "What is happening to the shrines is quite horrendous. It's
just gratituitous damage."

Dr Abbas said the problem of looting of archaeological sites appeared to
have levelled off, but continued in some areas.

After the fall of Baghdad in 2003 some 15,000 items were looted from the
city's National Museum, and around 8,000 are still missing. The threat of
insurgent attacks and further plundering means the museum remains closed.
