 hmmm, misunderstanding there. The push worked fine in the sample I
posted, but not in the more complex working program I had simplified
as an example.

understandable misperception on your part, as above

yes, sounds good. Please realize that after many long commercial
projects in C/C++, we
did this to an enormous degree

  actually, I do indeed. In C++, the concept of a deep copy, vs
shallow copy vs ref
comes up all the time. I am just learning the syntax here, not
programming itself

  hey, thats alot of sample! you're good at this, no kidding

  yep, never did miss that. thanks though...

  this is helpful to others to talk this out

constant
source of error.

  aha, a force to be reckoned with. Your point above about the docs is
quite true.
I dont have time to rewrite docs right now.. They do need work though

This is sometimes appearing to be contentious, but I mean it to
produce clarity.
I appreciate your responses
