We're certainly aware of the desire of many users to be able to handle
large data sets.  I have just spent a couple of days working with a
student from another department who wanted to work with a very large
data set that was poorly structured.  Most of my time was spent trying
to convince her about the limitations in the structure of her data and
what could realistically be expected to be computed with it.

If your purpose is to perform data manipulation and extraction on
large data sets then I think that it is not unreasonable to be
expected to learn to use SQL. I find it convenient to use R to do data
manipulation because I know the language and the support tools well
but I don't expect to do data cleaning on millions of records with it.
 I am probably too conservative in what I will ask R to handle for me
because I started using S on a Vax-11/750 that had 2 megabytes of
memory and it's hard to break old habits.

I think the trend in working with large data sets in R will be toward
a hybrid approach of using a database for data storage and retrieval
plus R for the model definition and computation.  Miguel Manese's
SQLiteDF package and some of the work in Bioconductor are steps in
this direction.

However, as was mentioned earlier in this thread, there is an
underlying assumption with R that the user is thinking about the
analysis as he/she is doing it. We sometimes see questions about "I
have a data set with (some large number) of records on several hundred
or thousands of variables" and I want to fit a generalized linear
model to it.

I would be hard pressed to think of a situation where I wanted
hundreds of variables in a statistical model unless they are generated
from one or more factors that have many levels.  And, in that case, I
would want to use random effects rather than fixed effects in a model.
 So just saying that the big challenge is to fit some kind of model
with lots of coefficients to a very large number of observations may
be missing the point.  Defining the model better may be the point.

Let me conclude by saying that these are general observations and not
directed to you personally, Robert.  I don't know what you want R to
do graciously to large data sets so my response is more to the general
point that there should always be a balance between thinking about the
structure of the data and the model and brute force computation.  One
can do data analysis by using the computer as a blunt instrument with
which to bludgeon the problem to death but one can't do elegant data
analysis like that.
