I mentioned in my reply that one might look at successive differences to 
remove the mean level, I think this is effectively the same general 
idea. It is actually implemented in anova.mlm(), which allows you to 
specify a transformation matrix, possibly using formula notation to 
compute the relevant model matrix/matrices.

There is, btw, an alternative approach which involves _conditioning_ on 
contrasts that at known to have mean zero (second order differences for 
a linear within-subjects trend, e.g.). This is not implemented 
systematically anywhere though, as far as I know.
