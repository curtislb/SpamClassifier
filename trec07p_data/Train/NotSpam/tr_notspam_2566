This is probably very simple, but I'm not seeing it. I want to do the
following:


my $lfirst = $first;
$lfirst =~ s/[^a-zA-Z]//g;

in one line. I tried :

my $lfirst = ($first =~ s/[^a-zA-Z]//g); 

but it returned either a blank or null.

I want to maintain the state of $first and store the alpha only version in
$lfirst.

TIA.
