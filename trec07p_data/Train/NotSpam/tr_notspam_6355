A friend of mine is a food writer in New York and asked me to do her
website. I had some free time last year, so I threw it together for her. She
wanted some shots of food (obviously) and I suggested we go with Creative
Commons licensed images on Flickr. After some digging around, we found some
great ones licensed under Attribution only.  And of course we were both
happy not to have to use (or pay for) stock images.  Anyway, I figured this
list might find it an interesting example of a real world application of
cc-licensed images.

Best,

Fred
