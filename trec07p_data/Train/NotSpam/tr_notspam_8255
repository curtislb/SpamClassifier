Hi,

When I'm developing web applications I have a dev version of the 
scripts, modules and database and a live version. Nothing new there.

I'm trying to automate the process of moving the dev site to the live 
site (the dev sites are on a Fedora server on my desk and the live sites 
on a Redhat server in a data centre 200 miles away).

I've written scripts to copy the scripts and modules (and other 
associated files) to my local machine and ftp them to the live server 
and these work fine.

However the final stage is to be able to bring the database structures 
into sync. Currently I keep a list of all the fields/tables/changes I've 
made and do this manually. I also check the table strcutres by hand to 
be sure I didn't miss anything.

I'd like to find a way of comparing the two MySQL database strcutures 
and getting a list of the differences, anyone know of any 
modules/methods for doing this?

Thanks in advance,

Nigel
