Reiner's advice didn't work for me. It's true that the disk was full,
but clobbering some of the topic libraries didn't help matters. It
showed the same symptoms on reboot. (No X start, occasional screen
blanking, and "Id 3 spawning too fast".)

 I'm not sure how to "capture" log and get it to the world; apparently
my olpc can't see the network to scp anything. The best I can do is
page through it and get screen captures. Should I do that?

Since I'm an olpc novice and not a Linux expert I am probably not the
person to work this out. I really have very little idea what to expect
when it does work. And it appears that others are having problems with
385 on OS X.

Can you refer us to an earlier build known to work on Parallels? I'd
like to be able to touch Sugar before Wednesday.
