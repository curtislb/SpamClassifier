Hi Jeremy,

A smaller step size may or may not help.  If the issue is simply truncation
error, that is the error involved in discretizing the differential
equations, then a smaller step size would help.  If, however, the true
solution to the differential equation is negative, for some t, then the
numerical solution should also be negative.  If the negative solution does
not make sense, then the system of equation needs to be examined to see when
and why negative solutions arise.  Perhaps, I am just making this up - there
needs to be a "barrier function" that slows down the trajectory as it
approaches zero from its initial value. It is also possible that only
certain regions of the parameter space are allowed in the sense that only
there the solution is feasible for all t.  So, in your example, the
parameters might not be realistic.  In short, if you are sure that the
numerical solution is accurate, then you need to go back to your system of
equations and analyze them carefully.


Ravi.

Hi Spencer,
I have copied Woody Setzer. I have no idea whether lsoda can estimate  
parameters that could take imaginary values.

Hmm. I have no idea.
