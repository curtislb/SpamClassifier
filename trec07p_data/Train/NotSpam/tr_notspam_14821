Hi Terrence,
you need Speech-Dispatcher, speechd-up and a synth of your choice to do 
this. Ubuntu comes with Festival, which is supported by 
Speech-dispatcher. You can add supported synts, such as Festival-Lite or 
Espeak.
Install Speech-Dispatcher and Speechd-up, and then check the following 
files to set SD up:
/etc/speech-dispatcher/speechd.conf
and
/etc/speech-dispatcher/modules/yoursynth.conf
that means search in that directory for the file that configures the 
synth of your choice.
It runs without any problems on a less powerful machine; I use a 1 Ghz 
AMD-Duron with 240 MBs of RAM. Problems with slow processors and not 
enugh memory start when you use Gnome with Orca. But that's a different 
story.
Hermann
