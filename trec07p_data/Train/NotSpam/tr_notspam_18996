You mean "Perl". What table and what images? I don't know whether your
table is in a spreadsheet, a database, a web page, or your kitchen.

Be sure to check the return value from open, so that you know that it
has succeeded.

It may be a good idea to check the return value of read as well. Why
are you asking for such a large amount of data at once? Do you want to
read the entire file, or merely the first 512K?

I can't see what you're trying to do, or how it's not working for you.
Can you show us the code? Cut it down to a small example that other
people could try to run, and somebody will be able to guide you
further.

Good luck with it!
