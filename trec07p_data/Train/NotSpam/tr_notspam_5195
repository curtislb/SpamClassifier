VIRTUAL REALITY
By Tony Lopez
Novartis sues India on patents

The giant Swiss drug multinational Novartis’ challenge to India’s
patent laws could seriously reduce, if not cut the supply of affordable
medicines to treat AIDS and other epidemics in poor countries.

India changed its patent laws in 2005 to comply with a global agreement
on intellectual property. Subsequently, Novar­tis applied for a patent.
It is one of the first under the new rules. It is for its leukemia
anticancer drug Glivec.

In January 2006 India’s patent office rejected the application.
Novartis protested and sued in court. It is also challenging India’s
patent laws, claiming that they do not comply with the international
agreement.

The trial opened in Madras. The main issue is the question of
innovation. India’s patent law requires that drugs be “new and involve
an inventive step” in order to win patent protection.

NGOs including Medécins Sans Frontiéres (MSF) and Oxfam say that if
Novartis succeeds, pharmaceutical firms will be able to put newer AIDS
treatments based on existing drugs under patent protection in India,
preventing cheap generic versions being exported to Africa and
elsewhere.

India became the “pharmacy of the world’s poor” in 1970 when it stopped
issuing drug patents, allowing its many drug producers to create
generic copies of medicines still patent-protected in other
countries—at a fraction of the price charged by multinational drug
behemoths. In 1994, however, New Delhi became signatory to the
Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights
(Trips), a deal which required all WTO member countries to grant
patents on technological products, including pharmaceuticals, by 2005.

This prompted drug firms to queue up to patent their brands in India.
Up to 9,000 patents await examination. Glivec was one of the first to
go to court.

Novartis’ bid was rejected because it was judged to be merely a new
version of an older medicine. The Swiss company argues that India’s
requirement for drugs to be new and innovative is not in line with the
TRIPS.

  It is not clear whether the Glivec case would set a precedent allowing
other modified drugs to be patented in India. “There are an estimated
9,000 patent applications waiting to be reviewed, of which some 7,000
are said to be modifications of old drugs,” says Richard English,
manager of Oxfam’s Make Trade Fair campaign. “If Novartis wins,
countless medicines previously available cheaply to poor people could
then be patented and priced out of reach.”

While the company sells the drug at a price of Rs 1,200,000, Indian
companies retail it at Rs 8,000. NGOs say the outcome of the case could
have a profound effect on the accessibility to generic medicines in the
developing world.

Glivec is considered a breakthrough therapy for treating Chronic
Myeloid Leukemia.

In challenging the Indian patent law, Novartis in effect is saying any
variation of an existing drug is patentable. Also patentable will be
new uses of existing drugs or even new combinations or delivery systems
of existing drugs might be patentable.

Meanwhile, Medécins Sans Frontiéres is said to have collected some
300,000 signatures worldwide to pressure Novartis to drop its case.

MSF says generic manufacturers have helped bring the cost of AIDS
treatment down from $10,000 per patient per year in 2000, to just $130
now.

“The Glivec case is a litmus test,” said US Chamber of Commerce’s
senior vice president Daniel Christman.

“If India chooses to protect the intellectual property of Novartis, it
will help open a floodgate of investment into India’s pharmaceutical
industry, propelling India onto center stage as a destination for
innovation, R & D, and breakthrough medicine,” he said.

The Berne Declaration, Ox­farm International and the international
medical humanitarian organization Medécins Sans Frontiéres have
emphasized that Novartis is challenging countries’ rights to have
patent laws that put the interest of people first.

“The Doha Declaration tries to find a balance between intellectual
property rights and public health,” said Ruth Dreifuss, who chaired the
2004-06 WHO Commission on Intellectual Property Rights, Innovation and
Public Health (CIPIH). “The balance can be achieved only of countries
make use of the flexibilities contained in the TRIPS Agreement, and
this is what the Indian law does. By challenging it, Novartis is
sacrificing public health objectives and weakening the whole system.”

Many developing countries rely on affordable medicines. Over half the
AIDS drugs used in the developing world are generics. India has been
able to produce affordable versions of medicines patented elsewhere
because until 2005, the country did not grant pharmaceutical patents
