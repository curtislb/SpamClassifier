Glad to hear it.

It is currently hard to figure this out in the current documentation though.

Yes, that's definitely something I'm working on for the book.
Unfortunately, I don't have
 that much time and it is a lot of work.  Every comment helps though.

It's pretty young still, although the precursor ggplot package has
been around for about a year.  I really have no idea how many users
there are.  For questions, either email me or R-help.

Because it works with the grid drawing package - see the last chapter
in the ggplot book for some details on how to use the grid
equivalents.

The legends aren't very customisable at the moment - look at the
examples for the scale functions to see what you can do.  You can see
the name of the title easily, and you can change the labels by
changing the level of the factors, or setting the breaks argument.  I
agree there could be more options.  If you could provide me with a
picture of what you want, I'll add it to my to do list to think about.

Again, change the order of the underlying factor.

The strip is the labelled associated with the facet.

I do appreciate your comments and they definitely help me to make a
better product.

Thanks,
