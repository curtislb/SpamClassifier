						<b>THE EDGWARE DISSIDENT</b>
<br>

<br>
Newsnight understands that one man, living in Edgware, may be masterminding=
 a political campaign which could keep Pakistan's President Musharraf in po=
wer. Altaf Hussain is the leader of the Muttahida Quami Movement - MQM. He =
directs his flock via phone - when he talks thousands gather round in Pakis=
tan to listen to him on loudspeaker.=20
<br>

<br>
But his critics - amongst them cricket legend turned opposition politician =
Imran Khan - say he shouldn't even be here. He accuses the British Governme=
nt of giving sanctuary to a man whose party he alleges was linked to recent=
 violence in Pakistan. Tonight we'll look at the Edgware operation, and spe=
ak to Imran Khan in Islamabad.=20
<br>

<br>
<b>GB TOUR</b>
<br>

<br>
Yesterday a softer, humbler sounding Prime Minister elect said he wanted to=
 win back trust for the Labour Party and listen to the country.  So we take=
 to the road for the GB tour to see what he really means and indeed what th=
e country's saying.=20
<br>

<br>
We kick off in Basildon, a bell weather constituency which was Tory under T=
hatcher and Labour under Blair. What do they make of Zombie?
<br>

<br>
<b>GOOD DAY FOR BURYING AWKWARD NEWS?</b>
<br>

<br>
MPs have just passed a controversial bill to exempt themselves and peers fr=
om freedom of information laws. What does this mean in practice? It means a=
ll of us - voters, media, the public at large, will have a much harder time=
 finding out the truth from them. Just how does this fit into Zombie Brown'=
s new attempt to build trust?=20
<br>

<br>
<b>WEMBLEY</b>
<br>

<br>
We've almost forgotten how many years late it is but tomorrow the stadium w=
ill officially open. We have an interview with Michael Cunnah, the former C=
EO of Wembley who oversaw the building project. And we ask what the organiz=
ers of the Olympic Games should be learning from Wembley's mistakes.=20
<br>

<br>
Do join us at 10:30pm on BBC2.
<br>

<br>

=09=09=09=09=09
					And on Newsnight Review, Natalie Haynes, Grayson Perry, Denise Mina an=
d Tony Parsons will be here to give their verdict on the week's cultural re=
leases:
<br>
=20
<br>
<B>ZODIAC</B>
<br>

<br>
David Fincher's new film Zodiac, starring Mark Ruffalo, Jake  Gyllenhaal, a=
nd Robert Downey Jr is based on the real story of the California serial kil=
ler who brought terror to the area for more than a decade and who taunted t=
he police and the press with codes, ciphers, calls and letters but who was =
never caught.
<br>
=20
<br>
<B>ANTONY GORMLEY</B>
<br>

<br>
Antony Gormley's retrospective at the Hayward Gallery in London has been he=
ralded by the appearance of 31 life size cast iron figures on the roofs in =
sight of the gallery; an installation called Event Horizon, while inside th=
ere is selection of both new and older iconic pieces. The centrepiece is Bl=
ind Light, a glass room, into which visitors literally disappear in a vapou=
r cloud.  It is a disconcerting experience - I was reminded of almost getti=
ng lost in the mist on Goatfell on the island of Arran.
<br>
=20
<br>
<B>WHAT IS THE WHAT by DAVE EGGERS</B>
<br>

<br>
Dave Eggers' new book What is the What is an unexpected novel from the writ=
er whose calling card was A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius, but th=
is too is a kind of memoir. It is the result of collaboration with Valentin=
o Achak Deng, from southern Sudan who was finally resettled in America in 2=
001 after many hellish years in African refugee camps.=20=20
<br>

<br>
At the age of six or seven he became one of the thousands of Sudanese "Lost=
 Boys" who trekked thousands of kilometres through unimaginable terror - be=
headings, slaying of children, children dying of hunger and thirst, or kill=
ed by lions - to flee the militias of the Arab led government in Khartoum, =
who attacked the African population during the Second Sudanese Civil War.
<br>
=20
<br>
<B>RUFUS WAINWRIGHT - RELEASE THE STARS</B>
<br>

<br>
And finally, Rufus Wainwright's new album Release the Stars finds him in a =
more restrained and happier place than before, and with music perhaps desti=
ned to bring him the commercial success that has eluded him so far. But as =
ever the music is both personal and political including the lyrics, "I'm so=
 tired of America."=20
