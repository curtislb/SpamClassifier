In Trade Deal, a Shift on Generics

*Agreement Opens the Door To Cheaper Drugs Abroad,  Easing Some Patent Rules
*

*By SARAH LUECK*

*Wall Street Journal, **May 17, 2007; Page A4*

WASHINGTON -- A new trade agreement between Congress and the White House
contains provisions that open the door to more sales of generic drugs in
developing countries. The plan, reversing earlier gains for American drug
makers backed by President Bush, marks the first big setback for the
pharmaceutical industry since Democrats claimed Capitol Hill.

For now, the provisions likely only affect pending trade deals with Peru,
Panama and Colombia. But the plan also signals a broader shift as
congressional leaders give greater weight in trade talks to providing
cheaper medicines for the poor, even if it means denying the
Republican-friendly drug industry some of the protection it says it needs.

The administration "has permitted the weakening of intellectual-property
protections in these agreements," said Billy Tauzin, president of the
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the drug industry's
main trade group, in an interview. "They were desperate to get continuing
trade authority" from Democrats in Congress, he said. "The fact is, their
leverage changed since November."

The main focus of the bipartisan trade deal, announced last week, involves
requiring U.S. trade partners to meet new standards for giving their workers
labor rights and ensuring environmental protections. But the deal also
allows developing countries more flexibility in dealing with U.S. drug
makers than they would have had under earlier versions.

Specifically, the policy would ease requirements on developing-country
regulators to prevent the sale of patent-infringing products. It also
releases trading partners from a requirement to extend the time for patent
protections as a form of compensation for delays in drug approvals.

Public-health advocacy groups have argued for years that U.S. trade policy
under Mr. Bush often protected brand-name drug makers at the expense of poor
countries in need of more-affordable treatments. Many of those groups said
they weren't satisfied with last week's deal. Even with the changes, they
say, the Peru and Panama deals advance many of the protections the drug
industry wants -- just fewer than would have existed if the Bush
administration had stuck with its earlier trade stance.

*"Compared to the many steps backward that have been taken since 2003, this
is a bit of relief for people who want access to affordable medicines," said
Ellen Shaffer, co-director of the Center for Policy Analysis on Trade and
Health in San Francisco. "Compared to an actual policy that would provide
affordable medicines for people and fairly balance that with innovation, it
is a small step forward."*

Trade is just one of many fronts where the pharmaceutical industry faces a
less friendly policy environment, after enjoying strong support during years
of undivided Republican rule. Some Democrats want to rewrite the Medicare
prescription-drug benefit to allow the government to negotiate lower prices
with manufacturers. Some Democrats also want to legalize imports of cheaper
medications from Canada and other countries. The Bush administration has
maintained its support for the industry on those issues, and the Senate has
blocked those policy changes.

But on exports, the administration last week changed course. For the last
several years, U.S. trade officials and drug companies have worked to push
new protections for drug makers in countries such as signers of the Central
American Free Trade Agreement.

Companies say stronger safeguards for their patents and proprietary data are
needed in many countries, to delay generic competition and make it
worthwhile for the industry to continue to invest in research and
development of new treatments.

Under the new American trade strategy, the biggest loss for the industry is
a change that may shift more responsibility to drug makers for preventing
the marketing of patent-infringing products.

Under recent trade agreements, the U.S. pressed countries to agree to
"linkage," which requires local drug regulators to make sure a generic
product doesn't violate any patents before allowing it on the market.
Public-health advocacy groups have said this puts makers of brand-name drugs
at an advantage and burdens regulators. Drug companies support linkage
because it prevents copies of their products from being sold during lengthy
court battles. Without it, companies will have to be more vigilant. To take
industry concerns into account, the new policy calls for countries to set up
fast procedures for resolving patent disputes.

Another change in the new trade policy would weaken a common provision in
past trade agreements: that local regulators "shall" compensate drug makers
for delays in the process of approving their products, by awarding extra
time to sell their products free from competition.

Some Democrats said this unfairly penalizes consumers in those countries for
slow bureaucracies. A description of the changes to the Peru and Panama
agreements says countries "may" extend a company's patent to make up for
delays, suggesting more flexibility on what they are required to do to
compensate drug makers.

Health-advocacy groups complain the new policy still preserves the
data-exclusivity provision used to block generic competition. In many
countries, including the U.S., makers of generic drugs can often win
approval by proving their products are equivalent to the original drugs. In
that process, regulators use test data submitted by makers of brand-name
drugs. The data-exclusivity provision typically prevents such use of the
data for five years, acting as an effective hurdle for generics. The new
policy does, however, place more restrictions on the five-year data
exclusivity than previously existed in the Panama and Peru agreements.
