There's no reason, from what you've told us.  chomp() would have no
effect on that variable, as it doesn't end in a newline.  My guess is
that either you're leaving out an important detail for the sake of
brevity, or your coworker changed something else too, but mistakenly
believed it was the chomp() that solved the problem.

Can you create a short-but-complete script that demonstrates the
original failure, and then a version that has only the additional
chomp() line inserted but suddenly works correctly?

Also, what is meant by "it doesn't work" in your question?  What did
not work?  How did it not work?  What errors did you receive?
