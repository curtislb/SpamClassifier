In the past, USA for Innovation has been one of the louder voices
attacking Brazil.

Also, Ken Adelman's wife, Carol works at the Hudson Institute, where she
has authored a number of industry-friendly pieces.  She is perhaps best
known for her paper which concluded generics ARVs cost more than brand
name ARVs.
(http://spp.hudson.org/files/publications/AdelmanARVWhitePaper.pdf)  She
has also attacked generic ARVs as being unsafe.
