The opposit: your work is known to seek the corners of the language
which hurt most.  So please ignore those callers in the dark, which are
apparently poorly informed.

Recently, I also had a few encounters with grumpy mongers, which, simply
based on the fact that they feel more important, feel the need to insult
or ignore other people.  Especially, the word "Freedom" is used a lot in
these flames, although the interpretation of that term is quite different,
World-wide.  What is acceptable for the sake of "Freedom"?
