That's because matchbox is not starting... And I *think* it's another 64 
bit specific bug.

It would be useful if you could try something like:

[marco@localhost sugar-jhbuild]$ ./sugar-jhbuild shell
[marco@localhost sugar-jhbuild]$ Xephyr :2 -ac &
[1] 14232
[marco@localhost sugar-jhbuild]$ DISPLAY=:2 matchbox-window-manager

And report the output. Also if you get a segfault, it would be good to 
run matchbox-window-manager under gdb and get a stack trace.

Thanks!

Marco
