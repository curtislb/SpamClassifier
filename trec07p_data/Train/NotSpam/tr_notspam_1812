All of the Perl* PMC types were changed into dynamically loaded PMCs  
- they're not available at runtime without jumping through some  
hoops. (These were designed for a more perl5-ian set of requirements,  
and weren't going to be used by the perl6-on-parrot effort.);

Most of the Perl types have builtin parrot analogues, however:

PerlArray -> ResizablePMCArray
PerlHash -> Hash
PerlString -> String
PerlInt -> Integer
PerlNum -> Float
PerlUndef -> Undef
PerlEnv -> Env

PerlScalar is kind of a base class for the string/int/num types, I'm  
not sure if there's a direct analogue in core parrot.

The old perl PMC stuff is still in the parrot repository for the  
moment in languages/perl5/.

Hope this helps, though I'm out of touch enough with Pugs that I  
don't know if this is related to something in pugs-land that needs  
updating.
