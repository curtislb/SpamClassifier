Dear MSN

 

I enclose a press release made by the Public Monuments and Sculpture
Association [PMSA] which may be of interest to your audience since it
creates a precedent for protecting post-war public art in the UK which
is attached to a structure and under 30 years old. 

 

Thanks,

Map thief ordered to pay $2.3 million in restitution
 

Associated Press - May 22, 2007 6:14 PM ET 

NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - A renowned dealer who admitted stealing about 100
rare antique maps has been ordered to pay $$2.3 million in restitution to
his victims.

The money will go to map dealers and libraries in Boston, Connecticut, New
York, Maine and Britain.

E Forbes Smiley the Third was sentenced in September to 3.5 years in prison
after one librarian described him as a thief who assaulted history.

He was tentatively ordered to pay restitution of $$1.9 million, but that
figure was changed after the parties worked to recover the maps and assess
their value.

Whether Smiley's victims will receive the money depends on his ability to
pay after he gets out of prison and the government's ability to sell his
assets.

Prosecutors said in court papers that 96 maps have been recovered and four
remain missing.

Elgin Marbles Parliamentary Motion Hailed
Monday, 28 May 2007, 12:02 pm
Press Release: NZ Parthenon Marbles Committee  
27 May 2007
Parthenon (Elgin) Marbles Parliamentary Motion Hailed

"The motion passed last Thursday by members of New Zealand's Parliament,
which urges the British Government to return the Parthenon (Elgin) Marbles
back to Greece, joins the growing number of countries and international
organisations also calling for their return" said Bruce Blades, Chairman of
the New Zealand Parthenon Marbles Committee.

"The Marble sculptures were sawn off and stripped from the Parthenon
building on the Acropolis in Athens by the then British Ambassador Lord
Elgin 200 years ago, at the time when Greece was under Turkish rule. This
action has been a matter of deep controversy ever since. Lord Elgin sold the
Marbles to the British Government which holds them in the British Museum.
Half are in Athens and half are in London. Countries throughout the world
are joining the call for the Marbles to be reunited so that the magnificence
of these sculptures can be truly appreciated in the place of their origin."

The text of the motion put forward reads:-

"That this House joins its voice to that of other countries throughout the
world and urges the British Government to support the return of the
Parthenon (Elgin) marbles to Greece, stressing the need for the collections
of marbles in different locations to be reunited so the world can see them
in their original context in relation to the Temple of Parthenon as an act
of respect to one of the most significant monuments of western heritage."

The motion was agreed to.

"As long as the Marbles remain in the British Museum, our New Zealand
Committee will continue to inform the public of the plunder carried out by
Lord Elgin when he desecrated the classical Parthenon building" said Mr
Blades.

Christie's To Sell $20 Million Raphael Portrait on July 5 
 
 


Raffaello Sanzio, called Raphael (Urbino 1483-1520 Rome), Portrait of
Lorenzo de? Medici (1492-1519), Duke of Urbino, oil on canvas, 38 x 31 in.
(97 x 79 cm). Estimate: ?10,000,000 ? 15,000,000. ? Christie's Images
Limited:
http://www.artdaily.com/section/news/index.asp?int_sec=2&int_new=20380 

 
LONDON.- Christie's will offer a masterpiece by Raffaello Sanzio, called
Raphael (1483-1520) at the auction of Important Old Master and British
Pictures on 5 July 2007 in London. One of only a handful of paintings by the
artist to remain in private hands, the work portrays Lorenzo de? Medici,
Duke of Urbino and ruler of Florence from 1513 to 1519, and has not been
seen in public for over 40 years. The most important Renaissance portrait to
be offered at auction for a generation, and the most important work by the
artist to be offered at auction in recent decades, it is expected to realize
between ?10,000,000-15,000,000. 

Richard Knight, International Director of Christie?s Old Master Department
and Paul Raison, Director and Head of Old Master Pictures at Christie's,
London: ?Building on Christie?s continuing leadership of the market for old
master paintings, we are excited to offer in London this remarkable work by
Raphael, one of the most renowned and accomplished of European artists. The
importance of the artist and the sitter, together with the provenance and
the historical context behind this painting?s creation, make it one of the
most significant old master pictures to be offered at auction for a
generation. We look forward to exhibiting this remarkable painting to the
public from 30 June to 5 July at our King Street salerooms in London.? 

The portrait shows a swagger Lorenzo de? Medici standing proud and
resplendent against a rich green background. In the Duke?s right hand he
holds what is probably a portrait miniature showing his future wife, and his
striking tunic and shawl of gold and red are of the most impressive order
with the fur on the neck and lining of his cape painted in a delicate manner
which highlights Raphael?s exceptional ability and technique. The vivacity
and boldness of the colors, together with the handling of the abundance of
fabrics worn by the Duke, are typical of the style of the Renaissance master
and substantiate his being known as ?the Prince of Painters. 

The portrait is recorded in the possession of Cosmo de Medici, Grand Duke of
Tuscany, in an inventory of 1553. During the 1800s, it was in the possession
of two of the most prominent collectors of the 19th century; Lord Northwick
(1769-1859) whose collection was offered at auction in 1859, and then the
merchant Hollingworth Magniac (1786-1867) whose collection was sold over an
eleven day sale at Christie?s in 1892 where the present picture, lot 84,
sold for 567 guineas. The painting was the subject of attributional debate
with regards both the artist and the sitter from 1862, although Sir Charles
Robinson (1824-1913), the esteemed scholar of Italian Renaissance art,
supported the attribution as it is accepted today. It was sold again at
Christie?s in November 1962 and in 1968 it was sold at an auction in New
York to Ira Spanierman, in whose possession it remains to the present day.
In 1971, Professor Konrad Oberhuber conclusively reinstated the attribution
of the painting in an article for The Burlington Magazine, a view now
accepted by all major scholars of the artist. 

THE MEDICI FAMILY 

The Medici family ruled Florence from the 14th to the 17th centuries and
provided many of the greatest patrons of the High Renaissance; Donatello,
Filippo Lippi, Botticelli, Raphael, Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo
Buonarroti all received the patronage of the Medici family, one of the
wealthiest families in Europe. The Medici also held great power through a
series of appointments, conquests and strategic marriages. One such
appointment was that of Giovanni di Lorenzo de' Medici (1475-1521), second
son of Lorenzo the Magnificent, who was elected Pope Leo X in 1513. Seeking
to consolidate the position of the Medici family on an international stage,
the Pope arranged for his nephew, Lorenzo, to be married to Madeleine de la
Tour d?Auvergne, a cousin of Francois I, King of France, an important ally
of the Vatican against the Holy Roman Empire. As neither the Duke nor the
bride-to-be had met, an exchange of portraits was arranged in order that
they could see what to expect. 

On 2 May 1518 the Duke was married in the ch?teau of Amboise in France.
Returning to Florence with his bride, their entry to the city was celebrated
with a banquet at which Raphael?s portrait of the Pope, now in the Uffizi,
Florence, was exhibited. The couple had a child, Catherine de Medici, who
went on to marry King Henry II of France, but less than a year after the
marriage, the Duchess died. Lorenzo died soon afterwards in 1519. 

RAPHAEL 

Raffaello Sanzio, called Raphael (1483-1520) was one of the most important
artists of the High Renaissance and one of the most influential and
accomplished painters in European history. Born in Urbino in 1483, he was
orphaned by the age of 11 and sent to the care of his uncle. He lived in
Florence from 1504 to 1508 where he absorbed the influence of his great
contemporaries Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo. In 1508, he was summoned
to Rome by Pope Julius II and commissioned to paint frescos in one of the
Papal rooms in the Vatican. He spent most of his life in Rome under the
patronage of Julius II and his successor, Leo X, the uncle of Lorenzo Medici
whose portrait is to be offered at Christie?s in July. According to the
great biographer Giorgio Vasari, Pope Leo X ?wept bitterly when he died? in
1520, and had planned to make him a cardinal. 

The auction of Important Old Master and British Pictures on 5 July 2007 will
also offer Part Two of the Goudstikker Collection, arguably the most
important collection of Old Master pictures ever restituted. Following on
from Part One which took place on 19 April in New York and totaled
$9,741,200, the collection is an overview of Dutch Old Master pictures from
the 15th to 19th centuries, together with excellent examples from 16th
century Germany, early Italian and 18th century French works. On 5 July, the
Goudstikker Collection Part Two will offer 35 lots, highlighted by an
altarpiece by The Master of the Pauw and Zas alterpiece, circa 1520, which
is expected to realize ?1,000,000 to 1,500,000, and The Plaats, the Hague,
with an elegant hawking party by Gerrit Berckheyde (1638-1698) (estimate:
?200,000-400,000). 

The auction will also offer a masterpiece by the Baroque master Domenico
Zampieri, Il Domenichino (1581-1641). The Piet?, which was exhibited at the
recent exhibition Domenichino 1581-1641 at the Palazzo Venezia, Rome from
October 1996 to January 1997, is expected to realize ?2,500,000 to
3,500,000. Leading the selection of important British pictures is a
masterpiece by Sir Peter Lely (1618-1680) traditionally considered to depict
a favored mistress of King Charles II, and thought to have been a work owned
by the King and kept in the Royal bedchamber at the Palace of Whitehall.
Portrait of a young lady and child as Venus and Cupid by Sir Peter Lely, the
finest painter of the Restoration and official artist to Charles II, is
being offered at the auction by the Trustees of the Denys Eyre Bower Bequest
and is expected to realize ?1,500,000-2,000,000. Another highlight of the
sale is the swagger Portrait of Philip Gell (1723-1795) by Sir Joshua
Reynolds, P.R.A. (1723-1792) which carries an estimate of
?1,500,000-2,500,000.

IMA ?uvres vol?es puis retrouv?es 


La plupart des ?uvres d'art qui avaient disparu des r?serves de l'Institut
du monde arabe (IMA) ? Paris ont ?t? retrouv?es par la police ? l'int?rieur
m?me de l'?tablissement, a-t-on appris jeudi aupr?s de la pr?sidence de
l'IMA. 
?Des investigations conduites par la police ont permis de retrouver
l'essentiel des ?uvres. Nous ne sommes plus du tout sur les m?mes chiffres?,
a indiqu? ? l'AFP le pr?sident de l'IMA, Dominique Baudis. 
?Sur 38 ?uvres d'art islamique, notamment des tableaux et lithographies,
dont la disparition avait ?t? signal?e d?but mai ? la suite d'un inventaire,
deux seulement restaient manquantes jeudi, ainsi que 12 ?uvres d'art
contemporain sur 39 signal?es manquantes?, a pr?cis? le pr?sident de l'IMA.

?Il y a encore quelques manques mais nous avons espoir que les ?uvres seront
retrouv?es?, a soulign? M. Baudis, ?voquant ?un probl?me d'application des
proc?dures?. 
Par alleurs, directeur du mus?e  depuis plus de 20 ans,M. Brahim Alaoui a
?t? sujet d?une  mise ? pied ? titre conservatoire et avec interdiction

entretien au cours duquel il devra s'expliquer sur la disparition des ?uvres
et la pr?sence ? l'IMA d'autres pi?ces non r?pertori?es. 
L'inventaire avait en effet r?v?l? la pr?sence d'environ 250 ?uvres ne
figurant pas sur les registres du mus?e et  o? elles  ?taient pourtant
entrepos?es dans un local technique probablement depuis des ann?es. 
Une plainte pour vol avait ?t? d?pos?e d?but mai aupr?s du parquet de Paris
?afin d'?valuer les faits et de d?fendre les int?r?ts de l'IMA?.  ?La
situation est moins grave que ce qui nous avait ?t? dit. Il n'en demeure pas
moins qu'il y a des pratiques et des m?thodes qui doivent ?tre examin?es de

prochain renforcement des mesures de s?curit?. 
Dans une interview au Figaro de jeudi, M. Alaoui reconna?t ?une certaine
n?gligence administrative? et pr?cise que les ?uvres non r?pertori?es ?sont
avant tout des d?p?ts d'artistes? auxquels il a voulu ?rendre service?. 
Il souligne que des toiles de ma?tres ont ?t? pr?t?es ces 15 derni?res

Cooling U.S. Market Sends Tomb Raiders Elsewhere

Part One
  
U.S. federal agents report that the looting of the world's archaeological
sites is epidemic. One archaeologist working in Guatemala has launched a
battle to save an ancient city from the ravages of looters.
  
Hear that Story:
http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10457558 
  
Part Two
  
The rules have changed for museums, dealers, collectors and auction houses.
Looted relics have become as contentious as they are beautiful. In Part Two
of this report, we examine the tomb robbers' global marketplace.


 
 Morning Edition, May 29, 2007 . They say the world's second oldest
profession is tomb raiding.

In the jungles of northern Guatemala - where the lowland Maya created
stunning jewelry, ceramics and reliefs - there was no one better than Ramon
Peralta. He was a huechero - a tomb looter.

"If an archaeologist leaves a site, the looters are going to come because he
knows it's an interesting site. 'Oh, that's where the gringos went! Man, it
has to be an important site. There has to be something there,'" Peralta
says.

Like a computer hacker who goes to work for Microsoft, Peralta quit looting
five years ago and now serves as a guide for the Wildlife Conservation
Society in the vast Peten Province.

He slouches in a chair with a wry smile creasing his copper-colored face.

"This is never gonna end, never gonna end. Forget it. Peten is huge and
anywhere you go in Peten, you'll find monticulos and ruins and other sites,
and it's just always going to continue," Peralta says.

The reason it will continue - not just in Guatemala, but in China,
Afghanistan, Cambodia, Nigeria and Mali, to name just a few countries - is
because of the demand, says Richard Leventhal, an archaeologist at the
University of Pennsylvania and a leading voice in the movement to curtail
the trade in looted antiquities.

"I think the connection must be made that the people are looting to look for
spectacular objects because there is an art market that will gobble them up
and sell them around the world to private dealers and to museums," Leventhal
says.

The modern world has made the sacking of archaeological sites even easier -
with containerized shipping, overnight mail, Internet auctions and email.

War and civil conflict leave ancient sites and museums unprotected. In the
most vivid example, 14,000 pieces were ransacked from the Iraq Museum.
Matthew Bogdanos, a reserve Marine colonel who helped investigate and
recover some of the relics, says he was astounded by the global black market
he discovered.

"That includes the smugglers on the first leg of the journey outside the
country, be it Jordan, Egypt or Iraq. That also includes the individuals who
provide the false documentation - the provenance - that gets it on its way
to a dealer in Beirut, Geneva or Dubai. That includes the dealers. And that
ultimately includes the end-user, the collector - individuals whose names
you would recognize from society pages," Bogdanos says.

The looting of the Iraq Museum helped draw attention to the scope of the
illegal trade in antiquities. The FBI responded by creating a rapid
deployment Art Crime Team. U.S. Customs and Border Protection has begun
training its inspectors, though a senior agent guesses they only catch 5
percent of what's smuggled into the country. What's more, the federal
government has signed bilateral agreements with 11 countries that allow it
to seize and repatriate stolen antiquities at the border.

But the most effective measure has been targeting the marketplace, says
Roger Atwood, a journalist who wrote a book on the subject titled Stealing
History.

"If we are talking about this as a law enforcement issue, the most sensible
way to deal with it is to deal with it at the buyer end where it's much more
concentrated. At the supply end, it's much more diffused and difficult to
control," Atwood said.

The buyers - auction houses, dealers, collectors and museums - have been
feeling the pressure particularly from Italy.

In recent years, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the J. Paul
Getty Museum of Art in Los Angeles agreed to return artworks believed stolen
from Italian soil. And in the most watched case, prominent art dealer Robert
Hecht Jr. and former Getty museum curator Marian True are on trial in Italy
for conspiracy to traffic in illegal antiquities.

"I think if the Italians are successful against Marion True, it'll have
phenomenal impact on how the larger institutions conduct their business to
move this out of the dark ages," said Jim McAndrew, the top art-crime cop
with U.S. Customs & Border Protection.

Traditionally, museums have acquired cultural material because it is
beautiful or important, with little regard for how it was obtained. Think of
the Earl of Elgin hauling the Parthenon Marbles out of Athens in 1806.

"There were empires, there was war, there was booty taken. To the victor
went the spoils, and the museums of the world still represent the
dispositions of some of those historical events. We are now living in this
different world, and we are requiring more provenance history, and if we
think it was recently excavated, we're just not going to buy it," said
Timothy Potts, director of the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth.

The key word he uses is provenance - the history of an object's ownership.

Sotheby's, the largest auction house in the world, used to be notorious for
buying unprovenanced antiquities, some of which were illegitimate.
Punctuating the new chill in the art world, last year, Sotheby's hired as
its worldwide director of compliance the former federal art-crime prosecutor
in New York.

In this new climate, every relic has to have a paper trail or it's
considered pillage - an assumption that some see as overreacting.

Torkom Demirjian, the Turkish-born owner of Ariadne Galleries, sits in the
parlor of his elegant townhouse/gallery on the Upper East Side of New York.
His left elbow rests casually on a fifth-century Byzantine pillar. He's
tired of dealers and their customers getting blamed for somehow encouraging
the destruction of archaeological sites.

"Americans who buy them, they don't buy these things to destroy or to cause
harm. You love something, you protect it. So the issue is, is it good or bad
for a work of art to come to America, as opposed to going elsewhere or going
nowhere?"

The sad reality, Demirjian and other experts said, is that the crackdown on
illegal antiquities in this country has had an unintended consequence. It
has diverted the spoils of tomb raiding from the United States to markets in
Europe and Japan, where enforcement is more lax.
