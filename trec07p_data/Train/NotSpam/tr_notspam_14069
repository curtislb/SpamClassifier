Thailand to override more patented drugs-minister

By Chalathip Thirasoonthrakul

BANGKOK, May 28 (Reuters) - Thailand, which has overridden international
patents on three drugs in the past year, plans to issue two more local
licences this year for copycat versions of medicines, Health Minister
Mongkol na Songkhla said on Monday.

The new licenses would be for the country's top killing diseases,
especially cancer, Mongkol told reporters, but declined to name them.

"In the remaining six months I have left, we will do it on the drugs
that are needed to save the lives of the poor," said Mongkol, referring
to the term of the interim army-appointed government due to expire after
elections in December.

"Altogether, we will impose compulsory licensing on up to five necessary
drugs," said Mongkol, who failed to win a sympathetic ear from trade
officials in Washington last week.

Thailand is negotiating with French and American makers of two HIV/AIDS
drugs and a heart medicine to lower their prices after Bangkok overrode
patents.

The compulsory licensing, which Thailand says is legal under the World
Trade Organisation's rules, has drawn flak from global drug makers and
Washington, but applause from HIV/AIDS advocacy groups.

Mongkol urged drug companies to charge a range of prices for one
medicine so that rich and poor would have the same access to the same drug.

"This is not a threat, but an appeal to the drug companies to have
sympathy for the poor. One price for the rich and one price for the
poor. At the end, it will be win-win for everyone."

Mongkol said there was progress in haggling with two makers of the three
drugs to get prices down closer to their generic equivalents, but not
with Abbott Laboratories <ABT.N>, which makes the HIV/AIDS drug Kaletra.

Abbott refused to budge on its offer of $1,000 per patient per year for
a heat-stable version of the drug during negotiations with Thai
officials this month.

Aluvia is needed badly in tropical Thailand because it does not require
refrigeration like Kaletra, eliminating the need for costly cold storage.

Abbott recently cut its price for Kaletra and Aluvia to $1,000 per
patient per year in 40 low- and middle-income countries, but Thailand
says it is still too expensive.

Mongkol said Thailand would not scrap compulsory licensing on the three
drugs even if the patent owners agreed to sell their products at prices
close to generic ones because the rules allowed Thailand to buy generic
versions.

"We can't leave generic drugs out of our purchases. Without them,
patented drug makers will put price pressure on us again," Mongkol said.
