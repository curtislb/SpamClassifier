Last night, I ran 'make test' and everything was cool.  Tonight, I  
ran 'make test' and saw that a newly added test file, t/doc/ 
pod_todo.t, generated a massive number of lines of failure message.   
(See attached patch pod_todo.t.failure.txt.)  I experienced these  
failures in both trunk and the reconfigure/ branch.

I am just one of many Parrot hackers whose files were judged sound  
yesterday but are not labelled as defective today.  We now presumably  
have to go and fix each and every one of these files so that it meets  
whatever standards t/doc/pod_todo.t is imposing on them.

The test file in question was added just hours ago:

[t] Added a test checking for TODO items in Pod documentation.  This  
test
is based upon t/doc/pod.t and performs a similar role to
t/codingstd/fixme.t.

I googled the archives of our mailing list and found no matches for  
'pod_todo'.  So apparently there was no on-list discussion of this  
test before it was committed to trunk.  Given how many files it finds  
defective, shouldn't there have been some discussion -- or at least  
some warning -- before it was committed?

Thank you very much.
