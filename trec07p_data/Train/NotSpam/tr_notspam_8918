Hi folks,

I've been asked to write a job that sets up an SSH tunnel (ssh -L) which
forwards connections to a box on our client's internal network. Through
this tunnel I need to make a second SFTP connection for data transfer.

I've been looking at Net::SSH, but I haven't quite figured out how to
use it to set up the initial tunnel, or even if it's possible with this
module. Before I invest too much time, I thought I should find out if
anyone else has already invented this particular wheel :)

So...

Has anyone else done this? What modules should I be looking at?
Any tidbits or advice to put me on the right path would be appreciated.

Thanks!
