Perl 6 is not yet finished, so the the list of core modules is not yet
specified.

That's a general problem with libraries, not only Perl ones. And you
can't solve this by putting everything into core - it just blows up the
distribution.

Perl 6 does. See for example ext/Set/ in the pugs repository.
And so does Perl 5:

You could help by contributing some suggestions to what the new "Web"
module should be able to do, and how so. Web is hopefully "CGI done
right", and still in its early planning stage.
