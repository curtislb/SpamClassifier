Second-line drugs only hope for many 12,000 resistant
to first-line Aids drugs

APIRADEE TREERUTKUARKUL, Bangkok Post, 14 May 07

It's six o'clock in the morning and Supan Pankaew is
ready to go to the provincial hospital, about 20km
from her farmhouse in Si Sa Ket's Wang Hin district.
Once a month, the 39-year-old widow has to drive her
old motorbike to the hospital, where she has to wait
in a long queue to meet a doctor and receive anti-Aids
drugs.


''No one except people living with HIV/Aids knows how
hard it is to get access to medical treatment, whether
first-line or second-line drugs,'' said Pan, as she is
known to her family.


Her recent viral load test and CD4 count, which are
used to measure the level of HIV in the blood to
determine the stage of the disease, showed that her
condition has worsened and she needs to take
anti-retroviral medicine.


She contracted HIV/Aids from her husband nine years
ago. She is resistant to first-line drugs such as
GPO-VIR and the second-line drug Kaletra seems to be
the only hope for her.


Fortunately, last March she was listed as eligible to
receive Kaletra free of charge via the healthcare
scheme for employees of private firms supervised by
the Social Security Office.


Despite getting diarrhoea as a side-effect from the
new medication, she feels it is still better than
suffering from limp legs and arms, a side-effect of
GPO-VIR, which her body began to resist.


Pan is among a small group of 500 HIV-positive people
who can obtain the free Kaletra under the National
Access to Anti-retroviral Programme for People Living
with HIV/Aids.


The majority of the approximately 12,000 infected
people who have developed resistance to first-line
anti-retroviral treatment do not have such
opportunities.


HIV-positive people dependent on first-line medication
usually find themselves resistant to the drugs within
a few years.


''The state cannot afford the cost of treatment for
all people living with HIV/Aids who are resistant to
drugs as long as the prices of second-line drugs are
still too high,'' said Sombat Tanprasertsuk, director
of the Aids, Tuberculosis and Sexually-Transmitted
Diseases Bureau.


The market price of imported Kaletra is currently
about $2,200 (73,000 baht) per person per year.


However, the drug producer, Abbott Laboratories, has
offered to cut the price of Kaletra to $1,000 (32,500
baht) per patient per year if the government revokes
its compulsory licensing to bypass the drug's patent.


But the government said it would not make any decision
until its stockpile of Kaletra runs out, probably in
August.


Dr Sombat believes compulsory licensing, which
empowers the government to manufacture or import
generic versions of medicine, will help many more
people living with HIV/Aids who have developed
resistance to drugs prolong their lives.


The government spent about 3.8 billion baht in the
last fiscal year on HIV/Aids treatment for half a
million people living with the disease.


The compulsory licences issued on Jan 29 covered three
drugs used for treating Aids and heart disease _
Efavirenz, Kaletra and Plavix.


To seek more options in expanding access to such
drugs, Public Health Minister Mongkol na Songkhla went
to New York last week to sign an agreement with the
Clinton Foundation to buy a generic version of Aluvia,
an improved version of Kaletra, from the Indian
generic drug maker Matrix Laboratories for $695 per
person per year.


However, the government's efforts to acquire cheap
generic drugs for Aids patients in the country has
upset pharmaceutical giants and is believed to have
led to Thailand's downgrading in the US government's
Priority Watch List of countries with low protection
of intellectual property rights.


A US lobby group, reportedly supported by drug firms
affected by the compulsory licensing, has also
launched an advertising campaign against the policy
and the locally-made drug GPO-VIR.


Many Thai patients, including Pan, see this as the
company's way of taking revenge for the government's
decision to override the patents on the three drugs.


''What they are doing is cold-blooded. They know that
millions of people will die because they can't afford
expensive drugs. But these firms care more about
profits than anything else,'' she said.
