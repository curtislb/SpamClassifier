Late reply to one of the earlier posts on this subject. I had asked a 
question about how to get a installation of linux running in a vm, 
and, I have to say that I did get it working. It Turned out to be 
very easy, but, I was wondering about sound support in the vm as I 
was just using speakup through my serial port. It was kind of cool 
when I got it working as I was on skype on the windows host and it 
never gave me any trouble, but, I am guessing that getting some sort 
of software synth working would not work unless I had another 
soundcard to rout it through? I am not even sure if I can find 
drivers for my soundcard that is built into this laptop, but, that is 
a question for another time I suppose. If someone can tell me more 
about how this kind of thing works, that would be wonderful. I 
noticed that someone did get software speech going with a vm, so, 
figured I would ask.
Thanks bunches.
