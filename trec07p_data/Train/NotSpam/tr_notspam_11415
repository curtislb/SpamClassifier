Lou Dobbs Tonight
Thursday, May 17, 2007

Tonight, the Senate leadership on both sides of the aisle
reached a compromise with the White House on so-called
comprehensive immigration reform. The deal gives amnesty to
millions and millions of illegal aliens already living in the
United States. But opposition is building, and such a deal
would have to pass both houses to ever become law. Will it
pass? We’ll have the latest on this compromise tonight.

New Census numbers are out, and you’ll be surprised about where
this country is headed in terms of its population. So what is
the overall population growth in this country? What groups are
showing the biggest increases? What does this mean for
re-districting? Which groups are losing representation? And
what does it say about the millions of people who are not
counted? We’ll have the answers to these questions and many
more, tonight.

We’ll bring you a follow-up on the country of origin labeling
for food coming into the United States and to America’s dinner
tables. Are states continuing to do more than the Federal
Government on this important issue?

And more on Mexican border violence: 15 drug cartel members are
dead after a massive shootout in the streets of Mexico. One
Mexican policeman charged with guarding the scene of the
shooting said, “Am I scared? The whole world is scared.” What
are Mexican authorities doing to clean up the violence that has
spilled over into the United States?

Robert Pastor, director of American University's Center for
North American Studies, says he proposes a North American
Community, not a North American Union. What is the difference?
Either way, American voices are not being heard on this back
door deal. Robert Pastor will be our guest tonight.

And we'll be joined by political commentator Bay Buchanan to
discuss her new book, "The Extreme Makeover of Hillary (Rodham)
Clinton."
