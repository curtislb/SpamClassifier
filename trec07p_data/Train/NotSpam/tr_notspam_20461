Not with rbind.  With merge, if you have a suitable index column.
Using 2.5.1 beta:

> Day1 <- data.frame(x=1:2, id=1:2)
> Day2 <- data.frame(x=3:4, y=10:11, id=3:4)
> rbind(Day1, Day2)
Error in match.names(clabs, names(xi)) : names do not match previous names
> merge(Day1, Day2, all=TRUE)
   x id  y
1 1  1 NA
2 2  2 NA
3 3  3 10
4 4  4 11
