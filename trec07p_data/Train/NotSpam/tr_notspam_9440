We went from three vehicles to one. Ditched the hot rod and the 
secondary sedan.

My city was kind enough to supply one blue box (being sarcastic here). I 
upped it to three. Combine that with all of the fruits and veggies going 
into the composter, and our bag count at the curb has been cut in half.

We use those for cat litter. Keeps the smell down too.

We bought a dehumidifier, which uses way less energy than central air. 
The water from the dehumidifier is used in the laundry tub, so that 
doesn't go to waste.

Like you, the A/C is now reserved for the hottest of days only. Also, we 
didn't fix the A/C in the car when it broke down. For the three or four 
weeks a year it was being used, it's simply not a necessity.

Definitely.
