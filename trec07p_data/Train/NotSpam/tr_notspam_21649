Sounds like a bare Perl 6 distribution might be just what you need to
get them to weaken their restriction to "only modules with a good
cpanrating" or, best of all, "evaluate each module according to its
merits." Well, actually, I'm not sure that last one would be best, as
getting each module evaluating would almost inevitably entail getting
five or six high-up people together, none of whom have any interest in
you getting your job done, and who probably hate each others' guts, and
getting them to commit to some form of responsibility-generating paper-
trail.

Call me cynical if you like, but I prefer to call it, "experienced."
