Hi John,

I figured out the skipping of variables using a first subset & then making 
a second subset & it worked!

Thanks,

You need to have a look at Chapter 5 of the Intro to
R.   I would recommend downloading the pdf and
printing it out.  It is not an easy read but it should
help.

newdata <- mydata[, c(PUMDID, Y_Q10A)]

or
newdata <- mydata[, c(1,33)]

should do the trick
