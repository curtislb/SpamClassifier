It took Miles about 5 minutes to get up-and-running with the Gentoo 
developer's images (version 2) under the OSX VMWare beta.  I don't 
*think* he ever got networking working, however (he has been able to 
develop a game and started in another with that setup though, I believe 
he uses a USB key to transfer files in/out at the moment).  I would 
imagine the Fedora Core image by Noah might work there as well.

HTH, and let us know what your final solution is, if possible,
Mike
