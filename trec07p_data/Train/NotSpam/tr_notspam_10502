Changes and additions:

   SR-12 (05/11/07): Hail damage repairs virtually complete; Atlantis, exte=
rnal tank cleared for rollout
   SR-13 (05/14/07): Rollout moved up one day to 5/15
   SR-14 (05/15/07): Shuttle rollout begins

07:30 a.m., 05/15/07, Update: Shuttle Atlantis returns to launch pad=20

Catching a break from the weather, engineers began hauling the shuttle Atla=
ntis to pad 39A early today for work to ready the ship for blastoff June 8 =
on a long-delayed space station assembly mission.

Bolted to a mobile launch platform carried by a powerful crawler-transporte=
r, Atlantis began the 3.2-mile trip at 5:02 a.m. If all goes well, the shut=
tle's MLP will be "hard down" atop pad 39A around noon. Despite initial for=
ecasts calling for possible thunderstorms today, NASA officials said good w=
eather was expected all morning.

Atlantis originally was scheduled for launch March 15, but insulation near =
the top of the ship's external fuel tank was damaged during a freak hail st=
orm Feb. 26. The tank has now been repaired, with the lighter color foam in=
sulation used to fill in thousands of pits and gouges clearly visible in NA=
SA television shots today.

Rollout had been planned for Wednesday, but engineers completed preparation=
s in time to move the trip up one day. NASA now has four days of contingenc=
y time left in the schedule to handle unexpected problems.
