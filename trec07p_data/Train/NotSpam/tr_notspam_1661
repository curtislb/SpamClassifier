I am not familiar with module installations, let me ask a bit more to  
understand those limitations.

Wouldn't the problem with file name collisions/rewrites potentially  
happen if packages were managed as in distros? Or do they have some  
sort of policy about unicity of files in packages? Besides that, if  
CPAN.pm cached the MANIFESTs of modules installed by it (which if it  
doesn't, I guess it would be a matter of programming), wouldn't that  
suffice to offer uninstalling?
