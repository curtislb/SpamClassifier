Kate's house is beautiful! It's much nicer than the one
in Berkshire. Too bad people have to actually go there 
and try to see her homes in person.

We haven't owned a car (by choice) for 17 years and take 
public transportation everywhere. We're lucky enough to
live in a city where busses, trains and cabs are plentiful. 
Living just about anywhere else, we'd have to buy a 
stupid car. We also have no children though I have a 
son from a previous marriage who is married and has 
one child. We do try to recycle, especially newspapers.
I reuse plastic grocery bags as garbage pail liners.
We have Central Air Conditioning but try to use fans in
the windows on all but the hottest days. We live in an
apartment, not a house (again by choice). 

I figure we're doing our bit.
