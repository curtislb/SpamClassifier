Okay, I understand that on May 23, or something like that, Hynek Hanky released another CVS version of Speech-Dispatcher, that apparently resolves these bugs of it crashing so frequently.
Hynek,
If this helps:
I have not yet had time to test it.
I am on Windows XP at the moment.
Best thing I can do is to emulate an SMP (dual-core) Linux machine under VMWare workstation (sinse I can get Speech working just fine.) And then see if you're Speech-Dispatcher tests work out that way.
Lerenzo, have you tested these out yet?
I really really hope the day comes soon where Hynek can at least announce with pleasure that these weird crash bugs are finally resolved. 
When do you think another version of SpeechD-up for Speakup will be released? 0.4 is so old. Wonder if the CVS stuff is really any better despite being development code? I will happily test it, eaven if it breaks my Virtual systems ;).
Regards, --Keith.
