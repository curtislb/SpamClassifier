TONIGHT ON THE CBS  <http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/eveningnews/main3420.s=
html> EVENING NEWS

Here is an early preview of what we are planning for tonight's CBS EVENING =
NEWS from Anchor and Managing Editor, Katie Couric...=20

Hi everyone,=20

A prescription drug that's been taken by more than 6 million people has bee=
n linked to a significantly higher risk of heart attack - and even death. W=
yatt Andrews will report on Avandia, and our medical correspondent Dr. Jon =
LaPook will explain what this news means to families who deal with type 2 d=
iabetes.=20
In other medical news, a new pill is promising birth control with a boost. =
It could be relief for women from the pains and inconveniences of their men=
strual cycles. It is due to debut tomorrow but, as Michelle Miller will rep=
ort, its long-term safety isn't clear.=20

Gas prices have broken the record for high prices set during the energy cri=
sis of the early 1980s - when they are adjusted for inflation - until now. =
Anthony Mason will report on how tight refinery capacity is the latest caus=
e of high prices at the pump, and Byron Pitts will have the story of how ga=
soline costs are affecting consumers.=20

Tension in the Middle East can be another factor in high gas prices and ove=
r the past two days violent urban warfare has erupted in Lebanon. Intense f=
ighting between Lebanese troops and Islamic militants suspected of having t=
ies to al Qaeda has killed dozens of people. Mark Phillips will have the st=
ory.=20

Some great citizens of the country are being lauded for their valor in the =
wake of Hurricane Katrina. Today one relatively unknown name is being added=
 to the list of John F. Kennedy "Profile in Courage Award" recipients, whic=
h includes the likes of Kofi Annan and Gerald Ford. Her name is Doris Voiti=
er. Haven't heard of her? Correspondent Kelly Cobiella will introduce you t=
o this special woman tonight.=20

I hope you'll join us.=20

Katie=20
