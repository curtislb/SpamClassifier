It has come to my attention that the real name for "duct tape" is "Duck
Tape", because it was invented for boating applications.  "Duck Tape"
is, however, a brand name, though, so competing brands call it "duct
tape".  And we all know the strong relationship between Duck Tape and
gaffa tape.  With this information in mind, what light can we add to the
Gaffa debate?  Is Kate saying that she's suspended in duck poop?  Or
maybe it was a foreshadowing of The Ninth Wave?  Perhaps her boat sinks
due to an unintentional Duck Tape malfunction?

P.S. And to those who still claim that "gaffa tape" is not synonymous
with "gaffer's tape", please Google "gaffa tape" to have your profound
misconception corrected.
