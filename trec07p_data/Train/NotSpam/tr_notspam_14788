-'Samba4 TP4' presents you with an opportunity to see a Technology
-Preview (TP) snapshot of Samba4's development, as at January 2007.
+'Samba4 TP5' presents you with a snapshot into Samba4's ongoing
+development, as we move towards our first alpha releases.  This Technology
+Preview (TP) is snapshot of Samba4's development, as at June 2007.
 
-In the last few months since TP3 was released in October 2006,
-significant work has been done across many parts of Samba4.  Since that
-time, we have added the basis for some new and exciting features:
+In the time since TP4 was released in January 2007, Samba has
+continued to evolve, but you may particularly notice these areas:
 
-  PKINIT support to Samba4's KDC will allow, smart-card login to a
-  Samba4 domain.  TP4 demonstrates this with static key files, but
-  work will continue to enable actual hardware cards.
+  Work has continued on SWAT, the the libnet API behind it.  These we
+  hope will grow into a full web-based management solution for both
+  local and remote Samba and windows servers.
 
-  Clustering support was always a design goal of Samba4, and with TP4
-  we have the ctdb framework, a cluster-aware shared database.  This
-  allows Samba4 to share a shared cluster file-system with it's clients. 
-  Presented at this year's linux.conf.au, including a highly rigged
-  demo, you can expect to see this mature over the next few months.
+  The DRAUAPI research effort has largely concluded, and an initial
+  implementation of AD replication is present, included in torture
+  test-cases.  This includes the decryption of the AD passwords, which
+  were specially and separately encrypted.  This should be recognised
+  as vital milestone.
 
-  Non-blocking and Asynchronous IO support, has always been a design
-  goal in Samba4, and TP4 will use new Linux Kernel features to
-  implement event driven asynchronous IO.  This makes Samba more
-  efficient on systems where some data may be 'further away' than a
-  local disk, such as HSM systems.  This allows the Kernel to handle
-  reading the returned data from the disk, only notifying Samba when
-  the data is ready for dispatch to the client. 
+  Likewise, the LDAP Backend project has moved from a research
+  implementation into something that can be easily deployed outside
+  the test infrastructure.  
 
-  Our web-management console, known as SWAT, is being revamped, and in
-  TP4 you can find a new Web 2.0 style user interface, being used to
-  support a web-based ldb browser.  We hope this new system will allow
-  things simple not possible with the form-submit style of web
-  management.
+  Testing has been an area of great work, with renewed vigour to
+  increase our test coverage over the past few months.  In doing so,
+  we now demonstrate PKINIT and many other aspects of kerberos, as
+  well as command-line authentication handling in our testsuite.
 
-  Using LDB LDAP back-end integration has improved in this release, with an
-  improved mapping module allowing the start of Fedora DS back-end
-  support.  
+  The testsuite infrastructure has been rewritten in perl and
+  extended, to setup multiple environments: allowing testing of the
+  domain member, as well as the domain controller, roles.  Samba4's
+  initial implementation of winbind has been revived, to fill in these
+  tests.
 
-In continuing our research effort, TP4 includes the work to better
-understand and implement the DRSUAPI replication protocols.  By better
-understanding the needs of replication now, we can structure our
-databases so that their format will have to change less in future.
+  In clustering, work on CTDB (an implementation of a clustered Samba)
+  has moved ahead very well, but the current code has not
+  been merged into Samba4 in time for this release.
 
-We hope to use this replication function to replace the SamSync based
-Vampire process so effectively demonstrated since TP1, and to
-eventually join an Active Directory domain, as a replicating partner.
+  To support better management, we have investigated group policy
+  support, and include the infrastructure required.  Unfortunately
+  without MMC write support, you will need to place the polices into
+  the directory by hand.  
 
-Behind the scenes, much of the core infrastructure of Samba4 continues
-development:
+As we move forward, we have many of the features we feel are required
+for a Samba4 Alpha.  Similarly, we know enough about the data
+formats (particularly those that are encrypted) to be confident that
+we won't need to change the LDB format.  Our plan is to publish a
+Samba4 alpha in the next few months. 
 
-  In Kerberos, we have continued to track the development of the
-  Heimdal Kerberos implementation, and reduce the custom diff between
-  our branch and upstream.  Heimdal now provides plug-in APIs for
-  almost all of the hooks we need, including management and validation
-  of the PAC.
-
-  In testing, our test infrastructure has undergone a quiet
-  revolution, as we improve our unit test framework.  Likewise, the
-  tests themselves have continued to expand, as we follow our
-  test-driven development pattern.
-
-  In providing an abstraction above our raw RPC layer, the libnet
-  library continues to expand, becoming a C and JS management API for
-  Samba4 and remote servers.
-
-  To ensure that, as an administrator and developer, you can easily
-  read and edit our internal databases, our LDB layer has been
-  optimised for speed.  The aim here is to avoid needing to use the faster, but
-  more opaque, TDB layer.  
-
 These are just some of the highlights of the work done in the past few
 months.  More details can be found in our SVN history.
