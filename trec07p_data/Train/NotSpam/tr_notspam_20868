Robert,

I'm not exactly an expert, but here's what I think. If you have only
786 MB of RAM on your machine and you are using ~500 of it in a
session of R, that could slow things down considerably because your
machine is trying to find free blocks of memory that haven't been used
yet. I would buy additional RAM.

As for Mike Prager's point about the type of hard drive being
important, I'm not sure this is right (someone correct me if I'm
misunderstanding). R stores and accesses objects through RAM - they
aren't stored and accessed on the hard drive except when reading and
writing. So hard drive type probably won't make much difference to
speed in R.
