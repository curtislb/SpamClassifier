If the IDs appear in @id_hits in the same order as in $AFILE then
you can just go and fetch the nex id to look for like this:

  ID:
  foreach my $prime_id ( @id_hits ) {
    while ( my $line = <$AFILE> ) {
      if ( $line =~ /$prime_id/ ) {
        print "$line\n";
        next ID;
      }
    }
  }

but if they appear in the file in a different sequence then you also
need to rewind and start looking at the beginning of the file once
again like this:

  ID:
  foreach my $prime_id ( @id_hits ) {
    while ( my $line = <$AFILE> ) {
      if ( $line =~ /$prime_id/ ) {
        print "$line\n";
        seek $AFILE, 0, 0;
        next ID;
      }
    }
  }

Hope this helps.

Rob
