     It is WORKING!  Five years of boredom, apathy, and abject 
depression...GONE!  I'm back in Linux!  Kirk and Andy, I could kiss you, 
or at least shake your hand.  Thank you, thank you, thank you! 
Slackware is up and running.  Took 13 hours to puzzle everything out. 
Same excuse.  I should pay attention to the directions.  I love every 
single sightless one of you.  Thanks, guys.
