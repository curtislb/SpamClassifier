Just to back up a few previous posts ...

There is something like this facility already available via the
grid.xspline() function in the grid package.  This provides very
flexible curve drawing (including curves very close to Bezier curves)
based on the X-Splines implemented in xfig.  The grid.curve() function
provides a convenience layer that allows for at least certain
parameterisations of arcs (you specify the arc end points and the angle).

These functions are built on functionality within the core graphics
engine, so exposing a similar interface (e.g., an xspline() function)
within "traditional" graphics would be relatively straightforward.

The core functionality draws the curves as line segments (but
automatically figures out how many segments to use so that the curve
looks smooth);  it does NOT call curve-drawing primitives in the
graphics device (like PostScript's curveto).

In summary:  there is some support for smooth curves, but we could still
benefit from a specific arc() function with the standard
centre-radius-angle parameterisation and we could also benefit from
exposing the native strengths of different graphics devices (rather than
the current lowest-common-denominator approach).
