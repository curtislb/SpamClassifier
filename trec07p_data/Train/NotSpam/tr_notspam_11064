<b>Prince Harry NOT to serve in Iraq </b>
<br>

<br>
Is this a victory for Al Qaeda and its threats? What kind of message does t=
his send to our troops - spilling their blood is fine but not blue blood.=

<br>
This week we've been focusing on Iraq. Here are the details if you missed <=

<br>
<b>Grammar Schools </b>
<br>

<br>
This is shaping up to be the first really serious internal policy row for D=
avid Cameron with his own party.=20
<br>

<br>
It appears to be a conflict between the cherished Tory belief in meritocrac=
y (in favour of bright children going to grammar schools) and the contrary =
view from Shadow Education Secretary David Willetts that "academic selectio=
n entrenches advantage, it does not spread it."=20
<br>

<br>
<b>The Coronation </b>
<br>

<br>
At the time of writing it could be that Zombie Brown will not face any chal=
lenger for the Labour leadership.=20
<br>

<br>
We'll assess the impact of the coronation - if that's what it is - and have=
 the result of a special Newsnight poll at the hustings for the race to be =
deputy leader.=20
