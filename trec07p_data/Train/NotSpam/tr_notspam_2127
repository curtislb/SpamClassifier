Err, if I read the original message by Nathanael correctly, [Z] is
intended to be the "meaning" of the trademark.
E.g.: in his second example, the wording becomes "representing
endorsement by the Debian Project", where "endorsement by the Debian
Project" is supposed to be [Z], I would say...

I'll try to drop the "if applicable" words and see whether it makes more
sense, in light of the above clarification (again, assuming that I
understood Nathanael intentions correctly!).

Great, I like this!

Exactly what I was looking for.



OK, here we go (again and again!):



| The sign [X] (hereafter "the Mark") is a trademark, rights to which
| are held by [Y] (hereafter "the Mark Holder"), representing [Z].
|
| The Mark Holder hereby licenses you to use the Mark, or a modified
| version thereof, in any way and for any purpose, with the exception of
| the following:
|
| You are not authorized to use the Mark, or a modified version thereof,
| in commerce in any way that is likely to cause confusion, or to cause
| mistake, or to deceive
|
| (1) as to the affiliation, connection, or association of you or your
| product, service or other commercial activity with the Mark Holder, or
|
| (2) as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of your product,
| service or other commercial activity by the Mark Holder
|
| If the Mark qualifies as an original work of authorship under
| copyright law, then the Mark Holder separately grants you a
| copyright license, but that is not a trademark license and should
| not be construed as one.
