Well then, this may be leading in an obvious direction...

I think my mention of Firefox may have just been a subconscious threat 
;) -- the advantage of it is more in things like a clear extension 
mechanism, and we need to extend the browser in *some* way.

Even if PyXPCOM isn't terribly well documented and hard to build, that 
doesn't seem like a blocker in itself.  At least in theory, we just have 
to get it to build once or twice (or however many build systems there 
are -- I guess there's two).  Actually having extension in Python will 
make it a lot more accessible to many of the people who would actually 
like to work on it now, since they are pretty much all familiar with 
Python.

But despite the fact that this seems like a good direction, it hasn't 
happened yet because the setup is rather complex (as mentioned by you 
and several other people).  Probably just reaching the level of Hello 
World with PyXPCOM in the OLPC environment would be the biggest hurdle 
(or at least from there there would be much more satisfying work to be 
done).  Could you help get us to that point?

   Ian
