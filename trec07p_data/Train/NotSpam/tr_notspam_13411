						Tonight on Newsnight we have a report about the wholesale misuse of a=
 database of personal details, but we want to hear about what has happened =
to you.
<br>

<br>
Have you been a victim of identity theft?
<br>

<br>
Do you think those who hold your details do enough to stop this kind of the=
ft happening? And what experience of the police have you had if you've repo=
rted an identity theft?
<br>

<br>
Join the debate below.
