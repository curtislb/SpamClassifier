License texts which are being distributed in their capacity as a
license under which a work in Debian is distributed cannot be modified
necessarily. I don't believe anyone is seriously arguing differently,
save as a method of defending non-modifiability elsewhere.

This was raised in 2004 on this list (and presumably earlier as
well.)[1]

I don't believe we need an amendment to the Social Contract to
specifically state this as the case, but a correctly worded one which
specifically amended the social contract and/or the DFSG appropriately
may be worth some thought.

Unfortunatly, the currently proposed amendment does not disambiguate
between license texts in their capacity as a license under which a
work is distribute and random text which is labelled as a license.
