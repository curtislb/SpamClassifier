Lou Dobbs Tonight
Thursday, April 19, 2007

Tonight, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales in trouble – the
embattled head of the Justice Department testified on Capitol
Hill today, and some White House insiders are saying he went
down in flames. Will President Bush stand by his man? We’ll
find out tonight.

As we continue to follow the senseless murders in Blacksburg
this week, we’ll report on the communications failure between
officials at Virginia Tech, school security and local law
enforcement that helps explain how Cho Seung Hui slaughtered 32
students and teachers.

In an effort to combat the ongoing violence and killings
sweeping through Mexico, Mexican soldiers and police arrested
more than 100 police connected to Mexican drug gangs. The
police were arrested in a town where the bodies of executed
victims began littering the streets last year. Meanwhile, a
journalist was kidnapped at gunpoint in front of a police
station in Agua Prieta, Mexico and is feared dead. We’ll have a
report on the escalating violence tonight.

The wife of an imprisoned Chinese dissident has filed suit
against Yahoo!, claiming the company voluntarily handed over
information to the Communist Chinese government that led to her
husband’s arrest and subsequent torture. China continues to
crackdown with more controls over internet use. What’s behind
the Great Firewall? We’ll bring you that story tonight.

And Oklahoma is another step closer to passing one of the
toughest immigration laws in the country. The bill would make
it a crime to harbor, conceal or transport illegal aliens in
the state. We'll talk with the bill's author, Oklahoma State
Rep. Randy Terrill, who calls the bill “veto-proof.”

Visit http://cnn.com/loudobbstonight to read Lou’s
latest commentary on why we must reject death and violence as a
rite of passage on our college campuses, and for more
information on tonight’s show.

Lou Dobbs lays out his manifesto to save the middle class in
his new book, “War on the Middle Class: How the Government, Big
Business, and Special Interest Groups Are Waging War on the
American Dream and How to Fight Back.” War on the Middle Class
is now on sale in bookstores near you and on Amazon.com and
BarnesandNoble.com.
