There's a similar thing, except without the usage restrictions: their
"Consolas" font.  And while the other Vista fonts are only so-so even
compared to ttf-dejavu, I have to admit that Consolas is an awesome terminal
font.  A whole deal better than DejaVu Mono Sans.  And in an ironic turn,
while on M$ it _needs_ ClearType (and thus LCD) to be usable, with FreeType
it's very good even on CRT.

There is a string attached, though -- but one of a different kind.  You need
to be a "licensed user of Microsoft Visual Studio 2005".  It does have a
gratis edition, but that's a 35MB download just to satisfy the license.

Yeah, viewing MS Office files is a tiny portion of what we do, so the
usability of that package would be really limited.  On the other hand,
coding using a monospaced font...
