That's always been the case.  In fact MPI is a standard, where as PVM alway=
s=20
was an implementation defining a so-called standard.

You are!   I've never been patient enough to use plain Rmpi or rpvm except =

few times, but for me, the advantage of snow is that you get all the=20
backends, not just MPI.  In fact, I've heard mention that some folks are=20
sticking together a NWS backend as well.

In fact it might be easier, since we never put together decent aggregation=

routines.

(smarter doesn't mean works harder, just more intelligently :-).

=46ault tolerance is one of those very ill-defined words.   Specifically:

#1 - mapping pRNG streams to work units, not just CPUs or dispatch order (b=
oth=20
of which can differ), for reproducibility

#2 - handling "failure to complete" on worker nodes gracefully.

However, you'd need checkpointing or probably a miracle to handle failure o=
n=20
the master...
