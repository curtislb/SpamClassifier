Hello sm1lies,

We've got a new Design contest open today -- the .NET Fax Manager Version 1.0 -- with $1,200 in total prizes.

The Fax Manager Version 1.0 component will provide a Facade to the MS Fax Server component. It will accept the basic cover sheet information and a PDF and then send the fax using the MS Fax Server. The technologies involved include .NET 2.0 and Windows Server 2003.
