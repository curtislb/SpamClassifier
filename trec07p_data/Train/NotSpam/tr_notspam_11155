  There was debate today on Bill C-47 (An Act respecting the protection
of marks related to the Olympic Games and the Paralympic Games and
protection against certain misleading business associations and making a
related amendment to the Trade-marks Act).

http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HouseBills/BillsGovernment.aspx?Language=E&Mode=1&Parl=39&Ses=1#C47


  Charlie Angus gave a great speech talking about the problems with this
bill, the need for balance, the potential chilling effects and
unintended consequences, as well as the precedent of the reverse-onus
that he saw as mirroring some of the rhetoric from the infamous Bulte
report.


  As a question to a later speaker (not Charlie, as he would have given
a great response) a Bloc MP asked a Liberal MP about why it is that this
bill is moving so quickly, but that the Conservative Government isn't
doing anything to deal with counterfeiting -- specifically mentioning
movies in theaters.

  I don't remember the name of the member, but her name will be within
the Hansard that will be available tomorrow.



  Chris Brand sent a letter to Maka Kotto who asked a question in
Question Period about the 1996 WIPO treaties
http://www.digital-copyright.ca/node/3948  and the answer (paraphrasing)
was that they didn't want to Americanize the industry, but wanted to
discover what the government was going to say that seemed to take
positions in favor of the US.

  Ironic given the Bloc seems to be spend all their time complaining
that the Conservatives aren't Americanizing Canadian law fast enough.
They claim to want to protect sovereignty, but I see little evidence of
this on technology law.

  Are there any people in Quebec that want to approach the Bloc on this?
 We see some pretty good things being said by Charlie Angus of the NDP,
and we see so many very bad things being said by the Bloc, even though
historically both these parties had an interest in protecting Canadian
creativity.


  It should be noted that the Appropriation Arts folks received an
identical reply to a related question that Chris did.  This is an
improvement, given I've never even received a reform letter from a Bloc
MP as an anglophone Ontarian.
