Without replying to anyone in particular, I'll say ...

I agree with the camp that says an = at the start of a line is pod, 
without exception, regardless of context.

I am also assuming that "start of the line" means there is no 
whitespace to the left of the =.

I also recognize and agree with Perl 6 being sometimes whitespace sensitive.

I also found from my own experience a few months back (and I added a 
test for it as t/syntax/parsing/pod_in_multi_line_exprs.t), that this 
(represented with Pod 5) didn't work, but ought to (assume the 'my' 
et al is flush left):

   my $list = {

   =pod foo docs
   =cut

     'foo' => sub {...},

   =pod bar docs
   =cut

     'bar' => sub {...},

   };

For technical reasons, I was constructing a bunch of routines 
anonymized within a hash, rather than added to a package.  A whole 
file could be mostly a single hash declaration like this.  I had been 
expecting that I could put pod at the start of any line and it would 
work, as is what seems the most intuitive.  The camp that I support 
would make this work.

Given this, there is an obvious (to me) solution for pod blocks in 
the middle of expressions like:

   my $foo
     = $bar;

As the example shows, and I believe best practices espouse, you 
*indent* the code line with a leading =.

This both makes the Perl code easier to understand (a continuation is 
indented), and because there is leading whitespace, that = isn't 
confused with pod, which is always not indented.

Simple.

And since Perl 6 does consider whitespace significant sometimes, this 
is not unprecedented.
