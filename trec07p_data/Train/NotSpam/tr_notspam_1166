Glad to hear you got it working Beth!  Just out of curiosity, shouldn't the 
particianing software for your linux system have found your Windows partician 
and created a new partician for linux?  I'm curious because I, one day, want to 
have a duel-boot system and thought from the docs I read that you could just 
have the linux particianer resize the particians for you so Bill and the penguin 
could live happily?
