17 April 2007

Berlin (dpa) - Berlin's Museum of Egyptology rebuffed a threat from Egypt's
top antiquities official to block all art loans to Germany unless the
"world's most beautiful woman," Queen Nefertiti, goes home to Cairo. 

Though one eye is missing, the 3,000-year-old painted limestone bust of the
queen is celebrated as one of the finest female representations ever
created. It was taken to Germany from Egypt under a 1913 contract. 

Dietrich Wildung, the museum director, said on the radio channel Deutschland
radio Kultur he was not too concerned at the threat, since Egypt had not
lent any art to Germany since 1985 anyway. 

"Even without loans we can manage comfortably and put on a good show," he
said. 

Zahi Hawwas, head of Egypt's antiquities authority, told the parliament in
Cairo on Sunday that if Germany refused to lend the bust to Cairo, he would
halt further cooperation with German museums and archaeologists. 

Wildung said Nefertiti would not look so special in Cairo among all the
other treasures on display. 

Anja Kuhr, a spokesman for Culture Cooperation, a German group campaigning
for the bust to be lent to Egypt, meanwhile attacked the claim by the museum
that the bust is too fragile to be transported. 

Germany's state minister for culture, Bernd Neumann, had said Friday a loan
would be "irresponsible." 

Kuhr called for Neumann to obtain an expert report on Nefertiti's
robustness. She said the museum would be in trouble if the bust had decayed.


German art lover James Simon bought the bust from Ottoman authorities in
1913 and it is a top tourist attraction in Berlin. 

Nefertiti was the wife of the Egyptian Pharaoh Amenhotep IV and
mother-in-law of the Pharaoh Tutankhamun. Her name roughly translates to
"the beautiful one is come."

Pronto volver?n a la Argentina dos toneladas de f?siles (in La Nacion, 26
April 2007)
Elisabetta Piqu? Corresponsal en Roma 

26 avril 2007


ROMA.- Dos toneladas de f?siles que se hab?an sacado ilegalmente de las
provincias de Santa Cruz, Neuqu?n y Chubut, e incautados en Arizona, Estados
Unidos, donde se hace una feria anual de bienes paleontol?gicos, volver?n en
breve a la Argentina. 

"Normalmente damos malas noticias, pero ahora estamos recuperando", dijo a
LA NACION Am?rico Castilla, director nacional de Patrimonio y Museos de la
Secretar?a de Cultura, que anunci? la buena nueva en la ciudad eterna. 

Castilla viaj? hasta aqu? junto a la embajadora Mar?a Susana Pataro,
funcionaria de Parques Nacionales y asesora de la Direcci?n Nacional de
Areas Protegidas, para participar en un seminario organizado por el Centro
Internacional para la Conservaci?n y Restauraci?n de Bienes Culturales
(Iccrom), organismo mundial de la cultura creado por la Unesco, y el
Instituto Italo Latinoamericano (IILA). 

En este encuentro de expertos latinoamericanos en el que por primera vez se
defini? un programa de largo plazo sobre la conservaci?n del patrimonio
cultural en Am?rica latina, se habl? de varios temas, entre ellos el tr?fico
il?cito de bienes culturales. 


Al respecto, Castilla ilustr? la campa?a de prevenci?n que se est? haciendo
en la Argentina, que apunta a que la gente aprenda "que no tiene que irse
del lugar que ha visitado con un pedazo de cer?mica prehisp?nica de
recuerdo. En Am?rica latina es recurrente el tr?fico il?cito de bienes
culturales, sobre todo en pa?ses como Per? y Bolivia, que han sido
expoliados". 

Se trata de pi?as f?siles, restos ?seos de dinosaurios y de aves, que al
parecer intentaron venderse en una feria anual que suele hacerse en Arizona.
Gracias a que un cient?fico argentino que reside en los Estados Unidos
detect? estas valios?simas piezas, la Argentina -despu?s de Mongolia el pa?s
con la mayor riqueza paleontol?gica del mundo- present? un recurso, y ahora
se espera que concluyan los tr?mites con Interpol para que los f?siles sean
devueltos. 

Castilla, que es adem?s director del Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, tiene
experiencia en este tema. El a?o ?ltimo, de hecho, fue ?l quien viaj? a
Par?s para buscar tres cuadros impresionistas (de Gauguin, Cezanne y Renoir)
que hab?an sido robados de ese museo en 1980. 

Al margen del tema del tr?fico il?cito de bienes culturales, en el
seminario-taller que tuvo lugar en el cuartel general del Iccrom, en el
barrio de Trastevere, se habl? tambi?n de la importancia de la educaci?n
para que haya una mejor conservaci?n natural y cultural del patrimonio y de
"turismo responsable". 

"En un pa?s como la Argentina, donde ahora, debido a la paridad cambiaria,
el turismo ha adquirido una importancia muy grande, incluso el cultural, se
hace m?s que necesaria la conservaci?n del sitio -dijo Pataro-. Si bien los
turistas traen recursos, que pueden ser una fuente importante de
financiaci?n para la conservaci?n del patrimonio, tambi?n pisotean, tiran
basura y pueden robarse piezas de valor." 

El deterioro que en su momento tuvo la famosa Cueva de las Manos, en Santa
Cruz, por ejemplo, "no se debe a la lluvia ni a los animales, sino a la
gente, que dibuj? graffitis en ese alero pictogr?fico", denunciaron Pataro y
Castilla, que coincidieron en que para prevenir este tipo de cosas es
fundamental que haya una estrategia de manejo, planificaci?n y gesti?n
integrada del sitio. 

"La educaci?n es fundamental, porque lo que no se conoce no se quiere y no
se cuida", sintetiz? Pataro, que adelant? que como en esa zona de la
Patagonia hay muchos m?s aleros ahora se est? pensando en ampliar el sitio,
para que tambi?n sea "m?s comprensible para el visitante". 

Con ese mismo motivo, el pr?ximo 19 de mayo, que es el D?a Internacional de
los Museos, se inaugurar? un nuevo Centro de Interpretaci?n de las Misiones
Jesu?ticas de San Ignacio, sitio que tambi?n fue declarado hace a?os
patrimonio mundial de la humanidad por la Unesco.

Venus finally makes her way home 

    April 24 2007 at 02:25PM  
 
Rome - Italy will return to Libya an ancient Roman statue taken from the
former North African colony - a move Rome hopes will help its own campaign
to retrieve allegedly looted antiquities from museums worldwide.

The statue of the goddess Venus was brought to Italy after it was found in
1913 by Italian troops near the ruins of the Greek and Roman settlement of
Cyrene, on the Libyan coast, the Culture Ministry said on Tuesday.

A date for the 2nd-century statue's return has yet to be set, ministry
officials said. The statue is now housed in Rome's National Roman Museum.

The headless marble figure of the goddess of love is a copy of a Greek
statue that has never been found, said Silvana Rizzo, an archaeologist at
the ministry.

"When we talk about Roman copies of Hellenistic statues we are talking about
very important works, because most of the time they are the only traces of
the original works that were later destroyed," she said.

Libyan authorities requested the statue in 1989, but the process was slowed
down by a protracted judicial battle initiated by a group that considered
the work part of Italy's cultural heritage. 

Last week, an administrative court ruled in favour of returning the statue
to Tripoli, the ministry said in a statement.

The ruling constitutes "a useful precedent to promote the return, in favour
of Italy, of antiquities that were looted by other states," the statement
said.

Italy is aggressively campaigning to recover antiquities it says were
smuggled out of the country and sold to museums worldwide. 

It also has made some restitution to countries that had their own treasures
looted by Italians.

In 2005, Rome returned to Ethiopia the 1 700-year-old Axum obelisk taken in
1937 on the orders of fascist dictator Benito Mussolini.

New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art and Boston's Museum of Fine Arts have
agreed to return antiquities to Italy, but negotiations with the J. Paul
Getty Museum in Los Angeles have been stalled for months.

Italy has placed former Getty curator Marion True and art dealer Robert
Hecht on trial in Rome for allegedly knowingly receiving dozens of
archaeological treasures that were stolen from private collections or dug up
illicitly. The two Americans deny wrongdoing. - Sapa-AP

Pakistani museums plagued by theft

* 7 cases reporting 401 missing items registered since 1996

By Hina Farooq

LAHORE: Theft of artefacts from museums all over Pakistan has been a problem
for a very long time. Seven cases reporting 401 missing objects have been
registered since 1996. Of those, only 44 have been recovered so far. The
remaining pieces are still being found. 

Tibbi Police is still looking for ornaments of Ranjit Singh's horse, which
are missing since 1996 from the Armoury Gallery at Lahore Fort Museum.
Furthermore, 39 valuable tones were stolen in 1965 from the Archaeological
Museum in Taxila, along with 71 items from the Gandhara civilization in
1971. Out of these, only 11 stones have been recovered. Forty gold and
bronze coins, and 12 bronze statues were stolen from the National Museum of
Pakistan in Karachi in 1986, which have not been found. The Archaeological
Museum in Mohenjodaro reported 38 Indus seals and two tablets missing in
2002. 

Since 2004, 2,080 smuggled artifacts have been seized, of which 38 of the
Gandhara items were found in New Jersey, US in 2004. About 1400 pieces,
which consisted of Gandhara, Indus, pre-Indus and Islamic art, were seized
at the Karachi port in 2005. Other recoveries include six artefacts from
Lahore in 2006, now in the possession of the Customs; 619 artefacts from
Karachi airport also in 2006, currently held by the Culture Department, and
17 items from France, which are still held by the Frech government.

Thousands of Nazi-Looted Works Are Held by Museums, Survey Says 

By Catherine Hickley

April 27 (Bloomberg) -- Museums are hoarding thousands of artworks seized by
the Nazis and doing too little, especially in Germany, to trace the prewar
Jewish owners or their heirs, the authors of a new handbook on art
restitution say. 

During Hitler's 12-year rule, about 650,000 works were plundered in the
biggest art heist ever, the New York-based Jewish Claims Conference
estimates. Restitutions such as the city of Berlin's return last year of
Ernst Ludwig Kirchner's 1913 ``Berlin Street Scene'' are only a start, said
Gunnar Schnabel, who compiled ``Nazi Looted Art'' (Proprietas Verlag) with
historian Monika Tatzkow. The book will be published in English in June. 

``It's like hiding a nuclear bomb under the bedcovers,'' Schnabel said in an
interview in Berlin before an April 23-24 congress on looted art held in
nearby Potsdam. ``There are so many cases that need to be cleared up,
thousands of them in Germany alone.'' 

Before World War II, Jewish art lovers were behind some of Europe's greatest
private collections. The Nazis created a bureaucracy devoted to looting
them. Hitler appointed a commission to hunt down old masters for a planned
museum in his home town of Linz, while Hermann Goering scoured Europe to
expand the private collection he kept at his country estate near Berlin. The
Gestapo ransacked museums and homes for ``degenerate'' modern artworks. 

In the five years after the war, looted art was collected by the allies and
returned to their countries of origin. Yet until the collapse of communism
in 1989, little was done to find the rightful owners, says Christian
Kennedy, the Special Envoy for Holocaust Issues at the U.S. State
Department. 

``Sixty years later, we are still trying to put the pieces together,'' he
told delegates in Potsdam. 

`Fair Solution' 

For Germany, where the legal deadline for restitution claims was 1992, the
non-binding Washington Principles agreed by 44 countries in 1998 are the
framework for returning loot. The signatories agreed to identify stolen art,
open up archives, publicize suspicious cases, establish a central registry
of looted art and ``achieve a just and fair solution'' for the Nazi-
persecuted prewar owners or their heirs. 

While the Netherlands and Austria have almost completed their provenance
research of public collections, Germany isn't living up to its commitments,
said Georg Heuberger, head of the Jewish Claims Conference's Frankfurt
office. 

``The rupture in civilization that was the Holocaust can only be overcome
through restitution,'' Heuberger said in an interview during the Potsdam
conference. ``Instead of making special efforts, Germany is backpedaling.
That disturbs me.'' 

Big Business 

Culture Minister Bernd Neumann last year called a meeting of museum
directors that pledged to coordinate provenance research nationwide and make
restitution more transparent. The government is discussing funding of as
much as 5 million euros ($6.8 million) for museums to conduct research,
Neumann's spokesman Hagen-Philipp Wolf said in a telephone interview. 

Lawyers, art detectives, genealogists and auction houses are filling the gap
left by slow government action to help victims and heirs track down art.
With every side taking a cut and art prices at records, restitution has
become big business. 

The lack of a central help desk means victims and heirs ``are forced to go
to a lawyer or private researcher,'' Heuberger said. ``They then have to
promise them 30 percent or 50 percent of the auction price to even get
started. It's not a good situation for the heirs.'' 

Anita Halpin, the London-based heir of ``Berlin Street Scene,'' sold the
painting for a Kirchner record of $38.1 million at a Christie's
International auction in New York -- after talks with the Berlin Senate
collapsed on a purchase that would have kept the work in Berlin's own
Bruecke Museum. 

Cosmetics Mogul 

The buyer was cosmetics mogul Ronald S. Lauder's Neue Galerie on New York's
Fifth Avenue. The gallery also purchased a Gustav Klimt portrait of Adele
Bloch-Bauer, restituted by the Austrian government, for $135 million last
year. 

The Kirchner return unleashed what Neumann termed an ``emotional debate'' in
Germany. Bernd Schultz, head of Berlin auction house Villa Grisebach, wrote
in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung of ``unscrupulous, sharp restitution
lawyers in the U.S.'' seeking ``to break open all the German museums as a
boost for the international art market.'' 

Similar criticism surfaced in the Netherlands, where a court in February
ordered the heir of gallery owner Jacques Goudstikker to pay her lawyer 7.9
million euros ($10.7 million) for his help in recovering more than 200 works
from the Dutch state. 

Law Firms' Cut 

David Rowland of the New York law firm Rowland & Petroff, the lawyer who
secured the return of ``Berlin Street Scene,'' said that the real issue is
justice for the heirs. He declined to disclose the percentage his firm
charges. 

``These claims that the law firms are taking all the profit, it's certainly
not true in our case,'' he said in an interview in Potsdam. Though his firm
works on a contingency basis -- charges a percentage only if the claim is
successful -- ``it certainly doesn't approach the level of 50 percent,'' he
said. ``It varies according to the circumstances.'' 

A German panel set up to settle disputed cases has only ruled on two, and
the Kirchner painting is not one of them. The patrons' association of the
Bruecke Museum, where ``Berlin Street Scene'' was previously housed, says it
should have been, and blames the city government for the picture's loss. 

Ludwig von Pufendorf, head of the association and a restitution lawyer, has
filed a complaint against former Culture Senator Thomas Flierl and his
deputy, Barbara Kisseler, for breach of trust. Berlin prosecutors said this
week that they'll investigate it, after rejecting a previous request. 

Museums and Money 

``We have to find the money'' to do the provenance research, Martin Roth,
the director of Dresden's public museums, said in an interview in Potsdam.
He conceded that there may be ``hundreds'' of looted objects in Dresden's
collections. 

Another obstacle, Schnabel and Heuberger say, is that museums neglect to
publicize art that is suspected of being stolen for fear of losing important
works. 

The public database http://www.lostart.de , where museums should list art of
dubious provenance, mainly contains art lost through Soviet plundering after
the war. Only a handful of ``the suspicious cases'' are included, Schnabel
says. 

That contrasts with the U.S., where a portal set up by the American
Association of Museums has drawn 155 museums listing 25,424 artworks that
may have been looted by the Nazis.

Thieves Sentenced in Norway For Heist of Munch's 'Scream'

Associated Press
Tuesday, April 24, 2007; C05



OSLO, April 23 -- Three men who worked together to steal Edvard Munch's
masterpieces "The Scream" and "Madonna" were sentenced to prison on Monday
for their roles in the brazen daylight heist. Both paintings were recovered,
but were damaged.

One of the gunmen, the getaway driver and the mastermind of the 2004 theft
at Oslo's Munch Museum were convicted last month. The second suspected
gunman died in November before charges could be filed.

Two years after the theft, police recovered the paintings, which were
scraped and punctured, their paint dislodged. The museum is considering
using an eye surgeon to remove glass shards embedded in the canvas after the
frames were broken.

There are four versions of "The Scream," probably Munch's best-known work,
depicting a waiflike figure apparently screaming or hearing a scream. The
image has become an icon of modern human anxiety.

Petter Tharaldsen, 35, was sentenced to 9 1/2 years in prison for driving
the getaway car. His term also included a sentence for an unrelated robbery.

Bjoern Hoen, 39, convicted of masterminding the theft, was sentenced to nine
years. Tharaldsen and Hoen were also convicted of being part of an organized
crime group.

Stian Skjold, 31, was sentenced to 5 1/2 years as one of the two gunmen who
raided the museum. The three defendants were also ordered to pay a total of
$262,000 in compensation to the city of Oslo, which owns the paintings.

Nazi-looted art: German manual makes claims easier 

 

Original article: www.ejpress.org/article/16326 

By Emsie Ferreira Updated: 27/Apr/2007 15:39 
 
 
 
BERLIN (AFP)---In the wake of sensational sales of art that was seized by
the Nazis, German authors have published the first handbook to help Jewish
families win back masterpieces that are still in the wrong hands. 

The 528-page tome "Nazi Looted Art - Art Restitution Worldwide" is sold as a
do-it-yourself law manual for heirs of Holocaust victims hoping to confront
museums and collectors in different corners of the world in a bid to recover
lost canvasses. 

Co-author Gunnar Schnabel makes an educated guess that "there are still
thousands of masterpieces and tens of thousands of lesser paintings that
should be returned to the rightful heirs. 

"For example, some 30,000 art works were taken out of France, but 16,000
never resurfaced. It is the museums' policy to keep all of this top secret. 

There are works in basements and vaults," Schnabel, a lawyer who handles
restitution claims, told AFP. 

Even before it hit the shelves in March, the book he wrote with historian
Monika Tatzkow was adding to pressure on the German government to return a
painting from the Biedermeier era featured on its cover. 

The work, "Fiat Justitia" by Carl Spitzweg, formed part of the German
government's art collection for decades after World War II. 

But it originally belonged to Jewish trader Leo Bendel who died in the
Buchenwald concentration camp in 1940. 

In February, as articles about the book appeared in most Austrian and German
newspapers, the German finance ministry announced that it would return the
painting to the Bendel heirs. 

German museums 

Schnabel and Tatzkow say they hope to force museums to investigate the
provenance of their works and come clean on art they obtained thanks to the
Nazis' systematic seizure of Jewish collections which peaked in the early
1940s. 

German museums panicked last year when Berlin's Bruecke Museum had to part
with Ernst Ludwig Kirchner's "Berlin Street Scene," a prized Expressionist
painting looted from a Jewish shoemaker. 

When the claimant let Christie's auction the work and it was bought by US
cosmetics magnate Ronald Lauder for 38 million dollars (28 million euros),
curators began bracing for a flood of claims from heirs hoping for a
windfall from a buoyant art market. 

Lauder is famous for collecting restituted art and an obvious target for
criticism that a moral issue is being commercialised. 

His first piece was a Van Gogh drawing discovered by Tatzkow which he bought
for seven million euros, but in 2005 he paid a record 135 million dollars
for "Adele Block Bauer I," an iconic portrait by Secessionist -- the
Austrian name for Art Nouveau -- artist Gustav Klimt, after it was
restituted to the sitter's niece. 

"It's only about money and speculation," Martin Roth, the director of
Dresden's State Art Collection, complained recently. 

Museums like the Bruecke say they cannot afford to follow the example of
Vienna's Leopold Museum which invited scrutiny of the origins of its
unrivalled Egon Schiele collection. 

It has also spent millions contesting a claim for the Austrian artist's
"Portrait of Wally." 

Conference 

But ahead of an international conference on looted art taking place in
Potsdam near Berlin next week, historian Julius Schoeps said: "I think the
museums also lack the will." 

He advised museums to loan out works to raise funds to pay out claimants as
a way of keeping their collections intact. 

Schnabel thinks there "is not enough money to buy back all the paintings the
Nazis stole," but said in his experience museums are not prepared to pay
even modest reparations. 

"Initially, with the Kirchner painting, the granddaughter was happy to
accept a sum below the market price but the museum refused." 

Tatzkow accuses museums of playing for time in the knowledge that the
generation of Jews whose parents perished in the Holocaust will not be
around forever. 

"They are trying to sit the problem out, to wait for time to pass," she
said. 

"The story of a missing artwork will eventually get lost in a family. The
children will know something but once they are dead, restitution becomes
more difficult." 

Claims 

Their book discusses 109 claims, successful and otherwise, filed from France
to the United States to Australia, to illustrate the legal precedent in
different countries. 

It spares no reputations and hints that Jewish dealers joined in the
lucrative business of trading looted art after the war. 

"At that time it did not matter to them," Tatzkow said. 

She insists that despite the fortune to be made on the re-sale of some
restituted works, the art's main value for heirs remains sentimental. 

"A restituted painting gives a family back a part of the past. Sometimes a
work of art is all that survived the war and getting it back also helps to
tell the story of what happened to the owner." 

She disputes claims that the market value of looted paintings is enhanced by
their tragic history. 

"If a work was believed to have been lost for 50 years and it resurfaces, as
happened with a Schiele, this adds to its value. But it is simply the
prolonged absence from the market that pushes up prices." 

Schnabel said heirs trying to find their way through the maze of restitution
laws have said they found the book, which will be published in English in
June, useful. 

"A 78-year-old lady who is trying to reclaim an Impressionist masterpiece
said it gave her the confidence to stand her ground in meetings with people
who say they have the work." 

But it has not always been welcomed by fellow lawyers. 

"A number of my colleagues are not happy. They asked me why I give away
expertise that they sell for a very high price," Schnabel smiled.

British museum hands over Aboriginal remains
Email Print Normal font Large font Julia May, London
April 28, 2007

THE Tasmanian Aboriginal community is claiming a partial victory in its
20-year battle to bring home the remains of its ancestors, as Britain's
Natural History Museum has agreed to hand over four of the 17 remains it
holds.

But the Tasmanians have another fight ahead as they take on Britain's two
most famous universities and a second national museum for Aboriginal remains
they possess.

Two representatives from the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre, Greg Brown and
Caroline Spotswood, arrived in London yesterday to start mediation with the
Natural History Museum. They are trying to stop it from scientifically
testing the remains of 17 Aborigines it holds. Those remains are due to be
returned to Tasmania for burial.

On the eve of their departure, the museum agreed to hand over four remains
on which it has completed testing. The handover ceremony was due to take
place yesterday London time, at the museum in South Kensington.

In a statement Ms Spotswood said: "These remains, together with those of 13
more of our people, were removed without any Aboriginal consent from
Tasmania during the 1880s and we have been fighting since the 1980s for
their return. Greg and I are both proud and honoured to be able to take them
home to lay their tormented spirits to rest."

A spokeswoman said the museum was trying to stick to a previously agreed
deadline of March 31 for the return of all 17 remains. "We wanted to keep
our original promise," she said.

The Tasmanians will also attempt to reclaim remains held by Oxford and
Cambridge universities and National Museums Scotland.

"Here is an opportunity for them in goodwill to say, 'OK, because of what's
happening (with the Natural History Museum) . we would like to offer you the
remains while you're here,' " Mr Brown said.

He said the universities and the Scottish museum had not released any
details of testing. "We would be extremely disappointed if they are being
tested on," he said.

Last year two other representatives from the centre, Leah Brown and Adam
Thompson, met the three organisations to lobby for the remains.

Cambridge University holds four Aboriginal skulls and possibly two jawbones.
A spokesman said that it was still developing its policy on human remains.

Oxford University confirmed that the centre had requested the return of four
Aboriginal hair samples that it has tested for DNA. In the 2006 discussions,
the university suggested that it may not even deem hair to constitute human
remains.

Last year National Museums Scotland showed Ms Brown and Mr Thompson an
Aboriginal skull. It told The Age that repatriation requests were considered
on a case-by-case basis.

Mediation between the Tasmanians and the Natural History Museum will start
next Wednesday to bypass a costly hearing in the British High Court. The
Tasmanians are trying to stop further scientific tests. These include
drilling into bones and teeth to extract DNA and making plaster casts of
teeth and jaws.

"Testing is culturally offensive to us; we see that for us to lay our old
fellas and their spirits to rest, we need to bring them back intact without
this experimentation," Mr Brown said.

The case is so sensitive that each side has appointed a co-mediator to
ensure independence: the former NSW chief justice Sir Laurence Street, for
the Tasmanians, and a respected British legal reformer, Lord Harry Woolf,
for the museum.

Sir Laurence said he was confident the two parties could reach a conclusion.
"We'll work it out," he said.

I'm sure that Lord Woolf and I will have no trouble finding a rapport and
finding a way to move forward."

Met's art theft squad has to go cap in hand: Budget cut leads to vain quest
for private backers: Specialist unit accorded every low priority' 

The Guardian
21 April 2007

C Copyright 2007. The Guardian. All rights reserved. 

The dramatic scaling down of Scotland Yard's once renowned arts and antique
squad has left organised criminals free to plunder the nation's heritage,
according to a leading fi ne art insurer. 

Police have sought private money to finance the squad after its annual
budget of some pounds 300,000 was halved earlier this year. But the Guardian
has learned that Scotland Yard has failed to secure a penny from insurers or
auction houses, after months of discussions. 

Britain's art market is second only to the US and experts claim up to pounds
200m worth of stolen art and antiques are sold in the UK each year. INTERPOL
estimates that art theft is the fourth largest organised crime after drugs,
people trafficking and arms. 

Annabel Fell-Clark, chief executive of Axa Art UK, which pays out tens of
millions of pounds a year to reimburse vic- 

tims of art theft, condemned the slashing of the unit's budget. She warned
that scaling down the unit was already having an impact on pursuing art
thieves who target Britain's stately homes and museums. 

iWe have seen that they [the team] are increasingly overstretched and being
treated as a very low priority. At the moment we have very good information
which we are wanting to pass on, which would bring arrests, if not
convictions. But we are not being treated particularly seriously, let's put
it that way. 

iWe want to see criminal gangs brought to justice, and in some instances
lack of interest from the squad has stopped us being able to pursue further
recovery. We want and need to work with the police. 

She said Axa was aware the government was seeking funding for the squad but
the company had decided it would not con- sider paying directly for the
unit, adding that attempts by the Home Office and the Metropolitan Police to
find private sponsors in the art world were shortsighted. 

It would be a conflict of interest for us to get involved, she said. We have
slightly different agendas. As insurers, we are interested in recovering the
pieces however we can, and are not that bothered about finding and
prosecuting the perpe- trators. We are concerned that this aspect of law
enforcement is not taken particularly seriously right now. 

iVery often when you are investigating art theft connections are uncovered
with organised crime in relation to drugs and 

arms dealing, so it doesn't make sense to ignore this aspect of criminal
activity. 

The London based arts squad was formed in 1969 to pursue and prosecute
criminals who operate in the second biggest art market in the world. In the
past the unit, which is called in to investigate 120 cases a year, was
involved in recovery of art works across the world. 

According to art crime sources, officers from the squad worked with Spanish
investigators to help crack one of Europe's most spectacular art robberies -
the theft of 19 paintings valued at pounds 30m from the Madrid penthouse of
Esther Koplowitz, Marquesa of Casa Penalver and Cardenas. 

Other successes include the uncovering of a multimillion pound British
smuggling operation in which precious antiquities and archaeological
artefacts were stolen from Egypt, some of which were sold at 

Sotheby's. 

Last year the unit arrested a gang allegedly responsible for stealing tens
of millions of pounds of art and antiques from 

stately homes over four years, including pounds 30m worth of antiques from
Ramsbury Manor in Wiltshire. 

Mark Dodgson, of the British Antique Dealers Association, said: iThe idea of
Value of stolen art and antiques sold in 

the UK annually, according to expertspounds 200m people in the art world
funding the squad seems wrong. My members pay taxes already, and surely
paying for the police is what their taxes are for. 

Scotland Yard confirmed that as yet no private investors had been identified
to provide the 50% funding required for the unit by the next financial year.

EN UNA GALERIA DE BARRIO NORTE; Recuperan cuatro obras de arte robadas en
Mendoza 

Clar?n
23 April 2007

?Clar?n Contenidos 

Eran buscadas por INTERPOL. En conjunto est?n valuadas en 250.000 pesos. 

Las pinturas, valuadas en unos 250.000 pesos, hab?an sido robadas de un
museo de Mendoza. La Polic?a empez? a investigar y finalmente las hall? por
la denuncia del due?o de una galer?a: estaban en Barrio Norte, en plena
Capital Federal. Seg?n fuentes del caso, hasta anoche por el caso no hab?a
detenidos. 

La obras recuperadas son una acuarela sobre papel denominada "Botes", de
Jorge Larco, otra sobre papel llamada "Ma?ana en Venecia", de Aquiles Badi,
y dos ?leos sobre tela: "3Pensativa", de Horacio Bultler, y "Pasan... 1939",
de Raquel Forner (ver qui?nes son...). 

"Estas cuatro obras desaparecieron entre febrero y marzo de este a?o del
museo de Bellas Artes de San Rafael, Mendoza. Son las ?ltimas obras robadas
de una cadena de desapariciones, que en su inventario suman m?s de 30
cuadros en 15 a?os", explic? a Clar?n en aquella provincia el artista
pl?stico Luis Freire. 

A partir de la denuncia de la desaparici?n de las obras, el juez Gabriel
Oscar Ravagnani Navarrete, titular del Juzgado de Instrucci?n 3 de San
Rafael orden? a la Divisi?n INTERPOL de la Polic?a Federal que investigue. 

Seg?n Freire, la obra m?s costosa de las halladas es "Pasan... 1939", de
Forner. 

"INTERPOL empez? a buscar las obras pero sin ?xito. Finalmente la misma
galer?a de arte donde fueron halladas las pinturas robadas fue la advirti?
que el cuadro 'Pasan' aparec?a en un cat?logo como parte de la colecci?n del
museo de San Rafael. Entonces sus due?os decidieron realizar la denuncia
policial", cont? una fuente del caso. 

Fue as? que el s?bado a la tarde agentes de INTERPOL fueron a la galer?a de
Barrio Norte y secuestraron las obras.

Preliminary court proceeding on case of Aydin Ibrahimov, who is accused of
stealing art works from State Art Museum, was held at Azerbaijani Court of
Grave Crimes. 

Ogtay Gerekmezli, lawyer for Ibrahimov petitioned for commuting his arrest
to house arrest taking into consideration his disease and contributions for
the country. The court granted the petition. Ibrahimov was released.The next
legal proceeding was fixed to April 25. 

Ibrahimov faced charges on robbery and smuggling. 

274 art works were stolen from State Art Museum in 1993. As a result of
joint operations with national central bureaus of INTERPOL in Washington,
Wiesbaden and other, the stolen art works were found in the US. 

All persons involved in the crime were held accountable and INTERPOL issued
international notice on Aydin Ibrahimov. 

He left the US for Azerbaijan in September this year and gave in. APA
