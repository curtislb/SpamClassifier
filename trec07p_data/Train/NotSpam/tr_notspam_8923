HEADLINES:
V.P. CHENEY SENSES “GREATER SENSE OF URGENCY” AMONG IRAQIS
Today Vice President Dick Cheney said he believes there's a "greater sense of urgency" among Iraqis to generate progress on all fronts in the war-wracked nation.  Mister Cheney, in Iraq on an unannounced visit, appeared before reporters with U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker and General David Petraeus, the top-ranking U.S. military official in Iraq.  The vice president was asked about one contentious issue: parliament's plans to take a two-month summer recess amid a host of unresolved issues, including oil revenue legislation, de-Baathification and constitutional reform.  U.S. officials have said that hiatus would be unwise.  But he declined to reveal what he said to Iraqi officials on the matter. Instead the vice president referred to the issue in general terms, saying only that he couldn't predict whether parliament would recess, and it's important to take up any matter in a "timely fashion."  "Any undue delay would be difficult to explain and we hope they would approac!
 h these issues with all deliberate dispatch, if I can put it in those terms," Mister Cheney said, adding that he believes there is sympathy among Iraqi officials toward U.S. concerns.

The vice president, who met earlier with Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, said the prime minister is planning to address parliament this week on a number of issues.  And he said the situation on the ground has "gotten better" according to conversations he's had in Iraq, and he cited drops in sectarian violence statistics that have been "fairly dramatic."  "Everyone realizes there still are serious security issues, problems, threats," Mister Cheney said. "But the impression I got from talking with them, and this includes military, is they do believe we are making progress."  This Iraq stopover kicks off a scheduled week-long visit to the region, where Mister Cheney will hold talks with leaders in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan.

COALITION SOLDIER KILLED IN 16-HOUR-LONG FIGHT IN AFGHANISTAN
Today we learned that Afghan troops, "advised by U.S. Special Forces" fought a 16-hour battle yesterday with Taliban fighters in southern Afghanistan.  That’s according to the U.S.-led coalition.  A coalition soldier was killed, it said. There was no word on Taliban casualties and "no reported injuries to any Afghan civilians."  The coalition said the fighting began with small-arm, mortar, and rocket-propelled-grenade fire from militants in the volatile Sangin District Center in Helmand Province.  "The combined force returned fire at Taliban fighters near the village of Lwar Malazi, and then pursued retreating fighters. During the pursuit, the friendly force continued to receive enemy small-arms, RPG and mortar fire from the western side of the Helmand River," the coalition said in a news release.  More than 200 Taliban fighters "massed" on the Afghan and U.S. forces during the fighting, it said, and intelligence indicated that foreign fighters and Taliban militants from Her!
 at in the west were engaged in fighting.  "Coalition close air support aircraft destroyed three enemy command and control compounds, including an enemy underground tunnel network located along the upper Sangin River Valley," the coalition said.

UNWELCOME VISITOR COMES EARLY: FIRST NAMED STORM
The National Weather Service today named its first storm -- three weeks ahead of the official start of the Atlantic hurricane season.  Subtropical Storm Andrea, with sustained winds of 45 miles per hour and higher gusts, was centered 140 miles southeast of Savannah, Georgia, and was moving slowly toward the west at three miles per hour, forecasters said.  A tropical storm watch was issued for the southeastern coast from Altamaha Sound in Georgia to Flagler Beach in Florida, an NWS statement said.  "Since the heaviest rains associated with Andrea are expected to remain offshore during the next 24 hours…Andrea is not expected to produce significant rainfall over any land areas through at least Thursday morning," the statement said.  Hurricane season officially begins June 1.

BLAZE ON THE MOVE: LOS ANGELES WILDFIRE MOVES WEST
Residents forced to evacuate as a wildfire in the hills above Los Angeles moved close to their homes will begin returning home today after the blaze edged westward, away from their residences.  The fire has scorched more than 600 acres in historic Griffith Park, Los Angeles Fire Department officials said.  The flames forced residents in as many as 300 homes in the Los Feliz neighborhood on the south side of the park to evacuate yesterday.  A red flag warning was issued for the region today due to low humidity, temperatures close to 100 degrees and 20 mile per hour Santa Ana winds in one of the Los Angeles area's driest seasons in history.  But lower temperatures and calmer winds overnight allowed the 500 firefighters working the fire to bring the blaze to 40 percent containment, Los Angeles Fire Captain Brian Sandwick said.  The main concern for firefighters is that the flames currently on a steep hillside in the 4,200 acre park will move into the trees there and jump a road!
  to a heavy pine area, which could spread the fire to Interstate 5.

CALM BEFORE THE STORM: SENATORS READY FOR NEXT WEEK'S IMMIGRATION DEBATE
Senators are scheduled to begin debate on immigration legislation next week, but it is unclear if lawmakers will take up an old bill that stalled in last year's GOP-controlled Congress or construct a new measure.  Senators from both parties have been focusing on the issue in recent weeks and have formed "the outline of an immigration bill," Senator Arlen Specter said yesterday.  "We have come to an agreement on what we have called a, quote, 'grand bargain,'" the Pennsylvania Republican said, speaking on the Senate floor.  Majority Leader Harry Reid and other Senate Democrats, including Ted Kennedy, will address the issue at a news conference today.  Reid has set Monday as a deadline to begin debate on an immigration bill.  It is unclear if new legislation will be introduced before then, or if senators will resume debate on the bill that passed last year, when Republicans controlled the Senate.  Last year's bill was drawn along the lines of President Bush's temporary guest-wo!
 rker program, which has been derided by critics -- most of them within his own party -- as granting "amnesty" to illegal immigrants currently in the United States.  The Senate bill was never reconciled with a bill backed by those GOP critics in the House, which limited its measure to border enforcement.
