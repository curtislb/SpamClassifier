Lou Dobbs Tonight
Tuesday June 5, 2007

Join us tonight for a special edition of Lou Dobbs Tonight.
We’ll be warming up for tonight’s Republican Presidential
Debate, where 10 candidates will outline their views for the
American people. One issue dividing the party’s candidates? The
so-called comprehensive immigration reform bill. We’ll hear
where the candidates stand tonight.

The Senate is voting on the nearly 100 amendments included in
the immigration reform grand compromise that would grant
amnesty to the millions of illegal aliens in America.  Join us
tonight for full coverage from Washington on the status of the
votes.

Dozens of Senators were involved in the 1986 amnesty
legislation that resulted in amnesty for nearly 2.7 million
people. Senator Charles Grassley voted for the 1986 amnesty
bill, but he says today’s immigration reform is riddled with
loopholes and flaws. Tonight we take a look at how Senators who
voted for amnesty in 1986 are voting today.

Los Angeles Mayor Villaraigosa says cooperation with the
federal government is needed to crack down on gang violence.
But he says we can’t solve the problem with arrests alone.
Speaking before the Senate Judiciary Committee on gang
abatement, the mayor failed to address that Los Angeles is a
sanctuary city, meaning it prevents officers from questioning
the immigration status of gang members. We’ll have a full
report.

Also today, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales will announce new
indictments of MS-13 gang members – many of whom are living
illegally in this country.

And three of the nation’s best political analysts will join
Lou: Ed Rollins, former White House Political Director, Robert
Zimmerman, Democratic National Committeeman and Michael
Goodwin, Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for the New York
Daily News.

latest commentary as he offers a response to the vigorous
attacks by his critics from both the left wing and the right
wing of this nation's media.

Lou Dobbs lays out his manifesto to save the middle class in
his new book, “War on the Middle Class: How the Government, Big
Business, and Special Interest Groups Are Waging War on the
American Dream and How to Fight Back.” War on the Middle Class
is now on sale in bookstores near you and on Amazon.com and
BarnesandNoble.com.
