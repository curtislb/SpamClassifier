7:50 PM, 6/8/07, Update: Space shuttle Atlantis rockets into orbit=20

Running three months late, the space shuttle Atlantis, carrying seven astro=
nauts and a $367 million set of solar panels, roared to life and raced into=
 orbit today, hot on the trail of the international space station. The shut=
tle's patched-up external fuel tank, its foam insulation heavily damaged by=
 hail in February, appeared to withstand the rigors of launch without shedd=
ing any noticeable foam debris.

With commander Rick Sturckow and pilot Lee Archambault at the controls, Atl=
antis' three hydrogen-fueled main engines roared to life and spun up to ful=
l throttle before ignition of the ship's twin solid-fuel boosters at 7:38:0=
4 p.m.

The fuel-laden 4.5-million-pound spaceship instantly climbed away from pad =
39A at the Kennedy Space Center, wheeled about to line up on a northesterly=
 trajectory and rocketed away up the East Coast to kick off NASA's 118th sh=
uttle flight.

Launch originally was scheduled for March 15, but the flight was put on hol=
d after a freak Feb. 26 hail storm that blasted the top of the tank's foam =
insulation. More than 3,000 dings and gouges had to be repaired with poured=
 or sprayed-on foam insulation, giving the tank a pockmarked, two-tone comp=
lexion.

The first 135 seconds or so of flight are considered the most critical from=
 a debris impact perspective because during that period, the shuttle is sti=
ll in the lower atmosphere. Any lightweight foam that separates from the ta=
nk would decelerate rapidly in the thicker atmosphere, allowing the shuttle=
 to run into it at a high relative velocity. Higher up in thinner air, debr=
is does not slow as rapidly and impact velocities are lower.

While detailed analysis of launch camera and video footage is not yet compl=
ete, television views beamed down from a camera mounted on the side of the =
tank showed what appeared to be one of the cleanest launches yet from a deb=
ris perspective.

Spectacular video showed the separation of Atlantis' twin booster rockets t=
wo minutes and five seconds after launch and then the deep black of space a=
nd the curving horizon of planet Earth as the ship continued its climb to s=
pace. Eight-and-a-half minutes after liftoff, Atlantis slipped into its pla=
nned preliminary orbit.

If all goes well, Sturckow will guide the shuttle to a docking with the spa=
ce station around 3:38 p.m. Sunday afternoon.=20

The primary goal of Atlantis' mission is to attach a huge new set of solar =
panels to the right side of the station's main power truss, along with a po=
werful rotary joint to keep the huge arrays face-on to the sun. The combine=
d truss segments tip the scales at nearly 36,000 pounds, making this one of=
 the heaviest space station payloads to date. The two new solar panels, whe=
n fully extended, will stretch 240 feet from tip to tip and slowly rotate l=
ike giant paddle wheels.

The astronauts also hope to complete the retraction of another set of ident=
ical arrays, used to provide power to the lab complex during the initial st=
ages of assembly, so it can be moved to its permanent position on the left =
end of the power truss later this year.

The crew of shuttle Discovery ran into major problems retracting one side o=
f the P6 array in December and ultimately staged an unplanned spacewalk, ma=
nually shaking free stuck grommets on frayed guide wires to fold the pleate=
d blind-like array into its storage canister. While Atlantis' crew hopes to=
 benefit from lessons learned and retract the remaining blanket automatical=
ly, they will be standing by to provide hands-on spacewalk assistance if ne=
cessary.

Attaching the new $367.3 million S3/S4 solar array truss segments, completi=
ng the retraction of P6 and ultimately re-extending its two wings on the po=
rt side of the main power truss later this year will clear the way for atta=
chment of European and Japanese research modules, both major milestones on =
the road to completing the station in 2010.

"I hesitate to say any part of the sequence is more critical than any other=
," NASA Administrator Mike Griffin told CBS News. "It's a chain and you can=
 break any link, and the chain doesn't function. But you have to recognize =
that the sequence leading up to getting our first international partner mod=
ule, the (European Space Agency's) Columbus lab, up is a very, very signifi=
cant thing. It's going to assume an importance maybe even larger than it re=
ally has just because of the imagery of that."

In August, the shuttle Endeavour will carry supplies to the station and att=
ach a spacer segment to the S4 solar array installed during Atlantis' missi=
on to permit the eventual attachment of a fourth and final set of arrays, k=
nown as S6.

In October, Discovery will deliver a new multi-hatch node called Harmony, t=
emporarily mounting it on the port side of the Unity module that connects t=
he U.S. and Russian segments of the station. The astronauts then will move =
the retracted P6 solar array to its permanent location the left end of the =
main power truss in one of the most challenging assembly tasks yet attempte=
d. If all goes well, the arrays will be re-extended, boosting the station's=
 electrical power.

After Discovery departs, the station crew will use the lab's robot arm to r=
emove the shuttle docking port now on the forward end of the Destiny labora=
tory module and attach it to Harmony. The station astronauts then will move=
 Harmony and its shuttle docking port to the front end of Destiny and stage=
 a series of spacewalks to route power and cooling to the new module.

That will set the stage for the long-awaited December launch of the Columbu=
s research module, which will be attached to Harmony's starboard port. The =
Japanese Experiment Module will be bolted to Harmony's port hatch early nex=
t year.

"Everything now is pretty serial ... it is quite a production," said Anders=
on, a station crew member hitching a ride to the outpost aboard Atlantis. "=
We're going to put those pieces in place one step at a time and then if we =
do have any problems, we'll deal with those one step at a time such that we=
 can get the Columbus module, the JEM modules on board the station, docked =
to Harmony, because that is a huge step to the international capability of =
the station. This is going to be a big four or five flights in a row."

Under the original schedule, Anderson was to launch in June aboard the Ende=
avour, replacing astronaut Sunita Williams aboard the station as a member o=
f the Expedition 15 long-duration station crew.

But during an unusually violent storm that thundered over the launch pad on=
 Feb. 26, Atlantis' external tank was blasted by hail. Most of the damage w=
as restricted to the upper liquid oxygen section of Atlantis' tank and when=
 all was said and done, it took three months to repair. As a result, Atlant=
is' flight slipped to June and Endeavour's to August.

Williams was launched to the space station aboard Discovery last December. =
NASA managers initially said she could safely remain aloft until August but=
 after additional consideration, they decided to bring her home in June, as=
 originally planned, but on mission STS-117 instead of STS-118. Staying up =
through August was not a health threat for Williams, officials said, but he=
r cumulative exposure to space radiation could preclude a future station fl=
ight. And so, the decision was made to bring her back to Earth on schedule =
aboard Atlantis.

At the same time, NASA managers decided to move Anderson, Williams' replace=
ment, from Endeavour to Atlantis.

IWith today's on-time launch, Atlantis is scheduled to undock from the stat=
ion June 17, leaving Anderson behind with Expedition 15 commander Fyodor Yu=
rchikhin and flight engineer Oleg Kotov. Williams will return to Earth with=
 Atlantis' crew, gliding to a touchdown at the Kennedy Space Center around =
2:45 p.m. on June 19.
