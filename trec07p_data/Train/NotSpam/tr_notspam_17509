						<div class=3D"GreyHeading">JONATHAN AGNEW ON 50 YEARS OF TMS</div>
						<div>Test Match Special is celebrating its 50th birthday this summer =
which is a marvellous achievement.
<br>

<br>
It is such a unique programme and it's more than just cricket commentary, i=
t has grown into something different.
<br>

<br>
It's hopefully an intelligent debating forum where people can tell stories =
and have a laugh, but perhaps most importantly of all, listeners have alway=
s been able to enjoy direct contact with the show.=20
<br>

<br>
This was the legacy of the late, great Brian Johnston.
<br>

<br>
He was the master of being able to make people think he was talking to list=
eners as individuals and hopefully that lives on.=20
<br>

<br>
For all of us it's as close to a dream job as we could imagine.=20
<br>

<br>
We are all too old and decrepit to still be playing professional cricket so=
 this is without doubt the next best thing.
<br>

<br>
Our producer Peter Baxter retires at the end of the West Indies series afte=
r an amazing 34 years in the job.
<br>

<br>
His impact on the team has been enormous, he has set the tone for the progr=
amme and I will miss him terribly as he has been my colleague, friend and t=
ravelling companion for 17 years.
<br>

<br>
If I had to pick out my favourite moment working on TMS it would have to be=
 the 2005 Ashes series.
<br>

<br>
More than anything though, and it sounds corny, I just enjoy every day as t=
hey are all so completely unpredictable.
<br>

<br>
And the start of the third Test between England and the West Indies certain=
ly didn't disappoint.
<br>

<br>
England looked to be cruising, but suddenly found themselves struggling aft=
er the West Indies' bowlers finally found the right line.
<br>

<br>
The pitch at Old Trafford has become the fastest in the country, and as we =
saw last year against Pakistan, the pitch can be steepling and uneven.
<br>

<br>
I am very much looking forward to seeing Steve Harmison bowling on it and i=
t will be fascinating to see whether the influence of new bowling consultan=
t Allan Donald will have any effect.
<br>

<br>
Enjoy the action,
<br>

<br>
Aggers=20
<br>

<br>
<B>Jonathan Agnew is part of the Test Match Special team that is commentati=
ng on the third Test between England v West Indies at Old Trafford. You can=
 listen to TMS on BBC Radio 4 198LW and on Five Live Sports Extra on digiti=
al radio from 1045 BST </b>
