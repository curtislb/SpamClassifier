appearance on Capitol Hill:

SESSIONS: "I think the president is wrong to push this piece of legislation so hard after we've demonstrated the flaws
that are in it.  He needs to back off... He needs to help us write a better bill and not push a bill that so many of us
can't support."

Political Hot Topics
(Today's top political stories from news organizations across the country)

BUSH HEADS TO THE HILL: For the first time in five years, President Bush will attend the Senate Republicans' weekly
policy lunch today as he pushes to revive his moribund overhaul of the nation's immigration laws. But even before he
set foot in the Capitol, several Republican senators issued a terse warning yesterday: Don't expect much. In the days
after the broad compromise on immigration collapsed on Thursday, opposition, if anything, appears to have hardened
among some senators who had once been willing to consider the deal. The bill's vociferous critics have also had a long
weekend to throw dirt on its grave. Washington Post: Bush, Senators to Meet on Immigration
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/11/AR2007061101995.html

REID WANTS 20 MORE VOTES BEFORE PUTTING IMMIGRATION BACK ON CALENDAR: The top Senate Democrat said yesterday that
President Bush must prove he can deliver more Republican votes before Democrats will put the immigration bill, which
collapsed last week, back on the Senate schedule. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid told Mr. Bush that the only hope
for the bill is if he delivers the votes of more than 20 Republican senators to break a filibuster and pass the
measure. The Nevada Democrat had a frank assessment of the bill's prospects, saying the 51-member Democratic caucus was
"about maxed out" at the 38 votes they delivered on a test vote on the bill last week 22 short of breaking a
filibuster. They were joined by just seven Republicans one-third of the number Mr. Reid says the president must
deliver. "It's the president's bill," Mr. Reid said, adding that if Democrats are being counted on to supply the
additional votes, "it won't happen." Washington Times: Reid presses Bush over GOP votes
http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20070612-122126-4592r.htm

JUDGE ISSUES "STINGING REJECTION" OF INDEFINITE COMBANTANT DETENTION: The federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., ruled
yesterday that the president may not declare civilians in this country to be "enemy combatants" and have the military
hold them indefinitely. The ruling was a stinging rejection of one of the Bush administration's central assertions
about the scope of executive authority to combat terrorism. The ruling came in the case of Ali al-Marri, a citizen of
Qatar now in military custody in Charleston, S.C., who is the only person on the American mainland known to be held as
an enemy combatant. The court said the administration may charge Mr. Marri with a crime, deport him or hold him as a
material witness in connection with a grand jury investigation. New York Times: Judges Say U.S. Can't Hold Man as
'Combatant' http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/12/washington/12combatant.html

GOP BLOCKS VOTE ON GONZALES: After a short but testy debate in which Republicans attacked their motives, Senate
Democrats came up short — 53-38 — Monday evening in their bid to open debate on a no-confidence motion on embattled
Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. Seven Republicans — Judiciary ranking member Arlen Specter (Pa.), Zombie Smith
(Ore.), Norm Coleman (Minn.), John Sununu (N.H.), Chuck Hagel (Neb.), Susan Collins (Maine) and Olympia Snowe (Maine) —
voted for the motion to proceed to debate on the nonbinding no-confidence resolution. Every Democrat present voted to
invoke cloture. Sen. Joe Lieberman (ID-Conn.) voted against cloture. Eight lawmakers were absent, including three
Democratic presidential candidates — Sens. Joseph Biden (Del.), Barack Obama (Ill.) and Chris Dodd (Conn.)... The mere
scheduling of the vote was a political embarrassment for Gonzales and the White House, despite the fact it was
defeated. Roll Call: Democrats' AG Vote Falls Short http://www.rollcall.com/issues/52_138/news/18893-1.html

ENERGY BILL KICKS OFF "EPIC LOBBYING WAR": Having tried and failed to overhaul the nation's immigration laws last week,
Congress begins what some say is an even more divisive project this week: taming America's thirst for oil. With
gasoline prices hovering near all-time highs, the Senate on Monday began debating a sprawling energy bill that has
already kicked off an epic lobbying war by huge industries, some of them in conflict with one another: car companies,
oil companies, electric utilities, coal producers and corn farmers, to name a few. Industry groups have raced to sign
up influential lawmakers and are nervously calculating how much regulation they might have to accept from the
Democratic majority in Congress. New York Times: Congress Turns to Energy, and Lobbyists Arrive
http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/12/washington/12energy.html

OBEY ISSUES THREAT ON EARMARKS: The Democratic chairman of the House Appropriations Committee threatened Monday to
strip all lawmakers' funding requests from this year's budget if Republicans continue to "demagogue" the controversial
process. The warning from Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin came as he sought to defend his decision to move spending bills
through the House beginning this week without specifying what legislative projects, known as "earmarks," will be added
to them. He said committee staff hasn't had time to wade through about 32,000 requests. When Democrats took over
control of Congress in January, they pledged to make the earmark process more transparent and accountable. The House
passed a rule and the Senate passed a bill outlining a new process in which every earmark and the lawmakers requesting
them would be made public. USA Today: Spending panel chief threatens to axe lawmakers' pet projects
http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20070612/a_earmarks12.art.htm

63 PERCENT SEE "BUSINESS AS USUAL" IN DEM CONGRESS: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who is unifying Democratic lawmakers
and achieving early legislative victories, still is losing support with Americans who don't see Congress producing any
real change. A 39 percent plurality of Americans disapprove of the California Democrat's performance, according to the
latest Bloomberg/Los Angeles Times national survey; 36 percent approve. In January, the new speaker scored a 34 percent
to 21 percent favorable rating. The June 7-10 poll also found that 63 percent of those surveyed said the Democratic
Congress is governing in a "business as usual" manner, while 29 percent said Democrats are working hard to bring
fundamental change to government. Bloomberg: Speaker Pelosi Loses Support as Voters See 'Business as Usual'
http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=washingtonstory&sid=abhNVg8l7rtw

DOCTORS SAY JOHNSON CAN "FULLY RESUME" SENATE DUTIES SOON: South Dakota Sen. Tim Johnson's doctors are saying he soon
will be able to fully resume his senatorial duties. They could not say, however, when Johnson would return to Capitol
Hill. Johnson, who suffered a brain hemorrhage six months ago, has been working from home for several months while he
undergoes physical, speech and occupational therapy several hours a day, five days a week. "He's on a great track, he's
doing well, but he has to keep doing therapy," Johnson's spokeswoman Julianne Fisher said Monday. "It's like looking at
an athlete and saying: 'There won't be a problem. You'll be able to come back to work, but you'll miss a few more
games.'" Sioux Falls Argus Leader: Doctors: Johnson will return to Senate

DEAN PLAYS "CHICKEN" WITH FL DEM LEADERS OVER PRIMARY DATE: Howard Dean, chairman of the Democratic National Committee
(DNC), is trapped in a high-stakes game of chicken with party leaders in Florida. They warned him yesterday not to
"disenfranchise" state voters and risk being blamed for a debacle on the scale of the 2000 recount. The warning comes
amid alarm over a decision Sunday by state Democratic leaders to embrace Jan. 29 as the primary date. They are defying
DNC headquarters and daring it to follow through on its threat to disqualify electors selected in the primary and
punish candidates who campaign there. But the DNC is not backing down. The committee bought time with a statement late
yesterday saying, "The DNC will enforce the rules as passed by its 447 members in Aug. 2006. Until the Florida State
Democratic Party formally submits its plan and we've had the opportunity to review that submission, we will not
speculate further." The Hill: Florida Dems defy Dean on primary date

Q2 FUNDRAISING "UNLIKELY TO ALLEVIATE THE HEADACHES" FOR McCAIN CAMP: Bracing for a fundraising report at the end of
the month that is unlikely to alleviate the headaches that have plagued his campaign, Arizona Sen. John McCain and his
top advisers have fashioned a survival plan they hope will steady his GOP nomination run. For the second time in a row,
McCain could report that he has raised the least of the top three Republican candidates -- slightly, but not
dramatically, more than the $12.5 million that he collected in the first quarter. That disappointing figure provoked a
shakeup in the campaign's structure but has produced only a marginal improvement for the second quarter. McCain aides
will say only that the figure will be more than last time. The Politico: McCain camp enters campaign 'dog days'

REPUBLICANS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF GOLDEN STATE "POLITICAL ATM": U.S. Senator John McCain, pounded from the GOP right by
conservatives on immigration and from moderates on his support for the president's Iraq policies, faces another
challenge this week -- trying to scoop campaign cash from California's political ATM while being elbowed by a crowd of
presidential hopefuls. The presidential candidates who have been crisscrossing the Golden State this week include the
Republican front-runner, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who just concluded a fundraising trip; former
Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who visits Southern California and San Francisco on Wednesday for fundraising; and a
new and potentially formidable GOP challenger, TV actor and former senator Fred Thompson, who scouted the Hoover
Institution at Stanford. San Francisco Chronicle: McCain taps state for funds as TV actor rival visits Stanford
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/06/12/MNGSVQDN0B1.DTL

THOMPSON SURGES IN LATEST LAT/BLOOMBERG POLL: Republicans antsy for a conservative standard-bearer in the presidential
race have begun to rally behind Fred Thompson, propelling the former Tennessee senator to within hailing distance of
the lead for the party's nomination, a new Los Angeles Times/Bloomberg Poll has found. Former New York Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani holds first place in the survey, with support from 27% of the Republicans and independents who said they plan
to vote in the party's 2008 primudles. But Thompson, an actor who played a prosecutor on NBC's "Law & Order," runs just
behind, with 21%. Indications are he will join the race within the next month. The two other major GOP contenders, Sen.
John McCain of Arizona and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, fall well short of the leaders and are in a battle
for third place. McCain was backed by 12% of those polled, Romney by 10%. The rest of the crowded field is mired in
single digits. Among the Democratic candidates, the race remains little changed from a Times/Bloomberg poll in April.

THOMPSON CAMP INQUIRING ABOUT AMES STRAW POLL: Aides to Republican presidential prospect Fred Thompson have inquired
about the Ames straw poll, although the actor and former Tennessee senator has not decided whether to take part in the
August fundraiser, Iowa GOP officials said Monday. "They've asked about the basic temperature of Iowa, how the straw
poll works, how it's operated and the logistics, just like the conversations we've had with others," said Chuck
Laudner, executive director of the Iowa Republican Party. "They've not made a decision on whether to play, but I
imagine it's coming sooner rather than later." Thompson's participation could also help revive the high-profile
precursor to Iowa's leadoff nominating caucuses. Des Moines Register: Thompson aides question Iowa GOP about straw poll
http://desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070612/NEWS09/706120380/1056

CLINTON'S LEAD COMES LARGELY FROM WOMEN: The consistent lead that Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York has
maintained over Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois and others in the race for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination is
due largely to one factor: her support from women. In the most recent Washington Post-ABC News poll, Clinton led Obama
by a 2 to 1 margin among female voters. Her 15-point lead in the poll is entirely attributable to that margin. Clinton
drew support from 51 percent of the women surveyed, compared with 24 percent who said they supported Obama and 11
percent who said they backed former senator John Edwards of North Carolina. Washington Post: Clinton Owes Lead in Poll
To Support From Women http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/11/AR2007061102216.html

INDIAN-AMERICANS WILL RAISE BIG BUCKS FOR HILLARY: Senator Clinton plans to take time out of her tightly packed
presidential campaign schedule next month to deliver a speech to a large and influential alumni group. The
well-connected crowd, expected to number about 4,000, hails not from the Ivy League or one of America's renowned state
universities, but from a school half a world away, the Indian Institute of Technology. The unusual speaking engagement
is just one sign of the growing clout of the Indian-American community and how Mrs. Clinton is harnessing it to a
degree previously unknown in presidential politics. In April, a prominent New York hotelier and restaurant owner, Sant
Chatwal, announced that Indian-Americans plan to raise at least $5 million for the former first lady's presidential
campaign, an impressive sum even at the overheated pace of this year's fund raising. New York Sun: Clinton Taps Newly
Active Indian Donors http://www.nysun.com/article/56332

IN '05, OBAMA WAS LOOKING AT 2012 OR 2016 BID: One evening in February 2005, in a four-hour meeting stoked by pepperoni
pizza and grand ambition, Sen. Barack Obama and his senior advisers crafted a strategy to fit the Obama "brand." The
charismatic celebrity-politician had rocketed from the Illinois state legislature to the U.S. Senate, stirring national
interest. The challenge was to maintain altitude despite the limited tools available to a freshman senator whose party
was in the minority. Yet even in those early days, Obama and his advisers were thinking ahead. Some called it the
"2010-2012-2016" plan: a potential bid for governor or re-election to the Senate in 2010, followed by a bid for the
White House as soon as 2012 or, if not, 2016. The way to get there, they decided, was by carefully building a record
that matched the brand identity: Obama as unifier and consensus-builder, an almost postpolitical leader. Chicago
Tribune: Carefully crafting the Obama 'brand'
http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/chi-obama_senate_recordjun12,1,48733.story

IS DALLAS READY TO ELECT A GAY MAYOR? Handicapping Dallas' mayoral contest in a recent interview, former Mayor Ron Kirk
mentioned one thing as crucial to the candidacy of three-term councilman Ed Oakley: "The question for him is, 'Is
Dallas ready for Ed Oakley?' " If the 54-year-old small-business owner wins Saturday's runoff election, Dallas would
become the first large city in the nation to elect an openly gay mayor. This once-conservative stronghold has by all
accounts become more diverse, more cosmopolitan and more politically liberal. But as city voters have become aware of
Oakley's sexual orientation - which had not been prominently discussed in news coverage until last week - his campaign
staff and key supporters said they are finding they are not quite living in freethinking Paris or Berlin, both led by
gay mayors. Houston Chronicle: Will Dallas make history with gay mayor?
