7:41 AM, 6/14/07, Update: Russian engineers troubleshoot computer problem; =
telemetry restored; false fire alarm sounds=20

Russian engineers cut off U.S. power and attempted to restart critical comp=
uters in the Zvezda command module of the international space station today=
 using power from Russian systems. While the system showed a "heartbeat," f=
light controllers said, they were unable to coax the machines into rebootin=
g during a pass over Russian ground stations.

One orbit later, however, engineers were able to re-establish communication=
s with a central computer in the command module and through it, another com=
puter in the Zarya propulsion and storage module. And for the first time si=
nce the trouble began earlier this week, engineers began receiving a full s=
tream of telemetry from the station to help troubleshoot the issue.

The station's guidance and navigation computers must be restarted before th=
e shuttle Atlantis undocks next week to provide the necessary control over =
critical systems. All three guidance computers, along with three command-an=
d-control computers, crashed earlier this week amid work by the Atlantis as=
tronauts to install a new U.S. solar power array.

Russian engineers said Wednesday the new array, which generates some 22 kil=
owatts of usable electricity, might have caused a subtle change in the stat=
ion's power grid that, in turn, affected the control computers. So far, tha=
t remains speculation.

"In Moscow, they've been working overnight with their team in order to come=
 up with a troubleshooting plan," NASA flight director Holly Ridings said e=
arly today. "They were able to re-establish communications with the central=
 computer. Downstream of that, they have re-established communications with=
 the computer in the FGB (Zarya). Certainly, a lot of good progress overnig=
ht by our Russian colleagues."

Earlier today, space station commander Fyodor Yurckikhin and flight engiene=
er Oleg Kotov tried to help flight controllers diagnose the problem, lookin=
g for signs of any patterns in flashing error messages. The computers seeme=
d locked in a reboot cycle.

"Fyodor, I'm sorry, but so far here on the ground we haven't come together =
with a brainstorm," mission control, speaking through an interpreter, radio=
ed the station.

"Yes, I understand," Yurchikhin replied.

"Hopefully we'll find a decision."

"Well, that's a highly desirable outcome!" Yurchikhin joked.

"Are you up by yourself, or is Oleg next to you?" mission control asked.

"Of course he is up and running, of course he is worried," Yurchikhin said.

"Guys, we are truly sorry."

The Russian space agency does not have its own communications satellites. T=
o troubleshoot the computer problem, Russian engineers have to wait until t=
he station is within line-of-site of Russian ground stations to downlink te=
lemetry and beam up commands.

During a communications pass around 7 a.m., flight controllers reported som=
e success, telling the cosmonauts "at last, for a change, after many hours =
without telemetry we finally have telemetry downstream."

"Well, that's great news," Yurchikhin replied. "I feel much better."

"Of course, I understand."

A few moments later, around 7:23 a.m., a fire alarm sounded in the Zarya mo=
dule as the Russians were attempting to switch the crew's Soyuz lifeboat fr=
om internal power to station power. The Soyuz was put on internal power lat=
e Wednesday as a precaution.

A fire alarm sounded in the Zarya module Tuesday when the computer problems=
 first began occurring. There were no signs of a fire then or this morning.
