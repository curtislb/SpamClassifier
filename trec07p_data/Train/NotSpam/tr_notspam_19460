I think your plot would be more clear if you used two graphics - one
showing the spread, and one showing the number of points (you might
also want to look at notched boxplots).  In the graphic you attached
the bars of the barchart (not histogram! - that's for continuous data)
distract the eye from the boxplots.  You might also want to try
ordering the x axis by mean or number of observations as this will
make it easier to see trends in the data.

The confusion with the barchart arises because there are really two
quite different types of barcharts.  One type is basically the same as
a dotchart, but you draw bars instead of dots - this is the default in
R.  The other type is the categorical analog of the histogram, and
this is the default in ggplot2
(http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/geom_bar.html), allow the next version will
automatically work out which version you want.
