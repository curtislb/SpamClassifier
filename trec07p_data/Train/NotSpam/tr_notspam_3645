ALERT: FDA SEEKS TO REMOVE LABELING REQUIREMENTS FOR IRRADIATED FOODS
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has proposed new federal regulations=
 that will allow manufacturers and retailers to sell controversial irradiat=
ed foods without labeling them, as previously required by law. Consumers ar=
e justifiably wary of foods bombarded with nuclear waste or powerful x-rays=
 or gamma rays--since irradiation destroys essential vitamins and nutrients=
, creates unique radiolytic chemical compounds never before consumed by hum=
ans, and generates carcinogenic byproducts such as formaldehyde and benzene=
. Although irradiation, except for spices, is banned in much of the world, =
and prohibited globally in organic production, U.S. corporate agribusiness =
and the meat industry desperately want to be able to secretly "nuke" foods =
in order to reduce the deadly bacterial contamination that is now routine i=
n industrial agriculture and meat production. OCA and other public interest=
 groups have repeatedly pointed out that the best way to reduce or eliminat=
e America's 78 million cases of food poisoning every year would be to clean=
 up the nation's filthy slaughterhouses and feedlots, stop contaminated run=
off from intensive confinement feedlots from polluting adjacent farms (as i=
n the recent spinach e-coli outbreak), and to stop feeding animals slaughte=
rhouse waste and manure. Instead, FDA and corporate agribusiness have appar=
ently decided, with the backing of the nuclear power and weapons industry, =
to take away consumers' rights to know if their food has been irradiated or=
 not.

ALERT: FDA SAYS ALMONDS LABELED AS 'RAW' CAN ACTUALLY BE PASTEURIZED
Under pressure from industrial agriculture lobbyists, the FDA has quietly a=
pproved a new regulation that will effectively end distribution of raw almo=
nds, while putting many family farmers out of business. The rule requires p=
asteurization of almonds, including organic, yet allows those same almonds =
to continue to be labeled as "raw". Nutritionists point out that raw, organ=
ic almonds are far superior, in terms of nutrition, than pasteurized almond=
s. One of the FDA-recommended pasteurization methods requires the use of pr=
opylene oxide, which is classified as a "possible human carcinogen" by the =
International Agency for Research on Cancer and is banned in Canada, Mexico=
, and the European Union. Organic and family-scale almond farmers are prote=
sting the proposed rule, saying it will effectively put them out of busines=
s, since the minimum price for the pasteurization equipment is $500,000. Th=
e FDA claims pasteurization is necessary, since there have been two food co=
ntamination incidents with raw almonds since 2001. But both of these incide=
nts, in fact, were the result of blatant mismanagement on large industrial-=
scale almond farms. Take action now to demand that the FDA re-open this pro=
posed rule to public comments: http://www.organicconsumers.org/articles/art=
icle_4859.cfm

ALERT: NEW PROPOSED USDA ORGANIC REGULATIONS COULD DRIVE THOUSANDS OF SMALL=
 ORGANIC FARMERS OUT OF BUSINESS
A controversial new directive from the USDA threatens to deny organic certi=
fication to thousands of small organic coffee, tea, banana, rice, sugar can=
e, cacao and other farmers around the world. The USDA's directive would eli=
minate the longstanding practice of certifying organic and Fair Trade famil=
y farm cooperatives as a group, rather than forcing each coop member to pay=
 for individual certification. Thousands of organic and Fair Trade farming =
cooperatives around the world have been established over the past few decad=
es to help low-income farmers in financing and marketing, and in acquiring =
otherwise cost-prohibitive certification for their farms. Most of the world=
's small-scale organic coffee farmers take part in these cooperatives, so e=
liminating group certification, will drive thousands of family farmers out =
of business while giving large-scale commercial coffee plantations a compet=
itive advantage. Though the OCA supports careful monitoring of all organic =
farms, we are adamantly opposed to the elimination of group certification f=
or low-income farm cooperatives.

GOOD NEWS OF THE WEEK:
FDA FORCED TO EXTEND PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD ON FOOD FROM CLONES
Over the past few months, the FDA has received over 100,000 letters from OC=
A network members and other consumers, rejecting proposed federal regulatio=
ns that would allow meat, eggs, and dairy products derived from cloned anim=
als to be put on the market, without safety-testing or labeling. Thanks to =
this massive public backlash, the FDA has been forced to extend its public =
comment period another 30 days (expiring May 3). If you have not yet inform=
ed the FDA about your position on cloned animals and food, please learn mor=
e and take action now: http://www.organicconsumers.org/rd/clones.htm

ALERT: FDA RELEASES 'GUIDANCE' DOCUMENT REGARDING POLICING OF NATURAL HEALT=
H
The FDA has released a new directive that is causing major concern in the n=
atural health community. Although the document does not specifically propos=
e any new federal laws beyond those already in place, the OCA and our allie=
s are keeping a close eye on what this directive might mean in terms of fut=
ure proposed regulations. Specifically, the FDA's guidance statement elabor=
ates on current regulations that state that any product, food, or supplemen=
t making health claims must be carefully policed by the FDA. This has been =
a longtime FDA rule. Notably, the document suggests that foods such as vege=
table juices making health claims must undergo federal monitoring. Because =
this is a "guidance directive," rather than proposed legislation, the OCA i=
s not currently calling for a mass letter writing campaign. But we do encou=
rage organic and alternative health consumers to learn more about this dire=
ctive, to offer individual comments or queries to the FDA, and to remain vi=
gilant.

SURVEY OF THE WEEK:
CONSUMER REPORTS SURVEY FINDS MOST U.S. CITIZENS HEAVILY DISSATISFIED WITH =
FDA

According to a survey published last week by the Consumer Reports National =
Research Center:

    * 4 out of 5 Americans think big pharmaceutical companies have too much=
 control over the FDA.
    * 96 percent believe the government should have the power to require wa=
rning labels on drugs with known safety problems. According to Consumer Rep=
orts, "Right now, the Food and Drug Administration must negotiate safety wa=
rning labels with a drug maker."
    * 84 percent believe that advertisements for prescription drugs with sa=
fety concerns should be outlawed.
    * 92 percent oppose the FDA's practice of allowing drug companies to su=
bmit only positive clinical trials of new drugs while burying negative drug=
 trial results.
    * 93 percent are troubled by the fact that the FDA has no power to do f=
ollow-up safety studies of drugs after they have been allowed to enter the =
market.

TIP OF THE WEEK:
ASK FOR ORGANIC PET FOOD
More than 60 million packages of pet food were recently recalled from store=
 shelves after thousands of pets were poisoned by products containing conta=
minated wheat gluten, imported from China. Following this disaster, thousan=
ds of the nation's pet owners are switching to organic pet foods. Natural a=
nd organic pet food sales increased by 46% last year, and will likely incre=
ase even more this year. As more and more pet owners are learning, conventi=
onal pet foods are loaded with a host of shocking fillers, including contam=
inated slaughterhouse waste and preservatives that are considered too dange=
rous for human foods. It's no wonder that cancer rates for cats and dogs ar=
e skyrocketing. So, next time you're shopping for pet food, consider going =
organic. If organic pet foods are still hard to find, ask your favorite nat=
ural food store or coop to order some for you.
