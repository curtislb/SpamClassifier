Hi,

When I press insert+r in a text editor to start reading an entire document, 
Speakup reads the two first lines only. It reads the line the cursor is 
placed on, and the next line, then it stops reading. Is it possible to 
actually read the entire document at a time?

Also, is there a way to tell Speakup to make pauses at the end of sentences, 
rather than making them at the end of lines?

Many thanks

Cleverson
