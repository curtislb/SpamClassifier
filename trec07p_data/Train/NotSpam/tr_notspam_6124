I still don't see the problem.

First of all, the interpretation we wish to claim consistency under is "all
bits that are distributed by Debian must follow the DFSG".  Copyright law is
not distributed by Debian, and needs no exception.

Second, what will happen in practice is that there will be text that is so
short and functional that it can't be copyrighted.  Example: package is under
the GPL.  The FSF then says "you can reuse the text of the GPL as long as
you change the name".

There's no infinite regress, because "you can reuse the text of the GPL as
long as you change the name" isn't copyrightable.
