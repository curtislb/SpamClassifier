    As I sailed into Shadow, a white bird of my desire came and sat upon my
    right shoulder, and I wrote a note and tied it to its leg and sent it on
    its way.  The note said, "I am coming," and it was signed by me.

    ...

    The sun hung low on my left and the winds bellied the sails and propelled
    me onward.  I cursed once and then laughed.

    I was free and I was running, but I had made it this far.  I now had the
    chance I'd wanted all along.

    A black bird of my desire came and sat on my left shoulder, and I wrote a
    note and tied it to its leg and sent it off into the west.

    It said, "Eric--I'll be back," and it was signed: "Corwin, Lord of Amber."

    A demon wind propelled me east of the sun.

    -- Nine Princes in Amber, Roger Zelazny

On behalf of the Parrot team, I'm proud to announce Parrot 0.4.12 "Of the
Caribbean." Parrot (http://parrotcode.org/) is a virtual machine aimed at
running all dynamic languages.

Parrot 0.4.12 can be obtained via CPAN (soon), or follow the
download instructions at http://parrotcode.org/source.html.
For those who would like to develop on Parrot, or help develop
Parrot itself, we recommend using Subversion or SVK on the
source code repository to get the latest and best Parrot code.

The next release will take place on 19 June 2007.

Parrot 0.4.12 News:
- Build:
 + even more refactorings and improvements in configuration system
 + improved tests and documentation for configuration system
- Languages:
 + Updated abc, PHP ("Plumhead"), Lua, Tcl
 + Reclaimed Lisp

 + minor garbage collector and memory management improvements
 + several memory leaks resolved
 + extended support for compilers other than GCC
 + improved C++ compiler compatibility

Thanks to all our contributors for making this possible, and our
sponsors for supporting this project.

Enjoy!
