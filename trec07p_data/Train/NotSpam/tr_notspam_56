I don't think this is the same. The readahead code
does readahead every time a pread/sendfile is requested
at an offset of (offset % boundary) == 0.

Commit it if you like but my opinion is that
the modules are different enough that I intend
to keep the vfs_readahead one separate.

Also, to use the current one with defaults
that are exactly tuned to Vista you just use :

vfs objects = readahead

and you get the speedup (on Linux at least,
and that's our major platform). I like that
simplicity and I don't want to lose it.

I know you wrote (and like :-) the cacheprime
module, but that was for a very specific SGI
setup as I recall and I don't think they are
similar enough to merge. They *look* similar
but they're doing different things and it'd
be simpler to leave them that way (IMHO).

Jeremy.
