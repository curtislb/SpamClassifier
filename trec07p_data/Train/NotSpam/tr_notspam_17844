earlier attempts by Amazon to get a continuation patent on its infamous
"1-click" patent, it appears that an impatient USPTO examiner has
[1]approved the continuation, apparently because of the [2]failure of
BountyQuest to come up with prior art. This continuation adds claims like
contacting the recipient of an order via e-mail or a phone call to obtain

a print job to an IP-based printer, and the print job becomes corrupted.
We're seeing this with Window's Vista machines. When IPv6 is installed,
this happens without fail. As soon as we remove IPv6, all of our printer
functions return to normal.'"

Lillith writes "The anti-evolution [0]Creation Museum opened last weekend
and [1]Ars took a field trip there and took lots of pictures. 'There were
posters explaining just how coal could be formed in a few weeks as
opposed to over millions of years, and how rapidly the biblical flood
would cover the earth, drowning all but a handful of living creatures.
The flood plays a big part in the museum's attempt to explain away what
we see as millions of years of natural processes. There was also an
explanation as to why, with only one progenitor family, it wasn't
considered incest for Adam and Eve's children to marry each other.'
(Myself, I liked the picture of the velociraptor grazing peacefully next
to Eve, who is wearing some kind of dirndl, in the Garden of Eden.)" The
reporter posted [2]more photos from the museum on Flickr.

The [0]wilderness is encroaching over abandoned towns in the Chernobyl
exclusion zone. One of the elderly residents who refused to evacuate the
contaminated area says packs of wolves have eaten two of her dogs, and
wild boar trample through her cornfield. Scientist are divided as to
whether or not the animals are flourishing in the highly radioactive
environment: "Robert J. Baker of Texas Tech University says the mice and
other rodents he has studied at Chernobyl since the early 1990s have
shown remarkable tolerance for elevated radiation levels. But Timothy
Mousseau of the University of South Carolina, a biologist who studies
barn swallows at Chernobyl, says that while wild animals have settled in
the area, they have struggled to build new populations."

Last week we asked you for questions to pass on to Turbine CEO Jeff
Anderson, about their recently released Lord of the Rings Online
Massively Multiplayer Online Game. There were a ton of great queries, and
unfortunately Mr. Anderson had only a limited time to spare for us. Over
the phone we still managed to discuss a wide variety of topics,
including: their use of the license, lessons learned from the Asheron
games, World of Warcraft impact on the genre, what Tolkien would have
thought, and whether or not they're working on a Linux/Mac client. Make
sure to give them a look, and many thanks again to Mr. Anderson for
taking the time to speak with us.

[1]at least twice as likely to host viruses or malware. The reason why?
'Google reports that IIS is likely used to distribute malware more often
than Apache because many IIS installs are on pirated Windows versions
which aren't configured to automatically download patches. (Even pirated
Windows versions can automatically receive security fixes, however.) Our
analysis demonstrates how important it is to keep web servers patched to
the latest patch level,' Google notes."

Crohn's disease, coronary heart disease, hypertension, rheumatoid
arthritis and type 1 and 2 diabetes. The Wellcome Trust Case Control
Consortium (WTCCC) involved 50 leading research groups analyzing the DNA
from 2,000 patients for each of the seven conditions and 3,000 healthy

portscan writes "This week's Economist has [0]a special report on Apple,
Inc. and innovation. 'The fourth lesson from Apple is to "fail wisely".
The Macintosh was born from the wreckage of the Lisa, an earlier product
that flopped; the iPhone is a response to the failure of Apple's original
music phone, produced in conjunction with Motorola. Both times, Apple
learned from its mistakes and tried again. Its recent computers have been
based on technology developed at NeXT, a company Mr Jobs set up in the
1980s that appeared to have failed and was then acquired by Apple. The
wider lesson is not to stigmatize failure but to tolerate it and learn
from it: Europe's inability to create a rival to Silicon Valley owes much
to its tougher bankruptcy laws.' There is also an article on the
[1]business of the iPhone and the future of the company. "

abhinav_pc writes "PC World is reporting that [0]Mozilla today made an
early testing release available from [1]its Firefox 3 browser. This alpha
version (code-named Gran Paradiso) for the first time adds the
anticipated Places feature for bookmarks. Firefox 3 alpha 5 also features
a [2]new password manager. A new crash reporting system called
[3]Breakpad is also now available in some Mac OS X and Windows builds but
is not yet supported on Linux. 'Places will also be less likely to lose
data in the event of program or Windows crashes. In fact, according to
Connor, "We haven't figured out how to make Places lose data." For
backwards compatibility and manual backups, Firefox 3 will save bookmarks
in the traditional bookmarks.htm file when it closes. For other bookmark
upgrades, Mozilla is planning to enable bookmark tagging, and is
considering building its own synchronization client into the browser
capable of backing up and sharing bookmarks. '"

[0]whitehartstag writes with a link to a Network World article about
[1]statements from Xandros in the wake of their Microsoft deal. Xandros
CEO Andreas Typaldos made a point of stating that they don't believe
their product violates any of Microsoft's patents. Nor, he said, did the
software giant share with them exactly which patents they believe Linux
violates. Just the same, he's disappointed with the reaction they've
received from the open source community. "Feedback from the Linux
community has been on the order of 'you shouldn't really be talking to
the devil.' Linux and open-source advocates believe it is a big issue and
say the Xandros deal, and another signed by Novell with Microsoft last
year, erodes open source licensing provisions especially around
intellectual property issues. Indeed, the Free Software Foundation is
rewriting its GNU General Public License (GPL) 3.0 to prohibit such
patent deals in the future."

[0]NewYorkCountryLawyer writes "In a decision that could have
far-reaching implications, a federal court in Pennsylvania has held that
the California arbitration clause in the 'take it or leave it' clickwrap
agreement on the Second Life website is [1]unconscionable, and therefore
unenforceable. In its [2]decision (pdf) in Bragg v. Linden Research, Inc.,
No. 06-4925 (E.D. Pa. May 30, 2007), the Court concluded that the Second
Life [3]'terms of service' seek to impose a one-sided dispute resolution
scheme that tilts unfairly, 'in almost all situations,' in Second Life's
favor. As a result, the case will stay in Pennsylvania federal court,
instead of being transferred to an arbitration forum in California."

notthatwillsmith writes "ATI's internal CableCard readers are finally
available, and Maximum PC got hands-on time with a couple of
Vista-powered systems built using the FCC-mandated technology. The short
version? [0]It doesn't work. From the article: 'The tech told me he'd
receive training direct from Microsoft, but none of it covered internal
tuners. We both agreed that the process should be the same, since the
only difference is that the slots are inside the case, versus in an
external box. The tech then proceeds to install the CableCards, connect
the tuners to coax line, fire up the PC, and begin the software
configuration. This step involves activating the TV Wonder with a
product-activation code, and calling the Comcast office to exchange some
information. We should have had a picture at this point, but we didn't.'"

[0]mikemuch writes "It's been a while since AOL stopped trying to jam
third-party IM clients, and their use is now a fairly common desktop
experience. ExtremeTech has posted a roundup of [1]free alternatives to
the standard IM software from the big boys â€” AIM, Yahoo Messenger, and
MSN (now Windows Live) Messenger. The products are a mixed bag, some of
them Web 2.0-based, like the excellent [2]meebo and the ad-heavy
[3]eBuddy. Most give you combined message windows with tabs. GAIM is now
[4]Pidgin, [5]Meetro tries to get you chatting with locals, and
[6]Trillian, now at version 3.1, remains the client to beat."
