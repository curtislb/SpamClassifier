I mean to use one mmap per record type. The current scheme is ugly  
because it really doesn't want to be a proper allocator but it has to  
deal with 2 different sizes of records in the mmap. If you have a  
separate mmap for each record type, the allocator goes back to being  
nice and simple.

No, I'm referring to the allocation of metric records inside the mmap.

That sounds neat. It would be great if you had some code to reconcile  
the existing profiling stats with these metrics.

Do you mean the stats that currently live in the sysv shared memory  
segment?

IIRC you only get a big performance hit when you are timing  
operations. You can probably avoid this (to some degree) by using  
platform-specific timers.

IMHO, the Samba PMDA belongs in the PCP tree, not in the Samba tree.  
Since you are going to be the one maintaining it, it's easier all  
round if it lives there. We can simply remove the existing PMDA from  
the Samba tree.
