HEADLINES:
PRES. BUSH: NO “PIECEMEAL FUNDING” FOR WAR
Today President Bush said he will veto any bill from Congress with "haphazard, piecemeal funding," but agrees that setting benchmarks is a good way to evaluate the Iraq war's progress.  Mister Bush said he has asked his chief of staff, Josh Bolton, to find common ground with Republicans and Democrats in Congress on benchmarks.  The president made his remarks after a meeting at the Pentagon with Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Marine General Peter Pace, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Joint Chiefs members also attended.  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid welcomed the president's willingness to set benchmarks, but added that "simple benchmarks without any consequences" would not be enough.  “In addition to fully funding the troops, Congress believes the best way to change course in Iraq is to redeploy our forces from Iraq; refocus the mission of the remaining forces on security, training and counterterror operations; launch a diplomatic, economic and political offens!
 ive; and hold Iraq accountable, including meaningful benchmarks for the Iraqi government and security forces -- and consequences if they do not," he said in a written statement.  The Bush administration has asked for more than $95 billion to pay for the costs of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, most of which would go to Iraq.  But after the president’s veto of the measure calling for U.S. troops to leave Iraq by March 2008, Democratic leaders of the House of Representatives proposed a short-term spending bill that would fund U.S. combat operations into July.

BAGHDAD BLOODSHED: 20 SLAIN BODIES FOUND; 2 KILLED IN MOTORCYCLE BLAST
Today, police in Baghdad found 20 bullet-riddled bodies across the capital, the Interior Ministry said.  This brings the number of corpses found slain in the war-torn city this month to 219. People killed and left on the street are thought to be victims of Sunni-Shiite fighting.  Meanwhile, a suicide car bomb struck a U.S. military convoy in central Baghdad today and burned a U.S. Humvee, the Iraqi Interior Ministry said.  U.S. soldiers sealed off the area, and there are no details about injuries.  And a parked motorcycle detonated near an outdoor market in the Zafanariya district of southeast Baghdad. Two people were killed and four were wounded, the ministry said.

FORMER ALABAMA TROOPER FACES MURDER CHARGES IN CIVIL RIGHTS-ERA KILLING
A former Alabama state trooper has turned himself in to face murder charges in a 1965 killing that led to the Selma-to-Montgomery voting rights march later that year, the district attorney in Perry County, Alabama, said today.  James B. Fowler, 73, was released on $250,000 bond after surrendering to authorities in Marion, about 75 miles west of Montgomery, District Attorney Michael Jackson said. A special grand jury indicted Fowler on first and second-degree murder charges yesterday in the killing of Jimmie Lee Jackson.  "We think we have a strong case, and we look forward to presenting this to a jury," the district attorney, who is not related to the victim, tells CNN.  Jackson died eight days after being shot in the stomach during a February 18, 1965, clash between state troopers and civil rights protesters marching in support of a jailed voting-rights activist. He was 26.  Fowler has said the shooting was in self-defense. His lawyer, George Beck, tells CNN that Fowler's i!
 ndictment is, "very discouraging to him, obviously, at his age, having to defend himself from what he thought was a reasonable act at the time."

EVENFLO EMBRACE INFANT CAR SEAT/CARRIERS RECALLED
A defect that can lead to infants falling out of Evenflo Embrace Infant car seat/carriers has forced a recall, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and Evenflo Company Inc. announced today.  Evenflo said that when the device is used in the carrier mode the handle can unexpectedly release, causing the seat to rotate forward, and the infant to fall.  The units, manufactured in the United States and China, were sold nationwide through department and baby items stores from December 2004 through September 2006, according to a release from NHTSA.  The recall affects about 450,000 Evenflo Embrace Infant car seat/carriers made before April 8, 2006.  The announcement comes after Evenflo received 679 reports of handles unexpectedly releasing.  The company reported 160 injuries to children, including a skull fracture, two concussions, cuts, scrapes and bruises.  Evenflo is sending a notice to all registered owners of the car seats a!
 nd carriers and will send a free repair kit to strengthen the handle latch, the release said.  The company instructs consumers not to use the handle until the unit has been repaired. The device can still be used as a car seat, the company said in its own release.  Consumers can contact the company through www.embracehandle.com.

GIULIANI STANDS BY HIS VIEW ON ABORTION
Republican presidential hopeful Rudy Giuliani will fully outline his views on abortion prior to next week's Republican debate in South Carolina, Giuliani advisers tell CNN.  The former New York City mayor's remarks will reassert his personal opposition to abortion, but also emphasize his support for a woman's right to choose, the advisers said.  Giuliani has come under fire for fumbling an answer he gave on this controversial issue during last week's Republican debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.  One adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, acknowledged that Giuliani was subject to sharp criticism for his handling of the question at the debate, but noted the campaign is confident that when given more time, Giuliani will be able to fully explain his position.  "Because of the spinout from the first debate, we're going to say 'this is where we're at' and that's that," said the adviser, who added this will not be an "abortion speech" and Giuliani "is not!
  going to be the abortion candidate."  Yesterday, the former mayor addressed the subject during a campaign stop in Huntsville, Alabama, and there is a chance he will discuss it again at an event being held tomorrow in Houston.  "I oppose abortion as a matter of morality, of personal morality, would advise a person, if they asked for my advice, not to have an abortion and give them all the support they needed to make another choice," Giuliani said at the Huntsville event. "And I would hope they would have the information available to make that choice.”  “I also believe that ultimately I have to respect the fact that other people disagree with that," he added.
