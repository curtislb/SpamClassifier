ComeBack writes "Steaks, pork chops, milk and other products from cloned
livestock would have to be [0]clearly labeled on grocers' shelves under a
bill pending in the California Legislature. If passed, the requirement

Administration is poised to give final approval to meat and milk from

proposing to build an underground [1]tunnel between Russia and Alaska for
transporting goods, electricity and natural resources. The tunnel would
be twice as long as that between the UK and France. The $10 — $12b cost

pay it off in 20 years. It would take 10 to 15 years to build, but being
an Alaskan, it sounds good to me!"

FutureDomain sends us to a PC World report on the filing yesterday of
[0]legislation to overhaul the US patent system completely. The US has
the only system worldwide that tries to ascertain who first invented a
thing — everywhere else the criterion is who filed first, and the new
legislation would bring the US into line. Identical bills were introduced
in both the House and the Senate by, in each case, bipartisan sponsors.
The corporate roster of backers includes Microsoft, IBM, Amazon, and
nearly everyone else. From the article: "The provisions of the Patent
Reform Act would... restrict damages that patent holders can receive for
infringement lawsuits, create a new procedure to challenge the validity
of a patent after it has been granted, and boost resources for the US
Patent and Trademark Office."

Bruce Schneier has up at Wired a typically thoughtful piece on how, in
the security market as in others, the [0]lemons are winning out over the
good products. Schneier harks back to "The Market For Lemons," the 1970s
work of economist George Akerlof, to explain why the market's invisible
hand pushes most of the best products into the abyss: "With so many
mediocre security products on the market, and the difficulty of coming up
with a strong quality signal, vendors don't have strong incentives to
invest in developing good products. And the vendors that do tend to die a
quiet and lonely death."

Ore, a [1]major police investigation aimed at catching online pedophiles.
This has resulted in several high-profile arrests, such as those of Pete
Townshend and Robert Del Naja (both falsely accused), while attracting
significant press attention. Yet, the reality of the investigation is one
of stolen credit cards, wrongful accusations, and ignorance leading to a
significant number of the 7,292 people on the list being wrongfully
accused of a very emotionally charged crime. There have been 39 suicides
and a number of other people on the list will probably never be
investigated. It seems to me this case highlights flaws inherent in the
way law enforcement agencies handle evidence that only a small minority

A number of readers sent us links to a BBC story on Microsoft's plan to
provide the [0]"Microsoft Student Innovation Suite" for $3 to governments
around the world, for use in schools. The suite contains Windows XP
Starter Edition and Windows Office Home and Student 2007, along with
other educational software. To qualify, a government would have to
provide free PCs to schools. Microsoft's stated goal is to double the
number of PCs in use (and running Windows). An unbiased observer might
wonder about an agenda of slowing the OLPC project and the spread of open
source in general.

Edgeline technology is said to be so ink-efficient that if HP were to

consumables (cartridges etc) now."

An anonymous reader writes "Ars Technica has a story up about an estimate
done by the Software Freedom Law Center of [0]how much purchasers of
Microsoft Windows are paying in 'patent taxes'. 'SFLA took the total of
$4.3 billion dollars in legal costs for Microsoft from 2001 to 2004 and
divided it by estimated sales of Windows XP over the same period —
approximately 200 million copies — to come up with the $21.50 estimate.
The organization added that North American and European customers, who
pay more for Windows licenses than customers in other parts of the world,
actually ended up paying more of this patent tax, and that people who
pirate Windows pass their share of the tax on to paying customers.' The
article goes on to point out several flaws in the study's logic. For
example, the actual cost of a Windows OEM hasn't increased in the last
few years; Microsoft isn't passing this cost directly on to the
consumer."

SushiVSYamcha writes with a link to an article on the Seattle Times site,
discussing [0]the newly-heated Asian space race. Following Russia and the
US into orbit are the nations of Japan and China, now struggling to
one-up the other in a competition for scientific and national pride. The
piece covers Japan's new initiative to catch up to the Chinese program,
as well as some history of the competition "China launched its first
manned space flight in 2003. A second mission in 2005 put two astronauts
into orbit for a week, and a third manned launch is planned for next
year. This year, China also plans to launch a probe that will orbit the
moon. Earlier this month, the country launched a Long March 3-A rocket
that sent a navigation satellite into orbit as part of its effort to
build a global positioning system. The satellite is the fourth China has
launched as part of the Compass navigation system, which is expected to
be operational in 2008."

cyberianpan writes "According to a Times Online article, [0]MySpace is
going into the news business. They'll soon be premiering a service that
will scour the internet for news stories and let users vote on which ones
receive the most exposure. This approach blends elements of Google News
and sites such as Digg and Netscape, which rely on readers to submit
stories and determine their prominence. One could see where this might be
the 'holy grail' of internet news. Not only will you be able to tap into
the wisdom of the crowds, but ultimately your recommended stories could
be influenced by the likes and dislikes of your friends/heroes."

company said its customers have been asking for XP as part of its

product ideas. Starting immediately, Dell said, it is adding XP Home and

techdirtfeed writes "For years, plenty of folks (including the Government
Accountability Office) have been pointing out that [0]the way the FCC
measures broadband competition is very flawed. It simply assumes that if
a single household in a zip code is offered broadband by provider A, then
every household in that zip code can get broadband from provider A. See
the problem? For some reason the FCC still hasn't changed its ways, but
at least they're starting to realize the problem. They're now saying
[1]they need to change the way they measure competition. Commissioner
Michael Copps points out: 'Our statistical methodology seems almost
calculated to [2]obscure just how far our country is falling behind many
other industrialized nations in broadband availability, adoption, speed
and price.'"

[0]taoman1 wrote with news of a CNN article about a suit brought against
Yahoo! for alleged aiding in human rights violations. The World
Organization for Human Rights USA has filed suit against the search
company for (so the suit claims) assisting in torture by [1]revealing
information that led to the arrest of dissidents. "The lawsuit cites
federal laws that govern torture and other violations of international
law. Plaintiffs included jailed dissident Wang Xiaoning and his wife, Yu
Ling, who was visiting San Francisco this week as part of the group's
campaign. Sklar said he knew of three other cases, but the dissidents
were reluctant to join the complaint for fear of harm to their families
living in China. Among those three dissidents is journalist Shi Tao, who
was sentenced in 2005 to 10 years in jail."

An anonymous reader writes "Wired magazine has an article that explains
[0]The Law of Optical Volumes, a formula for spacing the letters on a
printed page that results in maximum readability. Wired's new logo (did
anyone notice?) obeys the law. Unfortunately, Web fonts don't allow
custom kerning pairs, so you can't work the same magic online as in
print. Could this be why some people still prefer newspapers and
magazines to the Web?"
