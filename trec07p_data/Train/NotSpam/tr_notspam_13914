It's not Parrot that makes them possible, but it certainly makes them 
easier. Ask Patrick about his experiences writing the initial version of 
PGE in C sometime. I certainly wouldn't want to write TGE in straight C. 
Sometimes a layer of abstraction can make such a large difference in how 
easy it is to tackle a problem, that it's just not worth the hassle of 
doing it without the layer of abstraction.
