Zack, how did you get your Orca running with Espeak?  Did you use the 
backend for speech-dispatcher?  If so, where did you put the .py file 
that you have to download?  I got ubuntu installed, and Orca is 
running, but doesn't seem as responsive as it should be.  If you or 
anyone know how to get the experimental backend running, please let 
me know.  There might even be an update to it now, the docs on it are 
still from last summer some time.  Thanks much in advance for the help.

Later,


Guy
P.S.  If I have to go through gnomespeech, how can I play system 
sounds and music files at the same time?
