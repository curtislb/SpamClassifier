I've never had a problem with any ftp client (including ncftp) from  
just typing get file1
then without waiting for it to finish processing that command, or even  
while it's downloading, simply type get file2, and it queues them  
automatically.  So, when file1 is finished, it automatically starts  
getting file2.
I'm sure there's a setting somewhere in the config files that will  
tell it to get them in sequence or simultaneously, but I've never  
fiddled with that, and my files always come down one after the other.

I.E. you don't have to wait for file1 to be finished before asking for  
file2, but it will wait until file1 is finished before getting file2  
anyway.
This works for standard ftp as well.
(never used lftp, so can't comment)

The reason this works is because when you type a new command, it  
simply goes into the buffer, and the ftp program processes the input  
buffer *after* it's finished what it's doing at the moment.
