A big one of those concerns is the way it combines barely-related topics
of copyright and patents into one licence.  The FSF has been warning for
years against 'Intellectual Property' confusion, so it is surprising to
see the GPL becoming more of an IP licence, helping to spread software
patent licensing into swpat-free jurisdictions.  Will they stop that?

In practical terms, it seems to be combined copyright-trademark licences
that cause more problems for debian and GPL is no worse in that way.

While I'm writing anyway:

FDL, please.  It's not GGPL.

Good luck,
