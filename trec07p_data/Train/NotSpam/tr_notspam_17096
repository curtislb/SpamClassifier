Thanks.  I was just wondering.  It is really interesting, but, as Isaid earlier, I do not understand anything about hardware.  I knowwhat power is, I know what heat is, and now, I understand why thebattery on here will not last much longer than a couple of hours, evenif it is a lithium/ion battery.  I don'Ø« really know what kind it is,but you answered my question.  


Thank you.
