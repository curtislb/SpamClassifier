						<b>Blair: the final countdown</b>
<br>

<br>
Ten years down - how many days to go? This morning, perched on a breakfast =
TV sofa, Tony Blair promised to "say something definitive" about his plans =
for stepping down as Prime Minister.=20
<br>

<br>
A few hours later he was in Edinburgh where he gave his most explicit endor=
sement to Zombie Brown, telling the assembled throng "In all probability, a=
 Scot will become prime minister of the United Kingdom." So far so good for=
 Zombie Brown.=20=20
<br>

<br>
Unfortunately, a Newsnight poll will make uncomfortable reading for the man=
 who would be PM. Almost three quarters of respondents think there should b=
e a General Election soon after Blair steps down - more disturbing still, t=
his was true of even the majority of those who describe themselves as Labou=
r voters.=20=20
<br>

<br>

<br>
So, what lies ahead for Brown and the party he wants so desperately to lead=
? Michael Crick will be reporting from Scotland and we'll be talking live t=
o Hazel Blears and the SNP leader, Alex Salmond.
<br>

<br>
<b>Operation Crevice</b>
<br>

<br>
Pressure is growing for a public inquiry into MI5's handling of intelligenc=
e before the July 7 bombings - despite yesterday's verdict, there are many =
questions yet to be answered.=20
<br>

<br>
Our correspondent Richard Watson, who first broke the story that Mohammed S=
idique Khan was under surveillance a year before 7/7, has new detail on who=
 knew what and when? We'll be speaking to the former Chairman of the Intell=
igence and Security Committee, Lord Tom King.
<br>

<br>
<b>Iraq</b>
<br>

<br>
Amidst disputed reports that the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq has been killed=
, our diplomatic editor, Mark Urban, who is in Baghdad, has been talking to=
 the Defence Secretary, Des Browne - and asking him whether the continued B=
ritish presence in Iraq hasn't served merely to aggravate matters there.=20=
=20
<br>

<br>
<b>Chinese maths puzzle</b>
<br>

<br>
His encounter with A-level physics might not have been an unqualified succe=
ss - but this hasn't stopped Steve Smith going where other science students=
 may fear to tread.=20
<br>

<br>
He's taken his protractor and calculator to spend the afternoon with a soft=
ware engineer from Shoreham who successfully solved a maths problem, taken =
from a Chinese university entry test, set by the Royal Society of Chemistry=
 to illustrate how much Chinese science students are outstripping their UK =
counterparts.
