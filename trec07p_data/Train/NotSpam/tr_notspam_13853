Hiya,
    I've successfully installed GRML to my hard disk.  Software speech seems to work quite well now, though the need to add an extra command at the end puzzles me.  What exactly is swspeak supposed to do?  Can I automate it?  Is there a way to make this system more Debian-like?
Thanks muchly,
Zack.
