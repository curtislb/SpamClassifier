With the third case ("all other altered copies") which is what would apply=
=20
if you start changing the manual, you've got to:

  1) Maintain credit for previous authors.

This is fine. Most free licenses, like the GPL, require you to keep the=20
copyright notice as-is; this is even less restrictive.

  2) Put your contact information.

This is fine. Many free licenses, like the GPL, require you to mark altered=
=20
copies with the date of modification; this is even less restrictive.

  3) Don't add any further restrictions.

This is fine. However, you can't further restrict things, so you basically=
=20
have to use the same license. This is basically a (non-GPL compatible) form=
=20
of copyleft.

It's DFSG free, but it doesn't seem GPL compatible because of #3. I could=20
see the documentation being under a different license as the code being=20
slightly annoying, but not a DFSG problem.
