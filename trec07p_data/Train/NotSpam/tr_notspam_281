06:30 p.m., 04/09/07, Update: Soyuz docks with space station; NASA announce=
s Russian contract extension

A Russian Soyuz spacecraft carrying two fresh crew members and a wealthy Am=
erican space tourist docked with the international space station today to c=
lose out a two-day orbital chase. NASA, meanwhile, announced a $719 million=
 contract extension with the Russian federal space agency to, in part, prov=
ide the Soyuz lifeboats and supplies needed to eventually boost the station=
's crew size from three to six.

With spacecraft commander Oleg Kotov monitoring an automated approach, the =
Soyuz TMA-10 spacecraft docked at the downward facing port of the Russian Z=
arya module at 3:10 p.m. as the two spacecraft sailed high above Eastern Eu=
rope.

Joining Kotov in the cramped capsule were Expedition 15 commander Fyodor Yu=
rchikhin and U.S. software developer Charles Simonyi, who paid the Russians=
 more than $20 million to become the fifth private citizen to visit the spa=
ce station.

"Contact and capture, docking confirmed, at 11:10 p.m. Moscow time (3:10 p.=
m. EDT)," said NASA commentator Rob Navias from the Russian mission control=
 center. "Docking confirmed, a perfect arrival. Soyuz TMA-10 has arrived at=
 the international space station."

Martha Stewart, a close friend of Simonyi who attended launch at the Baikon=
ur Cosmodrome, was on hand at the Russian control center in Korolev for tod=
ay's docking. She spoke to Simonyi during a brief welcome-aboard ceremony.

"The launch was beautiful, Charles," Stewart radioed. "I just want you to k=
now we all think you are intrepid, a pioneer and above all - guess what? - =
you're out of this world!"

"Martha, it's really an honor to be at this outpost," Simonyi replied, smil=
ing and looking relaxed. A few moments later, he flipped about 180 degrees,=
 putting himself upside down relative to his crewmates as Yurchikhin and Ko=
tov spoke to family members.

Earlier, Simonyi said he had written out "three or four pages, handwritten =
pages of notes" describing Saturday's launching and the two-day orbital ren=
dezvous aboard the Soyuz TMA-10 and "I'm very anxious to transcribe them" f=
or posting on his blog. "I wrote down practically every interesting moment =
of the flight."

Yurchikhin and Kotov will replace Expedition 14 commander Mike Lopez-Alegri=
a and cosmonaut Mikhail Tyurin, who were launched to the station last Sept.=
 18 aboard the Soyuz TMA-9 spacecraft currently docked to the aft port of t=
he Zvezda command module.

Lopez-Alegria, Tyurin and Simonyi will return to Earth aboard the TMA-9 spa=
cecraft April 20 after a 12-day handover period to familiarize the incoming=
 cosmonauts with space station operations. Astronaut Sunita Williams, who j=
oined the Expedition 14 crew in December after launch aboard the shuttle Di=
scovery, will remain aboard the station with Yurchikhin and Kotov, returnin=
g to Earth aboard the shuttle Endeavour later this summer.

Lopez-Alegria eclipsed the American single-mission record of 196 days April=
 2. With landing April 20, the new record for longest time aloft on a singl=
e mission by a U.S. astronaut will stand at 214 days. Williams will beat th=
at mark and set a new U.S. endurance record when she ultimately lands on th=
e shuttle.

Her return date is not yet known because it depends on when the shuttle Atl=
antis finally takes off on the flight before hers, a mission delayed by hai=
l damage to the ship's external fuel tank.

"I wish you the utmost success in your mission on behalf of NASA," NASA ast=
ronaut Mike Baker radioed the station crews today from the Russian control =
center. "Fyodor, it's good to see you, you look good, Oleg, you look great,=
 too, and Charles, welcome to space, all of you.  Michael, Misha and Sunita=
, we look forward to seeing you soon. And Suni, we're still working on your=
 ride home."

NASA plans a teleconference Tuesday to discuss the progress of work to repa=
ir Atlantis's external fuel tank. A news conference with the combined crews=
 of the station also is on tap Tuesday afternoon.

In other space station developments, NASA today announced a $719 million mo=
dification to a current contract with the Russian Federal Space Agency "for=
 crew and cargo services through 2011."

"The firm-fixed price extension covers crew rotations for 15 crew  members,=
 six in 2009, six in 2010 and three in 2011, delivery and the  removal of 5=
.6 metric tons of cargo," NASA said in a statement. "U.S. Commercial Orbita=
l Transportation Services (COTS) are still planned to provide the bulk of c=
argo transportation needs from 2010 and beyond to the space station."

NASA plans to retire the space shuttle in 2010 and replace it with the Orio=
n crew exploration vehicle, an updated Apollo-style capsule that will be sa=
fer and less expensive to operate. But Orion will not be ready for use unti=
l 2014 or 2015, forcing NASA to buy seats on Russian Soyuz spacecraft to fe=
rry U.S. astronauts to and from the space station in the interim.

In the near term, NASA, the Russians and their international partners want =
to boost the station's permanent crew from three to six. But to do so requi=
res additional three-seat Soyuz spacecraft to serve as lifeboats and to fer=
ry crew members to and from the outpost. Additional supplies also are neede=
d.

The statement said NASA would pay the Russians to launch 1.4 metric tons of=
 cargo to the station inside a Russian docking cargo module scheduled for l=
aunch in 2010 and  pay for a Russian Soyuz flight to and from the station i=
n 2009 to honor a previous commitment to launch an international partner as=
tronaut to the outpost.
