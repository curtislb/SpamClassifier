EU in danger of breaking its promise to the poor

Published: May 24 2007 15:16 | Last updated: May 24 2007 15:16

 From Mr Carlos Correa and others.

Sir, The relationship between Europe and its former colonies in among
the African, the Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) countries has always
involved a promise: that Europe would be an ally in their struggle
against poverty and efforts to develop. That promise is in danger of
being broken.

In its economic partnership agreement (EPA) negotiations with the ACP,
the European Union seems to have forgotten the development dimension
and pursues an agenda that reflects primarily the interest of the EU
alone. This pattern is painfully evident in the EU’s pursuit of new and
higher standards for intellectual property and other trade-related
areas. The EU is asking ACP countries, most of whom which are
least-developed countries, to:

• Make it more difficult for their students and academics to access and
afford educational materials on the internet, for example by enforcing
digital locks on information that should be publicly accessible;

• Impede their researchers and technicians from as they seek to
accessing information and tools needed for their work, and limit the
means available for poor countries to achieve their own technological
development;

• Restrict the full and traditional right of their farmers to save,
re-use, exchange and sell the seeds produced from their harvests,
making them dependent on global multinationals for their food security
and threatening agricultural biodiversity.

The EU argues that the economic partnership agreements are necessary to
comply with World Trade Organisation rules. While there is some dispute
about the necessity of this with respect to goods, it is unequivocally
clear that there is no WTO-related requirement to negotiate
intellectual property.

All available evidence indicates that increased levels of greater
intellectual property protection will generate more costs than benefits
to for ACP countries. Indeed, European countries only gradually
expanded that protection as they reached higher levels of development.
This possibility will be denied to ACP countries.

If the EU really wants to keep its promise to reduce poverty and
promote sustainable development, it should refrain from asking its
poorer trade partners to adopt intellectual property standards that may
retard rather than foster their social and economic improvement.
