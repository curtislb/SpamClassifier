Simple because I would like to use Debian GNU/Linux or Debian
GNU/kFreeBSD Lenny Desktop. :)

Considering that I'm the maintainer and that the split was also
discussed with Daniel Holbach that also does artwork related
packaging, I felt free to post only a summary and didn't go down to
the further details.

uh, no? desktop-base was just our safe net to implement common debian
desktop artwork for Etch. It can (and probably will) be only a
transitional package in the near future.

debian-desktop-artwork will contain GNOME, KDE and Xfce updated
debian-moreblue themes and room for custom Debian Distributions add
their own stuff, pretty much what we've into desktop-base now.

The regular Debian Desktop user shouldn't need to open a terminal to
make backups, but actually he can do it without a script. I agree with
the auto mounting stuff and I would prefer call this
debian-desktop-utils.

derivative is something we don't need to support, but custom debian
distributions yes. Actually distroX-desktop-base is a reality with the
alternatives we've in place for desktop-base, did you see?

No, we won't split it (again) and miss the first point that guided us
to reunite here during Etch development cycle.

Believe in me, it really is. I also work on a mainly pt_BR CDD and the
current desktop-base approach doesn't fail on this camp. The point of
renaming is that add utils and artwork in a package called 'base' is
confusing, what isn't base then?
