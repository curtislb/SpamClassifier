<strong>Raw Politics tonight: Immigration bill called illegal, Dems find success online</strong>

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The White House and top senators called it a breakthrough agreement on immigration reform, but now some House members are calling the deal struck last week a violation of the rule of law...and they say it is destined for failure, CNN's Tom Foreman reports in tonight's "Raw Politics."

Also, in the battle of the internet, Democrats have taken a shocking lead. The top three Democrats are raising twice as much money on the internet as the top Republicans.

And it could be a great catchy phrase, or a terrific misstep: the campaign to make B.O. popular.

<em>Tom Foreman's got the Raw Politics, tonight on Anderson Cooper 360, 10.p.m. ET</em>
