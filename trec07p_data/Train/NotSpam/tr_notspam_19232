10:43 AM, 6/14/07, Update: Astronauts gear up for solar array retraction; s=
pacewalk blanket repair practice=20

Amid troubleshooting in Russia to recover critical space station navigation=
 and control computers, the Atlantis astronauts face a busy day of work to =
continue the retraction of the P6-2B solar array, work that got off to a go=
od start before and during a spacewalk Wednesday.

Astronauts Jim Reilly and Danny Olivas also will review plans for a spacewa=
lk Friday and practice techniques for repairing a pulled-up insulation blan=
ket on the shuttle's left-side Orbital Maneuvering System rocket pod.

Olivas will carry out the actual repair, anchored to the end of the shuttle=
's 50-foot-long robot arm. He plans to push the 4-inch by 6-inch blanket co=
rner down and then use a surgical stapler to secure it to adjacent blankets=
. Both spacewalkers have time built into their schedule for additional sola=
r array retraction work if necessary. A fourth spacewalk by Pat Forrester a=
nd Steve Swanson is scheduled for Sunday.

The P6 solar array was installed on the station in December 2000 to provide=
 electrical power to U.S. systems during the early stages of assembly. Now =
that NASA is activating the station's permanent power system, P6 must be mo=
ved to the left end of the lab's solar truss.

That move is planned for later this year but first, the two 115-foot dual-b=
lanket solar wings making up the P6 array must be retracted. One wing was s=
towed during a shuttle flight last December, but the astronauts ran into ma=
jor problems and had to stage an unplanned spacewalk to coax the blankets b=
ack into their storage boxes.

Building on lessons learned, the Atlantis astronauts began the retraction o=
f the other side of the P6 array Wednesday using a slow, step-by-step appro=
ach to prevent the blind-like blankets from folding the wrong way or otherw=
ise hanging up as their framework mast is pulled in.

Before Wednesday's spacewalk, the astronauts were able to retract the centr=
al mast some 28 feet before standing down for the EVA. Then, Forrester and =
Swanson, using custom insulated tools, freed blanket grommets from guidewir=
es and helped ensure smooth folding, allowing the mast to be retracted anot=
her five bays or so for a total of about 45 feet.

Working inside the space station, the astronauts plan to carry out more bay=
-by-bay retraction attempts today. If any blankets hang up, the crew can re=
-extend the mast or jog it from side to side using motors that normally hel=
p the panels track the sun. Several so-called "wiggle" tests Wednesday set =
up enough rippling motion in the flexible blankets to free slats that had h=
ung up on guide wires. The astronauts are hoping for more of the same today.

Here is a timeline of today's activity (in EDT and mission elapsed time; in=
cludes rev. H of the NASA TV schedule):

Depending on how far the crew gets today, the flight plan includes time for=
 additional retraction work Friday, when Olivas and Reilly stage the crew's=
 third spacewalk.

Atlantis is scheduled to undock from the space station next Tuesday around =
10:40 a.m. But the Russian computer system must be operational before the s=
huttle departs. Protecting their options, NASA managers today asked the ast=
ronauts to implement power conservation measures to permit a possible addit=
ional docked day if necessary.

As of 10:25 a.m., the station's power system had been successfully reconfig=
ured after Russian engineers re-established communications and the ability =
to command one computer in the guidance system and one in the command-and-c=
ontrol system. Engineers were hopeful about restoring two other systems to =
operation. But it's not yet clear what triggered the original problem and t=
roubleshooting continues.
