You know, that's a benefit I hadn't even considered. Documentation
*should* come up early! Thanks for pointing it out. ;-)

Which means that the user has to understand Perl's statement syntax and
semantics, in order to write Pod. And the user also has to understand
that in order to even read Pod.

Not FUD...just an partial enumeration of the full recursive complexity
of the "simple rule" regarding "is expecting a new statement".

I hope I'm not that shallow. I would like to think I have enough experience 
with both design and teaching not to fall prey to that--admittedly common--
mistake. I'm heartened by the fact that several other contributors to
this debate have agreed with me, but I certainly do have to acknowledge
the possibility that you (as an excellent and experienced teacher) are
right. Nevertheless I still believe that the new model, because it has
no exceptions or context dependency, will actually be much easier to
understand and to explain.

Sure. When the "certain column" was column 6! Surely you're not arguing
that:

     "A = in the first column introduces some documentation"

is as hard to understand (or even just identify) as:

     "A non-blank/non-zero in column 6 continues the previous line"

???

Perceptually and cognitively, the first column is both highly
distinctive and easily identified. For example, in my experience
teaching Fortran (back in the mid-80s), students had no problem
whatsoever learning that "A 'C' in the first column is a comment".

I assure you that that is categorically *not* the case (as I'll discuss
at length in a subsequent message).
