I did this backwards, it prints on success, but you get the idea. BTW,
the return won't work unless this code is within a subroutine. Even
though it spits an error because of this, you can see that both
statements get processed:

#!/usr/bin/perl -w

use strict;
use Net::FTP;

my $remote_host = 'localhost';

my $ftp = Net::FTP->new ($remote_host);

if ($ftp) {
        print "Connected to $remote_host\n";
        return(1);
}


...returns this:

%./ftptest.pl
Connected to localhost
Can't return outside a subroutine at ./ftptest.pl line 12.
