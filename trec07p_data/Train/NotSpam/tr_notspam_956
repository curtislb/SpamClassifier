Hi,

(Sorry if this is a dup - I tried to post this a while ago, but it 
didn't seem to make it to the list - so I'm trying again...)

I was just investigating why MySQL Query Analyzer's Help/Contents does
not work and digging around for relevant bugs.  It seems that this part
is effectively the MySQL Reference Manual in some form and was until
Sarge distributed in non-free and part of package mysql-nonfree.  Is
that right?

Anyway according to bug #308680 this package was removed because the 
manual was at the time undistributable.

However according to the MySQL website the license for the Reference
manual now contains the following ...

"You shall not publish or distribute this documentation in any form or
on any media, except if you distribute the documentation in a manner
similar to how MySQL disseminates it (that is, electronically for
download on a Web site with the software) or on a CD-ROM or similar
medium, provided however that the documentation is disseminated together
with the software on the same medium"

My interpretation is that it would now be OK to resurrect mysql-nonfree.
Which would be useful to me as I'm still learning the in and outs of
MySQL's SQL syntax and it's a bit of a pain to have to keep searching on
the online version :-)

Is there any interest in resurrecting this package?

Cheers,

    David.
