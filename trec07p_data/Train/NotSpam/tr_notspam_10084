you ignore what i wrote. im glad if you stay and keep on ask important questions
but please recognise that there are some core decisions that define the language
called perl, and when we change them its no longer perl. so please dont feel offended
to me its a matter of logic and practibality. 

and to me it maybe sometime usefull dont write as much ";" but keep out sigils
i definitly dont like because it became much harder readable to me and the whole
subject of twigils and siginiture sigils goes down the toilet whenn we throw that
one away.

so i hope you understand me now better
all best
herbert
