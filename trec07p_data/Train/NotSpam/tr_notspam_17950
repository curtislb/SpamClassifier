8:34 PM, 6/9/07, Update: Shannon pleased with tank performance; engineers c=
ontinue blanket assessment=20

The Atlantis astronauts late today used the shuttle's robot arm and a power=
ful camera on the end of a heat-shield inspection boom to take a close-up l=
ook at a pulled up insulation blanket on one of the ship's aft rocket pods.

The astronauts noticed the protruding blanket on the left-side Orbital Mane=
uvering System rocket pod during a routine post-launch inspection late Frid=
ay. John Shannon, chairman of NASA's Mission Management Team, said late tod=
ay "there's not a great deal of concern over it right now, but there's a lo=
t of work to be done and we'll do that in the coming days."

A preliminary assessment of ground video and imagery from Atlantis indicate=
s the ship's repaired external fuel tank performed well during the climb to=
 space, with only minor instances of foam shedding and nothing apparent abo=
ve NASA's critical threshold for causing damage to the shuttle's heat shiel=
d.

"As you remember, there was a lot of concern pre-flight when we had the hai=
l storm in February and it put well over 2,000 divots in the upper part of =
the tank," Shannon told reporters. "The crew was able to image that very we=
ll after the orbiter separated from the tank. The external tank team is loo=
king at that very closely, but from what we can tell so far, we did not los=
e any of the repairs, everything looked exactly like it should look, it loo=
ks like everything stayed in place."

The only obvious bit of foam loss occurred near a 17-inch-wide liquid oxyge=
n feed line near the top of the tank's hydrogen section.

"We saw a little 6-inch by 3-inch divot by that big feed line that takes ox=
ygen to the main engines," Shannon said. "That is very similar to foam loss=
es we've seen in previous flights. We expect that it will give us some data=
 on the mechanics of why the foam comes off in that area and we can work on=
 improvements in future tanks. This is not any kind of a threat to the vehi=
cle at all, it's just good engineering data."

Analysis of data from C-band and KU-band radars near the launch pad is on-g=
oing as is an assessment of data from impact sensors mounted behind the rei=
nforced carbon carbon panels making up the leading edges of Atlantis' wings=
. Camera mounted in the shuttle's twin booster rockets will be recovered an=
d assessed after the spent casings are towed back to Port Canaveral on Sund=
ay.

Shannon said those camera may have captured the moment the foam separated f=
rom near the feedline and they may show whether a paper rocket nozzle cover=
 or any other sort of debris hit the protruding insulation blanket on the l=
eft OMS pod. The blanket was installed in January and engineers think it mo=
re likely that a corner simply pulled away in the airflow.

Video from the space shuttle's robot arm early today showed a 4-inch-by 6-i=
nch triangular section of the blanket separated from where it butted up aga=
inst a section of white heat-shield tiles. Close-up pictures later today pr=
ovided a clearer image, showing the 2-inch-thick blanket intact but folded =
back in one corner.

"There's an area on the OMS pod that (is protected by) tile, it has more ae=
rodynamic forces on it, a little bit more heating, then that transitions in=
 a lower-heating area to the blankets and at that transition point, it look=
s like one corner of one of those thick blankets pulled up a little bit," S=
hannon said. "It looks like some of the stitching ripped and a corner of th=
at peeled up."

Engineers are assessing the blanket to determine what, if anything, might n=
eed to be done. On the first shuttle flight in 1981, several tiles on each =
of Columbia's OMS pods were cracked or missing, but no problems were seen a=
fter landing. LIkewise, a blanket lost during another early shuttle flight =
caused no problems.

But in the post-Columbia world, NASA takes no chances and Shannon said the =
protruding blanket seen on Atlantis' port OMS pod will get a thorough engin=
eering analysis to make sure it doesn't pose a threat to the ship or its cr=
ew.

"We have flight history of damage to these OMS pods," Shannon said. "Early =
in the program, STS-1, we lost some tile material, STS-6, we lost at least =
one blanket in that area. And for all of those, we do not believe we had an=
y damage at all to the OMS pods.

Even so, he said. "we're going to go and characterize it and go through our=
 analysis. Every flight, I feel like I'm a broken record. I come in and say=
 'there's this thing, it doesn't look like a big deal, we're going go do ou=
r assessment and see how it turns out.' We'll do the exact same thing on th=
is flight."

The Atlantis astronauts already plan to carry out three spacewalks, Monday,=
 Wednesday and Friday, to connect and activate a new space station solar ar=
ray, retract another solar panel so it can be moved later and perform a var=
iety of other assembly tasks.

Shannon said if necessary, the astronauts could work on the protruding blan=
ket, possibly tucking the material back in and pinning it down or even usin=
g a viscous, heat-resistant tile-repair material to fill in the exposed und=
erlying area."

But nothing like that will be planned until engineers complete their assess=
ment of the damage and the likely effects of re-entry aerodynamics and heat=
ing on surrounding blankets and the underlying structure of the rocket pod.

The Atlantis astronauts, meanwhile, are continuing to close in on the inter=
national space station, on track for docking Sunday afternoon. During final=
 approach, the station astronauts will photograph the shuttle's belly to lo=
ok for any signs of impact damage, a routine part of post-Columbia rendezvo=
us procedures.

For readers interested in looking ahead, a detailed rendezvous timeline is =
posted on the STS-117 Quick-Look page. A docking preview will be posted ear=
ly Sunday.
