Hi Kern,

Bacula doesn't accompany OpenSSL when you distribute it, but they certainly
do accompany one another when we distribute them both as part of the Debian
OS.  This is a plain English meaning of "accompany".

I have seen various FSF FAQs over the years that have claimed that
distributing binaries linked against OpenSSL is ok, but these FAQs have been
mute on the matter of distribution as part of an OS.  In recent times, it
appears that some Unix vendors such as Sun and Apple have also begun
distributing GNU software as part of systems whose cores are not licensed
compatibly with the GPL, with the FSF's tacit consent; that seems
ill-advised to me, but in any case the FSF's interpretations of the GPL
aren't binding on other copyright holders where those interpretations don't
follow logically from the text of the license.

Ah, well, that right there is sufficient for us to use as a license
exception grant. :)  But of course it's not binding on other copyright
holders.

Not much of one, I fear...

To be clear here, it's not incompatible with the GPL for you to grant
additional linking permissions, which is what is being done.  The only real
issue is that you can't grant such permission on behalf of other copyright
holders.
