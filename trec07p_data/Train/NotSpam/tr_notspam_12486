 Live from Afghanistan - Helmet Cam Captures Rump Shot Heard Round the World 

 While the U.S. attempts to keep GIs from blogging and posting video, not everyone has that restriction.  Witness this hot-off-the-presses video, made with footage captured by a webcam mounted on one British Royal Marine's helmet!  This video takes you with this Royal Marine as he patrols in Afghanistan, become involved in a skirmish, and gets shot (fortunately, in the backside, and he's relatively fine).  There is no real gore in this video, but there is gunfire, and a lot of swearing.
