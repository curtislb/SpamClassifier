						Today's Quote for the Day:
<br>

<br>
"Raising children is like being taken hostage by midget terrorists" -  Ben =
Elton.
<br>

<br>
In tonight's programme:
<br>

<br>
<b>IRAN</b>
<br>

<br>
Iran seems set to be the big story of 2007. We're pursuing two strands toni=
ght: who precisely decided what could be said by the Royal Navy personnel h=
eld by the Iranian regime? Is anyone likely to carry the can for the public=
 relations fiasco?=20
<br>

<br>
And - perhaps much more significant in the long run - given Iran's boast th=
at it is now capable of industrial production of nuclear fuel, is it time t=
o admit that the European strategy of engagement with the Islamic regime ha=
s failed? And if so - is there a Plan B?
<br>

<br>
<B>PAEDOPHILES </B>
<br>

<br>
I confess that despite reading and listening to commentaries about how the =
new pilot scheme on providing information on paedophiles is supposed to wor=
k, I am personally none the wiser.=20
<br>

<br>
Perhaps enlightenment will set in by 10.30pm, but it is also possible that =
the scheme is incomprehensible. We'll try to find out.=20
<br>

<br>
<B>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</B>=20
<br>

<br>
The new interim Thai Government, which is struggling with plunging populari=
ty and the task of restoring democracy, has stunned its main trading partne=
r, the US, by declaring war on the big pharmaceutical companies.=20
<br>

<br>
The Health Minister has issued Thailand's first compulsory licences, breaki=
ng the patents on two HIV/AIDS drugs and one heart drug, and is preparing t=
o do the same with several other durgs in order to cut the country's health=
care costs. Will they get away with it?
<br>

<br>
<B>YOUTUBE</B>
<br>

<br>
Websites such as YouTube have come under fire today for not doing enough to=
 discourage cyber-bullies. In tonight's programme, we'll attempt to redress=
 some of the negative press new technology has been getting.=20
<br>

<br>
We'll look at some of the creative efforts the technology has been unleashi=
ng, and the increasing craze on sites such as YouTube for posting re-enactm=
ents of famous scenes from films.
<br>

<br>
<B>AND FINALLY </B>
<br>

<br>
I'm indebted - I think that is the correct word - to Peter Walker for this =
Easter Joke Fit for an Eleven Year Old:=20
<br>

<br>
...what do you get if you throw boiling water down a rabbit hole...?
<br>

<br>
...you get a hot cross bunny...!
<br>

<br>
Newsnight is at 10.30pm on BBC2.
