Maybe you don't have the header files for compiling?  In any event
grid is only installed (see below)

Not exactly. 

'r-base' depends on r-base-core, r-recommended and many other things.
You have the option of only installing r-base-core, but if you start
with r-base, things just work. [1]

Moreover, the r-base-core package _contains_ grid:

	 edd@basebud:~> dpkg -L r-base-core | grep grid | wc -l
	 197

So to make it as plain as possible:

   i)  what is in R-$VERSION/src/library/ goes into r-base-core
   
   ii) with the exception of R-$VERSION/src/library/Recommended
       where each packages goes into its own r-cran-$package as
       eg r-cran-boot, r-cran-cluster, ...

In any event, r-cran-tseries has been available for years so wgar
Deepankar wants here

	  $ sudo apt-get install r-cran-tseries

Dirk

[1] The most common gotcha is that people forget the other meta
package r-base-dev that Spie created years ago -- you need it to
ensure the appropriate -dev packages are installed too.
