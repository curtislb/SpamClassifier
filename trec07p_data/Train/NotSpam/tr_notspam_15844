snip

perl -le 'print "$_ is ", int -M, " days old" for @ARGV' /etc/passwd
/etc/passwd is 25 days old

"-M $foo" is shorthand for "$^T - (stat($foo))[9]".  $^T is a special
variable that starts with the time the interpreter started (but it can
be changed) and (stat($foo))[9] is the modification time of the file.

from perldoc perlvar
        $^T     The time at which the program began running, in seconds since
               the epoch (beginning of 1970).  The values returned by the -M,
               -A, and -C filetests are based on this value.

from perldoc -f stat
       stat FILEHANDLE
       stat EXPR
       stat    Returns a 13-element list giving the status info for a file,
               either the file opened via FILEHANDLE, or named by EXPR.  If
               EXPR is omitted, it stats $_.  Returns a null list if the stat
               fails.  Typically used as follows:

                   ($dev,$ino,$mode,$nlink,$uid,$gid,$rdev,$size,
                      $atime,$mtime,$ctime,$blksize,$blocks)
                          = stat($filename);

               Not all fields are supported on all filesystem types.  Here are
               the meanings of the fields:

                 0 dev      device number of filesystem
                 1 ino      inode number
                 2 mode     file mode  (type and permissions)
                 3 nlink    number of (hard) links to the file
                 4 uid      numeric user ID of file's owner
                 5 gid      numeric group ID of file's owner
                 6 rdev     the device identifier (special files only)
                 7 size     total size of file, in bytes
                 8 atime    last access time in seconds since the epoch
                 9 mtime    last modify time in seconds since the epoch
                10 ctime    inode change time in seconds since the epoch (*)
                11 blksize  preferred block size for file system I/O
                12 blocks   actual number of blocks allocated

               (The epoch was at 00:00 January 1, 1970 GMT.)

Hope that helps.
