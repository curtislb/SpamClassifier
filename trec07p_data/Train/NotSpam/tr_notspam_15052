Well, you'll have to plug only one computer into the switch, and configure
it for dhcp, and then plug the cable modem in ... This should work, as the
switch will simply act as a network fabric at that point.

Obviously plugging in multiple computers will not work so well, because then
the cable modem might start switching to another machine, or bad things
might happen, but you can simply then run a DHCP server on the machine that
is getting the address from the cable modem, and go to town distributing
addresses internally.

Actually, another approach is to simply get another nic card for your
computer, and do it at that level.

Take care,
Sina

I'm sure they must've thought of a way to assign an IP address. For those of
us who made the mistake of getting a switch instead of a router, there is no
way to get the DHCP address the cable, DSL, or other connection provides
unless you can from a web page in the modem.
