Yeah tried before and I was disgusted, but I will try to give it another
go and see if it has improved, I tried it very early.

Yeah I was _suprised_ I really had all trees when it took less than a
minut for me, I thought there was only the indexes, then when I did the
checkout and it appeared in no time, I realized it was _very_ fast.

The only problem I see with git/bzr as the main tree is that it seem to
introduce a gatekeeper to the "official" tree forcing all people to send
around patches instead of just committing.
This work flow model is ok if a few people work on a very isolated part
of a tree, or on some experimental features, but if you need to
collaborate it may make things more annoying.

Simo.
