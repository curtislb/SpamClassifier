Political Hot Topics
(Today's top political stories from news organizations across the country)

"THE IMPACT IS FELT IN EVERY CLASSROOM": President Bush said Monday that the mass shooting at Virginia Tech, the
deadliest campus shooting ever in this country, affects every student across the nation. "Schools should be places of
safety, sanctuary and learning," Bush said in reaction to the deaths of more than 30 people on the campus. "When that
sanctuary is violated, the impact is felt in every American classroom in every American community." Bush spoke with
Gov. Timothy M. Kaine and Virginia Tech President Charles Steger. "I told them that Laura and I and many across our
nation are praying for the victims and all the members of university community that have been devastated by this
terrible tragedy," Bush said in the Diplomatic Room of the White House. AP via Yahoo! News: Bush says shootings affect
all students http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070417/ap_on_go_pr_wh/bush_virginia_tech

INCIDENT REVIVES GUN CONTROL DEBATE: Monday's deadly rampage at Virginia Tech sparked a largely one-sided response in
the long-running debate over guns. Gun control advocates said the shootings pointed to the need for tougher laws, while
supporters of gun rights generally kept their heads down. And leaders of both major political parties expressed
sympathy for victims and their families, while avoiding comment on gun control. In brief remarks from the White House,
President Bush expressed the nation's grief over the carnage in Blacksburg, Va... Bush, a longtime champion of the
right to bear arms, said nothing about the gun control debate. Similarly, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada
and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco expressed sorrow about the shootings but remained silent on gun
control. Los Angeles Times: Gun control debate resumes, on one side
http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-gunlaw17apr17,1,2333005.story

A "RADIOACTIVE" ISSUE FOR DEMS: Democrats have grown very reluctant to talk about gun control. It has become a
radioactive issue. And a Republican who once was an ardent supporter of it, Rudy Giuliani, now says he supports the
right of individuals to bear arms and that the states not the federal government should decide how to control guns.
After Gore's defeat, Terry McAuliffe, then chairman of the Democratic Party, was vocal in advising Democrats to abandon
gun control as an issue in future elections. "I believe we ought to move it out, let the individual communities decide
their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated," he said. "It has had a devastating impact on elections because the
NRA has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members' views and Al Gore's views." The Politico:
Shootings Echo Across Decades Without Gun Control Solutions http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0407/3533.html

"CHILLING EFFECT" ON CAMPAIGNS: The chilling effect of the Virginia Tech shootings reverberated yesterday from the
late-night comics to presidential hopefuls. Jay Leno led into his "Tonight" show monologue with what sounded almost
like an apology for doing jokes after the worst shooting massacre in U.S. history. "Our job has always been to kind of
end your day, get a few laughs, so that is what we will try to do," Leno said. "I just want to be respectful. We will
do some jokes, we will be silly. But we just want - we don't want to forget what happened today." Clearly wary of
offending voters, several presidential candidates hurriedly canceled plans to campaign today out of respect for the
Virginia Tech shooting victims. New York Daily News: Campaigns - and comics - feel chill

HOUSE, SENATE NEGOTIATORS HAMMER OUT DETAILS ON SPENDING BILL: Congress and the White House will move this week toward
a final showdown over a contested war funding bill, with most Americans trusting Democrats over President Bush to set
Iraq policy but with sentiment deeply divided over Congress's push to set a deadline for withdrawing U.S. forces.
Democratic leaders will formally convene House and Senate negotiators tomorrow to hammer out a final version of the
bill, hoping to have the compromise on Bush's desk by the end of next week. The president and Democratic leaders again
exchanged verbal fire yesterday. Bush used a backdrop of military families to declare: "We should not legislate defeat
in this vital war." Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), flanked by retired Army generals, fired back: "The
president and the vice president continue to desperately cling to their failed escalation strategy and attack those who
disagree with them." Washington Post: Final War Funding Bill in Works
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/16/AR2007041601099.html

SENATORS TO HOLD HEARING ON EAVESDROPPING BILL: FBI agents and other federal investigators would have greater leeway to
eavesdrop on foreigners in the USA suspected of having information on terrorism or national security threats, under a
Bush administration proposal. The bill has the backing of the Justice Department and Director of National Intelligence
Mike McConnell. It would allow the telephone calls, e-mails and other activities of persons who are not U.S. citizens
or legal residents to be secretly monitored if they are thought to "possess significant foreign intelligence
information." Individuals and groups who deal in "weapons of mass destruction" would also become surveillance targets,
under the proposed law. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act requires that a surveillance target be an agent of a
foreign power or connected to a terrorist group before a secret FISA court authorizes monitoring. The proposed law, a
copy of which was furnished to USA TODAY by McConnell's office, would amend that requirement. USA Today: Surveillance
bill gets Hill hearing http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-04-16-FISA_N.htm

DOCS SAY NJ GOV "RECOVERING BETTER THAN THEY HAD EXPECTED": Surgeons operated on Gov. Jon Corzine yesterday for the
third time since he was critically injured in a Parkway crash, and said he might soon eat, talk and breathe on his own.
In their most detailed explanation yet of Corzine's condition, Cooper University Hospital doctors said the governor was
recovering better than they had expected and that they hoped to begin weaning him off medication that has left him
barely conscious since Thursday. But they cautioned that the extensive injuries to his leg, chest and back made any
predictions dicey. "I don't say patients are out of the woods until they leave the hospital," said Steven Ross, head of
the hospital's trauma unit. "He's certainly not out of the woods yet." Newark Star-Ledger: MDs say Corzine healing
better than they expected http://www.nj.com/news/ledger/index.ssf?/base/news-11/1176786570251210.xml&coll=1

DEMS HAVE NEARLY TWICE AS MANY DONORS: From Congress to the presidential campaign, Republican fundraising is lagging
while Democratic donations are surging. Yet beneath the record-breaking million-dollar totals lies another statistic
that could be more ominous in 2008 for Republicans: a yawning gap between the presidential primary fields' donor bases.
According to campaign figures, the Democrats' top three candidates received donations from about 204,000 individuals.
The first-tier Republican trio drew checks from 110,000, roughly half as many. That donor disparity helped give the
Democrats a big first-quarter financial advantage. The Democrats' top three candidates reported having $61 million in
cash at the end of the quarter, compared with $29 million posted by the top Republicans. Of the nine presidential
hopefuls who raised more than $1 million, six are Democrats, compared with three Republicans. The Politico: GOP Funk:
Top Dems Have Twice As Many Donors http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0407/3538.html

Q1 NUMBERS CONTRADICT PREVIOUS ASSUMPTIONS: The first-quarter fundraising reports from the 2008 presidential campaign
crystallized two realities of this intensely fought election: The battle for each party's nomination is more open than
it was just three months ago, and each contest pits three relatively well-funded candidates against one another, with
the rest of the field at a disadvantage. Two common assumptions proved false: that Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (N.Y.),
with the most extensive money network in Democratic politics, would blow away her rivals in first-quarter fundraising,
and that Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), who had spent the previous two years preparing for this campaign, would easily best
his Republican rivals. Instead, Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) stunned political observers by raising more money for the
primudles than Clinton, and McCain's anemic fundraising and rapid spending left the onetime front-runner on the
defensive. Washington Post: Fundraising Totals Challenge Early Campaign Assumptions
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/16/AR2007041601705.html

WHO'S THE KING OF WALL STREET? Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama ran ahead of New York Senator Hillary
Clinton and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani on their home turf, raising cash from the biggest investment banks on
Wall Street. Obama raised $479,209 from employees at the banks in the first quarter, according to Federal Election
Commission filings. That was better than Giuliani, a Republican who collected $473,442. Clinton, Obama's Democratic
rival, raised $447,625. The figures are based on employers listed by donors; in some cases, the names are missing or
incomplete.  The employees of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS AG gave Obama more than a combined $260,000, boosting
his showing. The Illinois senator's top fundraisers include David Heller, a managing director at Goldman, and Robert
Wolf, chief executive officer of UBS Americas. Bloomberg: Obama Gets Edge on New Yorkers Clinton, Giuliani on Wall
Street http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=washingtonstory&sid=aLeZ7ht_LtZg

HOW THEY ARE SPENDING: [E]ach campaign doled out its contributions differently, often in unexpected ways that provide
some insights into the candidates. Mitt Romney, the Republican, who is by far the richest candidate, was stingiest with
his staff members' salaries, often having them fly discount airlines and stay in accommodations as humble as a Super 8
Motel in Parsippany, N.J. Senator John McCain of Arizona, whose Republican primary campaign spent the highest
percentage of income during the quarter, paid nearly $11,000 for photography, $1,700 for decorations and $1,671 for
flowers. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, who irked donors during her last Senate campaign by running up
heavy bills for such amenities, spent just $205 for photographs and $89 for flowers, according to the campaign's
filings. But her campaign did report a debt of $1,995 to Jack H. Lucky Floral Design in New Market, Va. New York Times:

EDWARDS GETS A $400 HAIRCUT: Democratic White House hopeful John Edwards insists on first-class pampering - enjoying
$400 haircuts on the road and plunking down nearly $500 for swank spa treatments, according to campaign records.
Edwards, who touts himself as the poor man's champion and even launched his bid from New Orleans' hurricane-devastated
Lower Ninth Ward, tucked the vanity treatments into his 5,236-page first-quarter Federal Election Commission filing
under "consulting" expenses. Records show he doled out $400 of his contributors' money to Beverly Hills mane maestros
at Torrenueva Hair Designs in February and another $400 to Torrenueva in early March. New York Post: JOHN'S $400 TRIM

HEF'S ON THE HIL BANDWAGON: Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) is seeking to become the first woman president, and a
man who has published countless pictures of naked women is pitching in for her White House bid. Hugh Hefner, the
founder of the Playboy Enterprises empire, is among the many celebrities who have picked their favorite candidate to
succeed President Bush in 2009.  Hefner contributed $2,300 (the maximum allowed in the primary) to Clinton's campaign
on March 28, identifying his occupation on the fundraiser form as "editor-in-chief" of Playboy magazine. The Hill: Hugh
Hefner gives $2,300 to Clinton's '08 campaign

McCAIN CALLS FOR "GREATER FISCAL RESTRAINT": Senator John McCain of Arizona acknowledged Monday that his fellow
Republicans "forgot who we were" in recent years by spending too much, and said that as president he would rely on low
taxes, greater fiscal restraint and free trade to lift the nation's economy. Mr. McCain, whose presidential campaign
has been viewed with suspicion by some conservatives because of his initial opposition to the Bush administration's tax
cuts, used the first major economic address of his campaign to reaffirm his commitment to the free market but said he
would move to overhaul the nation's unemployment programs to help people find jobs in the new economy. And he had some
strong words for the way his fellow Republicans governed when they controlled Congress. New York Times: McCain Says
Fellow Republicans Spent Too Much While Running Congress http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/17/us/politics/17mccain.html

OBAMAS EARNED $991K IN '06: The annual income for Illinois Sen. Barack Obama and his wife dropped about $680,000 in
2006 from the nearly $1.7 million they took in the prior year, according to documents released Monday. Information
released by the Chicago Democrat's presidential campaign indicated that the Obamas' total income decreased because in
2005 they had a major book deal and a one-time bonus. Their 2006 income of $991,296 included Obama's salary of $157,082
and his wife's administrator's pay of $273,618 from the University of Chicago Hospitals and $51,200 in director fees
from a food distributor, TreeHouse Inc. AP via Yahoo! News: Obamas' 2006 income put at $991,296

CLINTON NO LONGER "VERY MUCH RIGHT" ON "VILLAGE," SAYS ROMNEY: Presidential hopeful Mitt Romney says that Sen. Hillary
Rodham Clinton is wrong when she contends that "it takes a village" to raise a child, though he told a newspaper in
1998 that Clinton was "very much right."... During a speech to New Hampshire Republicans last weekend in which he
touted the need for strong American families, the former Massachusetts governor said, "I think it's time for us to
recognize every child deserves a mother and a father." Asked by The Associated Press after the speech if he disagreed
with Clinton's view, expressed in her 1996 book "It Takes a Village," that raising children requires a community-wide
effort, Romney said he disagreed and added, "It takes a family." However, in 1998, Romney told The Boston Globe:
"Hillary Clinton is very much right, it does take a village, and we are a village and we need to work together in a
non-skeptical, no-finger-pointing way." AP via Yahoo! News: Romney changes view on 'village' comment
