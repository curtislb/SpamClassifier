Package: esniper
Severity: serious
Justification: Policy 2.2.3

[Cc:d to debian-legal]

Hi,

It's not obvious it is legal to distribute this software at all
(probably it either is fit for main or unfit for non-free too). I
suggest a review on debian-legal, since I'm not well versed in (at
least this area of) law. I found nothing about this in debian-legal
archives, so I assume it has not been discussed.

2.2.3 says "Packages must be placed in _non-free_ if they are not
compliant with the DFSG or are encumbered by patents or other legal
issues that make their distribution problematic." (I expected to find
something saying something about software that cannot be distributed
at all, but apparently it's not there, and all the language in other
sections seems very copyright and patent centric.)

eBay TOS (or "User Agreement" in eBay terms) says[1]:

Additionally, you agree that you will not:
