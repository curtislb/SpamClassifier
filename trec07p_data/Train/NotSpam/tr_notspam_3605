						<b>CASH FOR HONOURS</b>
<br>
=20
<br>
Just before 3pm this afternoon, the Cash for Honours story moved into a new=
 realm. The Metropolitan Police announced they have handed a 216 page long =
file of evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service.=20=20
<br>

<br>
After an inquiry that lasted more than a year, during which time 136 people=
 were interviewed, we now await the CPS's judgement on whether charges will=
 be brought and against whom.  With elections in the coming weeks - and the=
 impending departure of Tony Blair - the timing of any prosecution could ha=
ve significant consequences.  Michael Crick will be making his assessment.
<br>
=20
<br>
<b>FRENCH ELECTION</b>
<br>

<br>
The French presidential elections are shaping up into a classic Right/Left =
battle between the two leading candidates, the former Interior Minister Nic=
olas Sarkozy and the socialist Segolene Royal.=20
<br>

<br>
After a campaign in which the two of them criticised each other for talking=
 about themselves, the voters have two polling rounds to decide which (and =
it could just be a matter of degrees) is better equipped to pull the countr=
y out of the economic and cultural doldrums.=20=20
<br>

<br>
The first round campaign concludes as we're on air this evening with pollin=
g on Sunday. Allan Little is in Paris and we'll host a debate between proxi=
es for Sarkosy and Royal here in the studio.
<br>
=20
<br>
<b>WELSH ELECTIONS</b>
<br>
=20=20
<br>
And looking ahead to elections here - Michael Crick has been noseying about=
 the Welsh valleys to find out just how much pressure Labour is under in on=
e of their heartlands.

					And then it's snap, crack and some pop with my guests on Review Paul M=
orley, John Harris, Julie Myerson and Sam Tanenhaus.
<br>
=20
<br>
<b>HALF NELSON</b>=20
<br>

<br>
Half Nelson is the small indy film that has already made a big splash on th=
e festival circuit garnering numerous prizes and plaudits for direction and=
 topping it all off with a Best Actor Oscar nomination for Ryan Gosling, wh=
o plays a well worn Hollywood role, an inspirational teacher BUT with a big=
 difference.
<br>

<br>
This history teacher, Dan, is a crackhead. Working in a poor Brooklyn schoo=
l he is befriended by a 13 year old student Drey played by Shareeka Epps, w=
ho has many troubles of her own, but who after discovering him flat out in =
the school lavatory with a crack pipe tries to look out for him - and vice =
versa.=20
<br>

<br>
It's the feature debut of Ryan Fleck, and the film is suffused with a polit=
ical consciousness that threatens to become too obvious at times but is sav=
ed by their performances. The soundtrack by Broken Social Scene is outstand=
ing.=20
<br>

<br>
<b>MAXWELL</b>=20
<br>

<br>
Captain Bob the great big fraudster aka media tycoon Robert Maxwell died 16=
 years ago, when his body was found floating in the Atlantic. David Suchet =
plays the charismatic monster in his final months when his whole shaky busi=
ness empire was crashing down around his ears and, it emerged after his dea=
th - he'd emptied the coffers of several of his companies and most notoriou=
sly the Mirror Group pension fund.=20
<br>

<br>
This 90 minute BBC film is the latest to tap into our fascination for drama=
s about real figures - swiftly following on from those on Blair, Blunkett a=
nd Prescott. Maxwell was penned by Craig Warner who also wrote the BAFTA no=
minated The Queen's Sister and features real life characters such as Betty,=
 Maxwell's wife, played by Patricia Hodge as well as some composite minor o=
nes.=20
<br>

<br>
<b>ARCTIC MONKEYS</b>=20
<br>

<br>
Arctic Monkeys new album Favourite Worse Nightmare is out next week. Their =
first turned them into the biggest band in Britain - but this one may make =
them the most loved. The lyrics are more thoughtful, every song has a diffe=
rent character and the guitars just sound great.=20
<br>

<br>
<b>COMPACT EDITIONS</b>=20
<br>

<br>
Great classics in half the time. That's the big sell behind Orion Publishin=
g's editions of six classic novels each cut to less than 400 pages, more su=
ited to the busy lives we lead, they claim. Among this batch are Moby Dick =
and Anna Karenina - a bit like two minute Shakespeare? What will Review's p=
anel of busy people think?=20
<br>

<br>
Do watch to find out.=20
