Do you know whether this third drive has been partitioned and
formatted?  Are the jumpers on this drive set for master or slave?
Generally, each IDE controller can handle two devices--one master and
one slave.  This means that with two IDE controllers (sometimes
supplied directly on a mother board), you can have up to four IDE
devices in one system--as long as the power supply can handle them
without overloading and burning out.  Here on my Slackware 11.0
systems, the IDE drives are listed under /proc/ide as 'hd?@', where
the question mark is 'a' or 'c' to designate either drive 'hda' or
'hdc', and the trailing at sign (@) indicates that these are pointers
to the actual directories where the drive info can be found.  If your
newly installed IDE drive is not listed in /proc/ide, then you might
need to change a jumper on the drive to change it to master or slave
so that the system will see it.  Once the drive is found by the
system, you will need to partition it with something like fdisk, and
put a file system on it with mkfs or one of the more specialized
programs like mke2fs.  A little more info about your system (how many
IDE cables do you have, which version of Linux are you working with,
etc.) might be helpful if fiddling with jumpers does not solve the
problem.

HTH, and have a great day.
