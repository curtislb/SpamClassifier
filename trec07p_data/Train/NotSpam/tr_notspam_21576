						<div class=3D"GreyHeading">STEVE PARRISH ON THE BRITISH MOTOGP</div>
						<div>Casey Stoner goes into the British MotoGP at Donington Park with=
 a lead of 14 points over the legendary Valentino Rossi.
<br>

<br>
Rossi is chasing his eighth career victory at the Leicestershire track, but=
 that won't faze Stoner.
<br>

<br>
Despite being only 21 years old, the Australian from Kurri Kurri in New Sou=
th Wales is showing the MotoGP world that he is made of stern stuff.
<br>

<br>
He proved beyond any doubt in the last race in Catalunya that he is a prope=
r threat to Rossi.
<br>

<br>
The Italian has been known to screw with people's heads in a bid to unsettl=
e them, but Stoner seems to be well ahead of all that.=20
<br>

<br>
In fact, in terms of psychology, Stoner has got the upper hand after he won=
 that stunning duel in Spain.
<br>

<br>
A couple of the laps during that race were as good as you are ever likely t=
o see in motor racing.=20
<br>

<br>
Stoner told me that it was the first time he really got stuck in and though=
t, "a podium would be nice, but I want to win this one.".=20
<br>

<br>
Rossi calls Donington his second home, but Stoner pointed out that everywhe=
re seems to be his second home and he thinks he says it to try and unnerve =
the other riders.=20
<br>

<br>
What isn't in doubt is the popularity the charismatic Rossi will enjoy from=
 the British crowd and that will be a big boost for him.
<br>

<br>
The track generally produces some good races.=20
<br>

<br>
What I also love about it is how family and spectator friendly it is and th=
ere are some great vantage points to watch the action.=20
<br>

<br>
This is in marked contrast to somewhere like Silverstone which seems very w=
ide open, expansive and a little clinical.=20
<br>

<br>
That takes away a lot of its atmosphere, which is something Donington certa=
inly doesn't lack.=20
<br>

<br>
In fact, the only thing missing for the public on Sunday is a British rider.
<br>

<br>
Enjoy the race,
<br>

<br>
Steve
<br>
