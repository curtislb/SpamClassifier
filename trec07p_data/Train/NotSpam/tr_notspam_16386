Bundespr?sidentin Calmy-Rey verurteilt Synagoge-Brandstiftung

Genf, 3.6.07 (Kipa) Bundespr?sident Micheline Calmy-Rey hat die
Brandstiftung in der Genfer Synagoge Malagnou "auf das Sch?rfste"
verurteilt. Sie habe mit Best?rzung und Besorgnis auf die Verletzung dieser
Kultst?tte reagiert, erkl?rte sie am Samstag, 2. Juni, in einer
Stellungnahme.

Abkl?rungen der Genfer Polizei hatten ergeben, dass der Brand in der
Synagoge mutwillig gelegt worden war. Wie Untersuchungsrichter Michel Graber
am Freitag, 1. Juni, mitteilte, k?nne eine technische Ursache wie auch ein
Zufall ausgeschlossen werden. Man habe in der N?he des Brandherds einen
Zigarettenstummel gefunden. Es gelte nun die DNA-Analyse abzuwarten.
Verd?chtige gibt es Graber zufolge vorerst nicht.

Alfred Donath, der Pr?sident des Schweizerischen Israelitischen
Gemeindebundes, sagte, der Brand habe ihn aufgew?hlt und schockiert.
Schmerzhafte Erinnerungen sei in ihm wachgerufen worden. Ein antisemitischer
Hintergrund lasse sich nicht leugnen, meinte Donath gegen?ber dem
Westschweizer Radio.

Ein Feuer hatte am fr?hen Morgen des 24. Mai die Synagoge Malagnou in der
Stadt Genf weitgehend zerst?rt. Am st?rksten besch?digt wurden die
Bibliothek und der Gebetsraum.

Greece to reclaim stolen artifacts from US museum
June 4, 2007


ATHENS --  Culture minister George Voulgarakis Sunday said that he was
seeking the return of three ancient stolen artifacts to Greece, which are on
display at an Atlanta museum in the United States. 

The Eleftherotypia newspaper reported Sunday that a marble statue dating
back to Hellenic times, a ceramic jar from the 6th century, and a
sarcophagus from the Minoan era had been stolen and sold to the Michael C.
Carlos Museum in Atlanta. 

"These prominent antiques left the country illegally and there is enough
proof to justify their restitution," he said, adding that Greek police and
government authorities had already started the process to get them back. 

According to the paper, the items were sold to the Carlos Museum in 2002 and
2003. 

Voulgarakis reiterated that Athens was seeking the return of all stolen
historical works of art. It has managed to repatriate four key antique
objects from Los Angeles' famed Getty Museum and has asked the Louvre in
Paris to stop displaying a statue loaned from the Cleveland Museum, which it
suspects was stolen. 

The statue dates back to the 4th century BC.

Police release sketches of suspects in artwork theft
  
 
By Angela Rozas
Tribune staff reporter

June 4, 2007, 6:46 PM CDT

Police sketches of suspects who stole a pricey etching from a Michigan
Avenue gallery aren't exactly Rembrandts, but authorities are hoping they
may help lead them to one.

Authorities have released computer-generated drawings of a man and woman
suspected of stealing a nearly 370-year-old Rembrandt etching from a
Magnificent Mile art gallery May 20. Police valued the artwork at $55,000.

The lifelike sketches were made with the assistance of Hilligoss Galleries
employees who saw the man and woman enter the gallery and noticed the
etching was missing moments after they left. The etching, titled "Adam and
Eve," was hanging in a preview room on the gallery's first floor, just steps
away from a receptionist's desk.

Police say they have no new leads in the case but are hoping someone might
recognize the faces in the sketches.

"It would be so great to know art helped us catch these bad guys who stole
art," said Tom Hilligoss, owner of the gallery at 520 N. Michigan Ave.

The man was described as about 55 to 60 years old, 5 feet 9 inches tall, 195
pounds, with gray hair and dark-rimmed glasses. He wore a dark navy golf
jacket and gray dress pants and carried a gray baseball cap. The woman was
said to be 40 to 45 years old, 5 feet 4 inches tall, 125 pounds, with short
blond hair. She wore a tan trench coat.

The couple had apparently been in the gallery several times before, police
said. On the day of the heist, both gallery employees were busy with other
customers when the couple walked in. Hilligoss said Monday he suspects those
other customers might have been in on the scam.

There was only one security camera in the gallery, trained on an elevator on
the street-level entrance to the store. Hilligoss said he is working on
improving security at the gallery.

The etching, which measures 6 by 9 inches but was in a 16-inch-by-14-inch
frame, was made in 1638. It was the oldest piece in the gallery and was on
consignment from an estate. It was insured but not for its asking price,
Hilligoss said.

Jane Avoids Rain, Other Burpee Museum Exhibits Ruined   
 
 
By Smita Kalokhe

Burpee Museum closes it doors temporarily to clean up after storms flood
exhibits. Burpee staff say it could have been worse.

In all, it'll cost between $20,000 and $30,00 to clean up and replace some
of the exhibits. But museum administrators consider themselves lucky since
their prized possession is okay. President Lew Crampton says, "It was not a
bunch of happy campers wandering around here on Saturday."

Heavy rains left 750 gallons of standing water on Burpee Museum's roof. And
it all came pouring in when two drain systems failed. The water rushed
through two holes about six inches in diameter and directly into the Native
American exhibit. Crampton says, "The rugs were very squishy."

Displays in glass cases are okay, but some hands-on works will need to be
replaced. The main concern: Jane. Rockford's favorite dinosaur sits directly
below the Native American collection. "She died in a flood 66 million years
ago, but she survived this one!"

Cleaners drilled holes in walls to make sure mold doesn't build up. There
isn't any structural damage but carpets will need to dry and be cleaned. The
museum could open as early as Friday, but it's already feeling a hit in
revenue. Crampton says, "This is a pretty good season for us. The school
groups are still coming in, but our tourist are starting. We turned away
several groups, several families just this morning."

This isn't the first time the museum experienced water damage. Crampton says
the sprinkler system broke back in 1999. It left 10 feet of standing water
and caused half a million dollars in damages.

Fire damages Old Sturbridge Village farmhouse
Posted by The Republican Newsroom June 04, 2007 20:34PM
By LORI STABILE 
lstabile@repub.com 

STURBRIDGE - A small fire at Old Sturbridge Village's Freeman Farmhouse has
temporarily closed the building, built between 1810 and 1815, according to
officials at the living history museum. 

Sturbridge Fire Capt. John C. Marinelli today said the fire, reported just
after midnight on Sunday, was not suspicious, but caused approximately
$50,000 in damage. Marinelli said fire officials believe a hot ember from
the fireplace, used the day before for a cooking demonstration, spread the
fire in the kitchen. 

The fire broke through the roof, and Old Sturbridge Village security
officers, who were alerted by the fire alarm, responded within four minutes,
followed by Sturbridge firefighters. The security officers used a fire
extinguisher to contain the fire, according to a press release from Old
Sturbridge Village. 

"Our security officers are to be commended. They likely saved the building
from sustaining much more significant damage," Old Sturbridge Village chief
executive officer James Donahue said in a statement. 

"This is a real-life reminder to us that fire was a constant concern to
families in the 1830s. The kitchen fireplace was the hub of the home and
families depended on it for their main source for heat, light and cooking.
As we make repairs, we will examine and upgrade fire safety measures,"
Donahue added. 

Old Sturbridge Village officials stated that it appeared the fire started
inside the paneling and framing surrounding the fireplace and chimney. 

Marinelli said 10 Sturbridge firefighters were on scene, and the Southbridge
Fire Department also assisted. 

Old Sturbridge Village marketing coordinator Pamela S. Lozier said the first
two rooms in the building were not affected by the fire, and will be opened
to visitors as soon as possible. 

"None of our artifacts were actually damaged," Lozier said. 

Repairing the kitchen area may take several weeks, she said. Meanwhile,
cooking demonstrations will be moved to either the Fitch House on the common
or the Townhouse. Freeman Farm, located in the "countryside" area,
previously featured the only cooking demonstrations at the village, which
recreates New England life in the 1830s. 

The Freeman Farmhouse is a 1?-story gambrel-roofed house that was built on a
site two miles from its current location at Old Sturbridge Village. In 1828,
it was home to Delia and Pliny Freeman and their children, and the kitchen
was added shortly after they moved in.

Recuperato un Tiepolo rubato a Roma

PORDENONE (4 giugno) - Un quadro di Gian Domenico Tiepolo, del valore di un
milione di euro, ? stato recuperato dai carabinieri del Comando Provinciale
di Pordenone a Portogruaro (Venezia). Il dipinto, rubato qualche mese fa a
Roma nella casa di un collezionista, era stato poi venduto per poche
migliaia di euro in un mercatino del Nordest. Si tratta di una tela datata
intorno al 1765 e intitolata "Scena carnevalesca", che misura 89 centimetri
per 110.

Insieme al "Tiepolo" i carabinieri hanno ritrovato altre 93 opere d'arte.
Quattordici (sempre dipinti di olio su tela) sono risultate rubate a
famiglie nobili e a liberi professionisti, compresa una preziosissima icona
greco-ortodossa che, secondo gli esperti, proverrebbe da Costantinopoli, e
il cui valore ? inestimabile. Delle altre opere, soprattutto quadri e tele,
non si conosce l'esatta provenienza e, pertanto, state sottoposte a
sequestro preventivo in attesa di accertarne l'origine e i veri proprietari.
L'operazione ? stata messa a segno nel corso di quasi cinquanta
perquisizioni condotte in Friuli Venezia Giulia, Veneto, Lazio, Emilia
Romagna e Lombardia. 

Secondo i Carabinieri di Pordenone, le opere d'arte venivano rubate in case
e ville, soprattutto a Roma e nel resto del Lazio, e venivano poi immesse
sul mercato da un'organizzazione fortemente strutturata, circa dieci
persone, che effettuavano operazioni finanziarie con l'obiettivo di
nascondere i traffici. 
Per rivendere le opere rubate l'organizzazione utilizzava il canale dei
mercatini di Roma e dintorni, ma anche rigattieri e rivenditori di mobili e
oggetti usati nel Nordest. 
Le indagini, scattate lo scorso ottobre, sono state condotte dai Carabinieri
dei reparti speciali del Comando Provinciale di Pordenone e coordinate dalle
Procure della Repubblica di Treviso e Pordenone.

CARABINIERI RECUPERANO 166 DIPINTI COLLEZIONE SCALABRINO        
luned?, 04 giugno 2007 17:02  
  Firenze, 4 giu. - (Adnkronos) - C'e' anche la 'Donna sotto la doccia' di
Renato Guttuso tra i 166 dipinti recuperati dai carabinieri del Nucleo
Tutela Patrimonio Culturale di Firenze, in un'operazione condotta assieme ai
colleghi di Pistoia e Montecatini Terme. Le 166 opere d'arte contemporanea
fanno parte delle 190 mancanti appartenenti alla collezione dell'Accademia
d'Arte 'Dino Scalabrino' di Montecatini Terme (Pt) e alcune appartenenti a
privati, avute in prestito dall'Ente e mai restituite ai legittimi
proprietari, per un valore complessivo stimato in due milioni di euro. Una
persona e' stata denunciata in stato di liberta' all'Autorita' Giudiziaria
di Pistoia per appropriazione indebita.

L'Accademia d'Arte 'Dino Scalabrino' e' un ente che ha come scopo la
divulgazione dell'opera artistica italiana e straniera attraverso attivita'
interdisciplinari quali una scuola, l'organizzazione di mostre e
l'istituzione di un centro di arte contemporanea. La collezione e'
costituita da una importante raccolta di opere di artisti italiani e
stranieri dalla fine dell'Ottocento a oggi, in gran parte donate da artisti
e collezionisti. Inaugurata nel 1972, dopo lavori di riallestimento e
restauro, la raccolta e' stata riaperta al pubblico il 27 marzo 2005.
Custodisce sculture, ceramiche, pitture, disegni, oggettistica, manoscritti,
documenti storici, spartiti musicali, strumenti musicali. Tra le opere,
alcune di artisti quali Annigoni, Guttuso, Bueno, Fattori, Chini e Viani.

Il 6 febbraio 2007 Alberto Scalabrino, presidente del Consiglio di
Amministrazione, denunciava che il dipinto 'Donna sotto la doccia' di Renato
Guttuso ed un'altra trentina di quadri, tra i quali lavori di Lorenzo Viani,
una tela di Fernand Leger e una di Hans Arp, erano stati trafugati dalla
collezione dell'Accademia, con un danno quantificato in un milione di euro.

I militari del Nucleo Tutela Patrimonio Culturale di Firenze, coadiuvati dai
colleghi di Pistoia e Montecatini Terme (Pt), hanno accertato l'ammanco di
complessive 190 opere. Coordinati dalla Procura della Repubblica presso il
Tribunale di Pistoia, gli investigatori hanno individuato le persone che,
per la loro funzione o attivita', avevano avuto rapporti professionali con
l'Accademia Scalabrino. Nel frattempo sono state acquisite le denunce di
alcuni privati, preoccupati dalle notizie ampiamente riportate sulla stampa,
i quali non erano tornati in possesso delle opere concesse in prestito nel
corso di eventi culturali.

Sui soggetti verificati sono stati condotti accertamenti bancari e, fra
tutti, emergeva la figura di un professionista, dal 2004 responsabile presso
l'Ente dell'allestimento di eventi artistici nazionali e internazionali.
Intestatario di molteplici conti correnti, uno in particolare richiamava
l'attenzione dei militari perche' riferito a una societa' dallo stesso
gestita con un nome estremamente simile a quello dell'Ente montecatinese.
Sul conto venivano notati versamenti di numerosi assegni, tutti di discrete
somme.

Identificati i soggetti che avevano emesso i titoli di credito, i militari
dell'Arma si sono recati presso le loro abitazioni. Gli acquirenti hanno
confermato l'acquisto di opere dall'indagato. Accertata la provenienza
illecita delle opere, fino ad allora ignorata dai detentori, queste sono
state prese in consegna dai militari. L'operazione si e' svolta a
Montecatini Terme (Pt), Altopascio (Lu), Firenze, Prato, Montopoli Val
d'Arno (Pi), Buti (Pi), Vercelli, Torino, Roma e Forli'.

Prince George RCMP have launched an investigation that includes questioning
all staff at the Exploration Place, home to the P.G. Sports Hall of Fame
gallery. As well, anyone who has had access to the gallery will be drawn
into the probe. 

Police are treating the case as a theft, said Tracy Calogheros, executive
director of the Exploration Place. 

Missing are three Canadian amateur boxing championship gold medals and
Mann's gold medal from the British Empire Games (now known as the
Commonwealth Games). Mann, a member of the Hall of Fame who sits on the
local athletic commission, had loaned the items to the Hall, along with two
commemorative coins. 

Calogheros said it was the Tuesday following the May long weekend when staff
realized the items were missing. 

"There isn't any other explanation than they've been taken," said
Calogheros, adding that security camera video of that portion of the gallery
is being examined by investigators. 

"The items are not in our building. I'm so hurt for Harold. Having spoken to
him a number of times over the last week, I can't imagine anyone would do
that to that man. I'm angry someone violated the public trust. More
important than anything is getting them back because these items are
priceless and cannot be replaced. What has been done is beyond wrong." 

Calogheros said this is an isolated incident, and that other museum and
Sports Hall of Fame artifacts are safe.

'Clueless' thieves sell ?1million painting for ?350
Last updated at 20:54pm on 4th June 2007
 
 
A ?1 million painting stolen by a gang of 'clueless' thieves was discovered
on sale at a flea market for ?350. 

Giandomenico Tiepolo's Scenes from a Venetian Carnival was stolen last year
from a private collector. 

It was recovered from Pordenone, near Venice, along with more than a dozen
other works of art worth more than ?2.5million, following raids on a number
of markets across Italy. 

Police also arrested several members of a gang of art thieves who had
targeted homes in Rome. 

A spokesman said yesterday: "This gang was peddling works of art worth
millions for just a few hundred euros. They were completely clueless and had
no idea of the real value. 

"In fact to call them clueless would be a compliment." 

Tiepolo, whose works are characterised by vivid colour and movement, was
born in Venice in 1727.
