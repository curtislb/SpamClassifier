     The new DECTalk Express is USB.  It's more a matter of hardware 
synth manufacturers wanting to continue making money.  A Mojo pin drive 
with Win-Eyes or JAWS and a hardware synth is more portable across 
Windows platforms.  You can plug them into a library computer and 
go...if they'll let you.
