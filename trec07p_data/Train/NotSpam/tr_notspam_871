No I don't have SAS on my machine. Nobody in my group
uses it and we seldom use SPSS. I think one person has
STATA. Most of the work is more policy than data work
and the occasional spreadsheet (shudder) does for
basic work. 

I am too cheap to have us spend a huge amount (well,
large amount anyway) for something that  I am likely
to use for 5-10 minutes a year. The last time I wanted
a SPSS file exported to "delimited" I just asked
someone in another department whom I knew has it on
his labtop to do it. 

I just hike across campus to the nearest lab with SAS,
SPSS etc installed. Done occasionally and in decent
weather it is not a problem. Today it is turning into
a marathon but I need to lose some weight.
