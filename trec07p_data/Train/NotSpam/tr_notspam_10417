Splitting out the work of krb5_rd_req have been on the TODO list for  
some time now.

Forking and execing a suid binary is one one, talking to an existing  
processes another over IPC. Using IPC is probably prefered since fork 
()ing inside a lib is icky to say the least (stray SIGHLD,  
interesting fd's all over the place, etc).

it I was to write it it would write both ends and make a libkrbrdrep  
that a service lib winbind or kcm could link with to provide the  
funktionallity with an simple entry point (or two).

Love
