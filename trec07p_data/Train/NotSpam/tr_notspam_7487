Volker,

that's why I asked you to look at my changes :-)

The existing routine could not work on a socket that is expected to
get EOF. The caller has no way to know if ctdbd_socket_readable()
returning False means "no more data coming" or "no more just yet". So
we would spin forever in a traverse.

Taking out the return False was a workaround for this. To make it
non-blocking again the function will have to change in some other
way. I thought I'd let you choose what approach you want.

sure, thanks!

Also, I've now converted notify in s3 to use ctdb. I am still not
propogating the seqnum between nodes, so it should only work fully on
one node, but it isn't working. I also tested with clustering
disabled, and it still fails, so I suspect something deeper is wrong
with notify.

Cheers, Tridge
