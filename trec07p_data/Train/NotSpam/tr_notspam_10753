 Thanks for your solution, it worked perfectly, it was exactly what I
wanted.  I do have two more questions and hope you can help.  I have
another analysis exactly like the last one except it is done by month
instead of year.  When I graph it using barchart it makes the months go
in alphabetical order.  Is there anyway to change it so that the months
go in the correct order (jan, feb, march, etc,).  And how do I change
the colors of the bars in the graph, they are weird colors and I want to
change them.  
Thanks so much for your help.

Here's one solution using the lattice package:

library(lattice)
barchart(HSS ~ factor(Year), data = dataset, origin = 0,
         groups = Limit, auto.key = TRUE)
