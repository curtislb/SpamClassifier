More difficult.  You first have to determine at what array index the pattern
exists.

A file is not an array, unless you use the Tie::File module.

When all MAC entries are in the file are they all grouped together like the
FORWARD, INPUT and OUTPUT entries?  Where do you get the "sorted iptables
array" from?

Perhaps something like this (UNTESTED):

while ( <FILE> ) {
    if ( ?^-A OUTPUT? ) {
        print @sorted_iptables;
        }
    print;
    }
