Hi all,

I have a Package A with serveral subs in it and now I want to make a package A::Types with some constants in it.

I have A.pm with:

..some code and subs ..

package A::Type;
use constant  { CONST1 => "foo", CONST2 => "bar"};
package A;

..some more code and subs..



now I wanted to use the Exporter and wrote in the "package A::Type" part of the file:

sub BEGIN {
	use Exporter;
	our @ISA = qw(Exporter);
	our @EXPORT_OK = qw(CONST1 CONST2);
	our %EXPORT_TAGS = ( standard =>  [qw(CONST1 CONST2)]);
}

but now I dont know to import the stuff. I can't do a "use A::Type qw(:standard)" because I dont have A/Type.pm
do you have any suggestions how this can be done?

thanks for the help!
 Martin
