Seems very close to catch *all* non-free software.

Even when access to the source code is granted, if restrictive licensing
agreements are in place, it's proprietary software.
As soon as *one* action among use, modification, selling and
distribution, is controlled exclusively by a single party, it's
proprietary software.

I simply consider semi-free software not *so* better than other non-free
software.  Consequently I do not insist that much on the distinction
between semi-free software and the rest of non-free software: I just
call it all "proprietary software", more or less interchangeably with
"non-free software".

But please note that the distinction you seem to have made so far is a
different one: you have linked "proprietary software" with closeness and
unavailability of source.  The concept of semi-free software (as defined
by the FSF) is instead based on "for non-profit purposes only"
restrictions.
