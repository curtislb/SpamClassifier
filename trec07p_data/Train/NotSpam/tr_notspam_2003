*Artefact thieves ravage Nok culture*
Sunday, Apr 15, 2007

The highly revered historical sites of the Nok culture have been reduced 
to a shadow of the past as looters have invaded the fields.

Two German archeologists from the Frankfurt University, Prof. Peter 
Breunig and Dr. Nicole Rupp, who had been working on the Nok sites in 
the last two months made the disclosure.

The archeologists, who had an interactive session with newsmen in Abuja 
last week on their experience in the field, said the sites were in a 
?deplorable state?.

Breunig said that the sites required urgent attention as a considerable 
amount of damage had been done to the trenches that once housed the Nok 
artefacts.

?Our mission is not business and we are concerned about the serious 
damage done because it was done for commercial reasons,? he said.

Breunig said the Nok terracotta and its cultural links was still among 
the greatest discoveries of archeology and would continue to command 
global attention.

?We are not after terra cotas but we are here to reconstruct some of the 
distortions of the Nok history,? he said.

Breunig said the museum at the Nok village does not meet acceptable 
standards ??as it is only a table with bits of artifacts?.

Rupp had said that the situation at the sites was complicated as some of 
the custodians said they sold artifacts to feed their families.

?The Nok sites have been turned into a battle field because you find 
whole paths like two football fields completely excavated,? he added.

?It is a very complicated matter that cannot be solved by an 
archeologist,? she said.

Speaking at the same session, the Director General of the National 
Commission for Museums and Monuments, Dr Joseph Eboreime, said the 
government had adopted a community-based approach to preserve artifacts.

He said the bottom - up approach involved working hand in hand with 
communities on how to preserve their values and the importance of 
keeping their historical identities.

Eboreime said that the approach was three-pronged as it would also 
involve developing the customary laws and mores of the people and 
ensuring administrative contacts.

He said there was already a silent effort at retrieving some of the 
stolen artifacts in \some museums from abroad and it would have security 
implications.

Our correspondent reports that the Nok culture, situated in Kwoi Local 
Government Area in Kaduna, is among the 100th discoveries of archaeology.

    Santana Row gallery mystified by art theft
PAINTING DISAPPEARS WHILE STAFF AT SANTANA ROW SHOP DISTRACTED
By Jessie Mangaliman
Mercury News
San Jose Mercury News
Article Launched:04/15/2007 01:39:25 AM PDT

Whether it was the oil painting's contrast of sunlight and moonlight or 
the $35,000 price tag that caught the thief's eye, Frank Licsko's 
treasured art is gone.

"To me it's a big loss. I thought, `Should I be flattered? Should I be 
upset?' Someone is going around stealing expensive paintings!" said the 
San Jose artist.

One month after it vanished in broad daylight from a Santana Row art 
gallery, the painting is still missing.

"It's an unusual image," said Licsko, author of the work, titled "Tree 
of Life." It's an oil painting of an earth-like disc, in yin-yang style 
- one side in sunlight, the other in moonlight.

The painting, measuring 3 feet by 3 feet, had been in consignment at the 
Blu Art Gallery at Santana Row since November, one of hundreds of 
paintings displayed in the 6,000-square-foot gallery.

On March 15, between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., the painting disappeared while 
two employees and the manager were attending to other things.

"Whoever did this had to distract all of us at once," said gallery owner 
John Nassar. "This is professional."

In the frame, the painting measured five-foot square, and would have 
been difficult to carry out of the gallery, Nassar said.

"I've been in this business for 15 years," he said, "and I've never seen 
this happen. This is a very sophisticated type of theft."

Nassar said when he opened the store at 11 a.m., the painting was still 
in the gallery. But when another employee arrived to begin a new shift 
at 1 p.m., the first thing he noticed was the blank spot on a wall where 
the painting was hung, 20 feet from the gallery entrance.

Nassar said he has since learned from Santana Row security that 
surveillance cameras were not scanning in the vicinity at the time. 
Nassar reported the theft to Santana Row security, who reported it to 
San Jose police.

Sgt. Nick Muyo confirmed the theft, but was unable to provide details on 
Friday. And a spokesman for Santana Row said he was checking on the 
status of the case.

As for the 61-year-old Licsko, he was stunned when he heard about the theft.

"My jaw dropped," he said.

Ceramic plate worth $3,700 stolen from Ohio artist during sale
**
*Associated Press*

*CLEVELAND HEIGHTS, Ohio - *A hand-crafted ceramic plate valued at 
$3,700 was stolen from property owned by acclaimed artist and industrial 
designer Viktor Schreckengost, his stepson said.

The second-edition plate, produced last year and based on 
Schreckengost's 1931 "Jazz Bowl" series of plates and bowls that became 
icons of the Art Deco era, was stolen from an unlocked china cabinet 
during an estate sale Saturday, stepson Chip Nowacek said.

About 400 people attended the sale at a 32-room mansion that 
Schreckengost's second wife, Gene, lived in before they were married in 
1991, Nowacek said. The mansion is just a few doors down from where the 
couple currently lives in this Cleveland suburb.

Police have not announced an arrest.

"Whoever it was knew what they were doing," Nowacek, 41, said. "To pull 
something like that off with all these people around, it was just 
incredible."

Police searched vehicles and questioned people who attended sale but 
didn't find the plate, Nowacek said. The family will be contacting art 
dealers in New York, Los Angeles and Miami to make them aware of the 
theft and will monitor the Internet to see if it shows up on the auction 
Web site eBay, he said.

The plate is signed by Schreckengost and contains many studio markings 
that make it easy to identify, Nowacek said.

Schreckengost, 100, is a prolific designer whose works range from toys, 
ceramics and paintings to dinnerware and trucks.

His artistic creations include paintings, sketches, sculptures and famed 
New Yorker ceramics that caught the eye of Eleanor Roosevelt. His 
industrial designs include millions of bicycles sold by Sears, iconic 
children's pedal wagons, lawn chairs, sit-down lawn mowers, American 
Limoges dinnerware - all with eye-catching flair.

Churches are easy prey for art thieves
BY DANE STICKNEY AND ASHLEY HASSEBROEK
WORLD-HERALD STAFF WRITERS

Chances are, thieves aren't taking paintings from Omaha churches to 
enhance their spiritual lives.

More likely it's to enhance their bank accounts, investigators say.

But though the motivation seems clear, much about the yearlong rash of 
thefts of church paintings puzzles art scholars and investigators 
locally and nationwide.

Since last May, thieves have taken works from St. Cecilia Cathedral and 
First Covenant, All Saints Episcopal, Immaculate Conception Catholic, 
St. Thomas More Catholic and St. Joseph Catholic Churches.

The thefts don't tie into any particular national or global trend. Most 
of the works don't have a large resale market.

So they're tough to figure out.

John Wilson, head curator of Omaha's Joslyn Art Museum, said art thefts 
from churches are widespread in South America, Italy and other places 
abroad.

"But why is it happening in the middle of America, in Omaha? I don't 
have a clue," he said.

It's not happening in other Midlands museums or churches.

Anna McAlpine, a spokeswoman for the American Association of Museums, 
said galleries across the country have not been seeing thefts of 
religious art.

Representatives of the Catholic Archdioceses of St. Louis and St. 
Paul-Minneapolis and the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph, Mo., say 
they haven't heard of thefts of art from their churches.

Omaha may be a surprising spot, but churches aren't. They are often 
notorious for having lax security.

"Churches don't see these artworks as investments," Wilson said. "They 
hang the paintings for spiritual purposes, and sometimes they may be a 
little too trusting."

The criminals aren't drawn to the works because of spirituality, said 
Bob Spiel, a Chicago-based private investigator, security consultant and 
former art theft and forgery investigator for the New York City branch 
of the FBI. He has worked dozens of cases similar to those in Omaha. The 
motivation is always the same.

"It's always about money," Spiel said. "Someone is looking to turn the 
painting around for some quick cash."

It doesn't have to be lots of money. The value of the artworks snatched 
from Omaha churches ranges from about $500 to the $100,000 painting of 
the Virgin Mary at St. Cecilia Cathedral, said Brother William Woeger, 
executive director of the Cathedral Arts Project.

Most works will reap at least some cash.

The black market is the most common outlet. The thief could sell the 
painting for a small fraction of its value to a collector or dealer. 
Often, a single painting is swapped a number of times with gradually 
increasing prices until it reaches an auction house, a dealer or a 
private buyer.

The more quickly the artwork gets outside the United States - especially 
to Latin America or some European countries - the lower the chances it 
will be recovered.

It still happens, though, said Beth Kocher, a New York-based art 
historian with the Art Loss Register, an international organization that 
recovers artwork.

The organization, which is working on the Omaha cases, recovers more 
than 150 stolen works each year, mostly at auction houses. About 40 
percent of the recoveries are made outside the country where the piece 
was stolen.

Many buyers, dealers and auction houses check the works with the FBI's 
National Stolen Art File, Interpol or the Art Loss Register before they 
buy, Kocher said.

Because of that, the risk of selling artwork on the black market is 
increasingly outweighing the reward to thieves.

Even if they don't get caught, they hardly ever get anything close to 
the value of the works.

"We have had cases where a work is worth $1 million and is sold on the 
black market for $800," Kocher said.

Though black market profits may not be huge, the sales are easy to cover 
up, said John Geppert, a finance professor at the University of 
Nebraska-Lincoln.

Businesses that deal with a lot of cash have been known to buy stolen 
artwork at deep discounts, then sell them for closer to the full price.

"Because they deal almost exclusively in cash, it's very easy to hide 
that transaction in an audit or an investigation," Geppert said.

Artwork doesn't even have to be sold to make the thief some cash. 
Increasingly, art is being used for collateral in drug operations, Spiel 
said.

A thief without cash could give a drug lord a painting for collateral. 
Once the thief sells the drugs, he keeps a profit, pays the drug lord 
and gets his painting back.

"That's certainly a possibility," said Raneta Mack, a criminal law 
professor at Creighton University. "Anything that has value can be used 
as collateral in drug deals. A painting works just fine."

While the motivation is clear-cut, profiling an art thief is much 
harder, Spiel said.

The Omaha Police Department is treating the first five burglaries as 
related, but are investigating the most recent - the theft of a piece, 
said to be worth $50,000, from First Covenant Church sometime between 
October and this month - as an unrelated incident.

Spiel would be surprised if the same person - or group of people - 
committed all the church break-ins.

"You've probably got a copycat phenomenon going on," he said. "Each time 
a burglary gets some publicity, the churches look like easier targets."

 From here to eternity: Egyptian artefacts
Virginia Blackburn on Ancient Egyptian artefacts for the afterlife
April 14, 2007


Collecting can throw up strange anomalies, one of them being that the 
Ancient Egyptian rituals of death have, ironically, given long life to 
that culture?s artefacts.

The Egyptians placed vast numbers of artefacts in their tombs ? from 
everyday objects, which they believed would be needed in the afterlife, 
to pieces that were created especially for the tombs ? with the result 
that a great deal has been preserved to the present day.

And many are affordable. Charles Ede, the London-based gallery, has 
published a new catalogue and it is still possible to buy, for example, 
an amulet of the god Khnum for ?650. Even so, that is a great deal more 
than it would have cost a few decades ago.

?Egyptian antiquities really became popular among collectors in 1972, 
when the British Museum staged the Tutankhamun exhibition,? says James 
Ede, the gallery?s owner. ?Since then, prices for the good Egyptian 
antiquities have appreciated by 20 to 50 times.?

However, he is quick to emphasise that no one should buy these pieces as 
an investment, rather as an object to be greatly loved.

The pieces in the new catalogue are exquisite. Egyptian antiquities are 
classed from the predynastic era of 3500BC until about 500BC. ?The 
afterlife was of paramount importance,? Mr Ede explains. ?They would 
place /ushabti/ ? meaning ?answerer? ? figures in their tombs to serve 
them in the afterlife /./ Initially they would have only two, but in 
time this grew until they would have had at least one for each day of 
the year and then they even introduced figures of overseer /ushabti/.?

Mr Ede has several /ushabti/ in the new catalogue. No 7 is a rare and 
beautiful piece, hand-carved out of limestone. It is in excellent 
condition and its colour has not deteriorated. The piece dates from 
about 1200BC and on it a carved inscription in hieroglyphics gives the 
name of its owner: ?The chief scribe and master of the house, Hormin?. 
The price is a hefty ?55,000.

No 16 in the catalogue is a fa?ence /ushabti/, with a quartz-paste glaze 
of bright cobalt-blue ? a colour associated with the afterlife. Its 
owner was the son of Ramses IX and, with only three existing 
/ushabti/known to have belonged to him, the ?12,000 price tag is no 
surprise.

Also featured in the catalogue is a bronze of the catheaded goddess 
Bastet. ?Its features are remarkably lifelike,? Mr Ede says. ?Although 
the Egyptians did put figures of their gods in the tombs, this may have 
come from a private chapel.? The price is ?45,000.

Also of great interest are four limestone canopic jars designed to hold 
the viscera of the deceased. During mummification the heart was left 
intact, while the brain was removed and destroyed. The liver, lungs, 
stomach and intestines, however, were taken out and put into the four 
pots. These represented the four sons of Horus, the four points of the 
compass and the four protective goddesses. The set costs ?37,500.

There is also a great deal to tempt the more modest collector. A 
delicate apple-green fa?ence of Thoth, the ibis-headed scribe of the 
gods, is only ?900, while an amulet of Tauert, the pregnant hippopotamus 
goddess of childbirth, is ?950.

It is astonishing to look at some of the pieces in the catalogue and 
reflect that they have existed for 5,000 years. There are two jars from 
about 3100BC, decorated in a na?ve style. No 40 depicts an aloe tree and 
is priced at ?2,900, while No 39, shows the River Nile with hills rising 
above it and is priced at ?9,750.

The catalogue features 50 objects in total and although the items will 
be on sale for the next month, the gallery has limited opening hours so 
it is best to ring in advance.

Egyptian art with prices fit for a Pharaoh
April 15, 2006

WHAT price a piece of history ? or ancient history, no less? Of course, 
in one sense, the deeds of the past are beyond price, but the artefacts 
of our ancestors certainly aren?t.

For anyone interested in one of the most sophisticated ancient 
civilisations, Charles Ede, a gallery in London, is currently holding 
its annual exhibition of Ancient Egyptian art, ranging from the 
pre-dynastic period in 3000BC to 100BC.

The more expensive pieces, as you would expect, command prices fit for a 
Pharaoh, but it is possible to buy a small amulet for about ?100.

James Ede, who put the sale together, says: ?One of the most remarkable 
aspects of Egyptian art was the wide range of materials used. The 
purposes were diverse and the materials varied. For example, in our 
exhibition alone, you can find gold inlay, hippo ivory, wood and stones.

?One of my favourite pieces is a wand made from hippo ivory. It was a 
domestic object, designed to be used by a woman. They were used for many 
purposes, such as warding off snakes and hidden dangers.? At ?16,000, 
the wand is one of the more expensive items in the sale.

The quality of the work is extraordinary. ?In Ancient Egypt, there was 
no word for artist ? they were just considered to be craftsmen,? Mr Ede 
says. ?They often worked in very hard substances, such as granite, but 
they didn?t have anything stronger than granite itself as a tool, so the 
process could take years. We have a ram?s head that was formed by honing 
it with another piece of rock over the years, after which it was 
smoothed with sand and then chiselled.?

Another very expensive piece, priced at ?35,000, is a fragment from the 
side of a sarcophagus depicting two of the sons of Horus: the 
jackal-headed Duamutef and the falcon-headed Qebhsenuef. ?The stance of 
the figures is classic Egyptian style,? Mr Ede says. ?The head and arms 
are portrayed from the side, while the body is portrayed from the front.?

The piece dates from 1200BC to 1100BC, but Mr Ede points out that the 
style employed here has been used throughout millennia of Egyptian art.

Among the less expensive items are amulets, which were designed to 
protect their owner from specific evils and problems. Mr Ede says: ?They 
were worn while the owner was alive and after death they were wrapped in 
the folds of the mummy. They are popular with collectors because they 
are not too expensive and do not take up a lot of space.?

The cheapest is ?110 and depicts a sow. The forms of the figures are 
certainly intriguing: they include the lion goddess Sekhmet (?200), 
Nefertum seated on a block throne while wearing a lotus head-dress 
(?385) and a seated ibis, its beak resting on the Feather of Truth (?480).

Many of the pieces had a purpose beyond the grave. ?The Egyptians 
believed that, in the afterlife, you had to perform tasks such as 
working in the fields to pay your way,? Mr Ede says. ?The only trouble 
was that the Pharaohs didn?t want to. So instead they created ushabti 
figures, which were designed to do the work for them.

?The ushabtis, which are mentioned in the /Book of the Dead, /the 
Egyptian equivalent of the Bible, would be placed in the tomb and were 
often inscribed with a spell that would call upon them to work. The word 
ushabti means answer and the ushabti figures are also known as workers 
for the dead.?

But will they hold their value? Mr Ede says that, like all art, these 
pieces should be bought for the love of them, not as investments. 
Nevertheless, prices have soared over the years, particularly in the 
upper end of the market.

?If my father had bought something in the 1960s for ?7, it would 
probably be worth ?70 now,? he says. ?But if he had bought something 
worth ?600, it would now be worth ?60,000. Over the past 20 to 30 years, 
prices have more than kept pace with inflation.?
