						<div class=3D"GreyHeading">SUE BARKER ON THE ARTOIS CHAMPIONSHIPS</di=
v>
						<div>I hear many players saying that the Artois Championships at Quee=
n's Club is their favourite tournament of the year and it is easy to unders=
tand why.
<br>

<br>
There is such a wealth of tradition at this impressive club and it is steep=
ed in a long history.
<br>

<br>
When players travel round the world they encounter a lot of arenas with fac=
eless locker rooms and very little atmosphere, but here they have the splen=
dour of the clubhouse in wonderful relaxed surroundings.=20
<br>

<br>
One man revelling here in West London is the phenomenon that is Rafael Nada=
l.
<br>

<br>
Last year he seemed to take a while to get used to the grass, but right fro=
m the word go this week he has looked comfortable which is remarkable after=
 such an intensive clay court season.
<br>

<br>
To arrive here and play so well just 48 hours after dealing with the hype a=
nd mental and physical exertion of winning his third French Open title is v=
ery impressive.
<br>

<br>
Nadal's biggest rival could be Andy Roddick and the top two seeds are sched=
uled to clash in the final should they both progress.
<br>

<br>
Roddick is now under the tutelage of the legendary Jimmy Connors.
<br>

<br>
He has changed quite a lot of technical things to Andy's game, but what I h=
ave been looking for is the influence he has had on the mental side of his =
game.
<br>

<br>
Everybody thinks of Jimmy in his playing days as a driving force who psyche=
d himself up and didn't just give 100%, he gave 150% in every match.
<br>

<br>
In his match against Alex Bogdanovic, Roddick obviously wasn't playing that=
 well, but he psyched himself up and talked himself into playing well, whic=
h had all the hallmarks of his coach.
<br>

<br>
Once the Queen's final is finished, it's Eastbourne next week and then Wimb=
ledon.=20
<br>

<br>
There is so much to savour - in case you hadn't realised this really is my =
favourite time of year!
<br>

<br>
Enjoy the action,
<br>

<br>
Sue
<br>
