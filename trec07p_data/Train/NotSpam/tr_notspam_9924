Hello list,
I've been trying to get mailman working.
I've googled was able to find out that I had to edit exim.conf, etc.
I was wondering how people got the whole webpage thing to display.
I've gotten mailq taken care of, and all my other questions resolved, but this is one I haven't been able to find with google.
Thanks,
~~TheCreator~~
