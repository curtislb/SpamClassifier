Actually, I think as much as possible we want to prevent any kind of
splash selection screens.  What we do want to emphasize, on the other
hand are concise, well designed, self-contained activities.  These
activities should be independent.  They should be able to be passed
around, installed, and placed in the frame individually, not as a
bundle.

As per the Sugar guidelines for design and naming, they should be
called things like "Puzzle", "Soduku", "Experiment", etc.  The .info
files for activities provide a means of tagging activities, so you can
easily tag all of the activities with "Gcompris" and furthermore tag
all of the "algebra" related activities with "math", "algebra",
"numbers", "addition", etc.  This will allow the children to look in
their Journal and search for all of their activities that relate to
"science."  A number of yours would show up, and perhaps a few others.
 The hierarchy and bundled application metaphor isn't part of Sugar,
but by following some of these guidelines, it should be possible to
achieve similar results.

Does that help clarify the logic of the design a bit more?
