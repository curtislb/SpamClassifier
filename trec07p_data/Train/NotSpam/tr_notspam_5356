Featuring Lutts' Logic:

Mind The Gap

-----

So the Dow topped 13,000 yesterday.  What does that mean?  Nothing.   

And everything.  The Dow Industrial Average is not real; it's not even the
average price of 30 stocks; when was the last time you saw a stock priced
at $13,000 per share?  No, the Dow is just an artificial construct, and I
say the less attention paid to it the better.

But old habits die hard, and people have been referring to the Dow since
Charles Dow created the Index back in 1896.  Also it's a nice short word
we can all say . . . even if we don't know what it stands for.

So, because of the fact that people watch it, and because all media
trumpeted the Index's breaking up through the 13,000 ceiling yesterday,
the Index matters a lot.  Not because it matters, but because investors
think it matters.  Got it?

It's all about perception.

Perception is a word we use often in our office.  And it's a word I used a
lot last night, when I spoke to the Boston Investors' Business Daily
Group.

It was a great group, but I went with the impression that I'd find a group
of people who were attuned to the methods of Investors' Business Daily,
methods that center on growth of revenues and earnings, and strength of
price movements.  But I was wrong.  What I found was a diverse group of
investors.  They were all intelligent and interested and ready to learn,
and thus a great audience, but many of them were mired - to use a strong
word - in the world of fundamentals.

So I spent a lot of time dwelling on the fact that it's changes in
perceptions that make stocks move.  It's not earnings announcements by
themselves, and it's not news about new products or new markets.   

It's changing perceptions.  And these perceptions are all reflected - to
those investors who can interpret them - in the charts!

-----

Changes in perceptions, in fact, are a big reason for the strength in
solar power stocks today.

First, these stocks are young.  They're not household names yet, and
they're certainly not in many institutional (mutual funds, pension funds,
etc.) portfolios yet.  But day after day, more and more investors, both
individual and professional, are waking up to the fact that these stocks
exist, and that these companies are growing fast, and thus their
perceptions of the group improve . . . from ignorance to interest.

And when people get interested enough, they buy.  Now, no one loves these
stocks yet; no one's known them long enough to fall in love.   

But some investors are on their way there.  And there is no selling
pressure yet!  Sure, there are little profit-taking episodes from
short-term speculators, but basically all the news about these companies
is good, so there's no reason for perceptions to worsen.   

The main force driving these stocks is simply increased visibility of
their presence, and the growth of revenues and earnings in the companies
behind the stocks.

And what growth it is!  These companies are growing so fast - almost all
are growing revenues and earnings at rates of 100% or better - that
perception has a hard time keeping up with the reality.

These stocks are also hot because of the growing perception by the public
that global warming is real, and the growing perception that more
legislation will "encourage" us to burn fewer fossil fuels and to adopt
more green alternatives in the years and decades ahead.

I've written about this before, and got some flack about global warming
not being real, and I want to point out that what I believe about global
warming doesn't matter, and what you believe doesn't matter.

What matters is that investors as a whole increasingly believe that global
warming is real, and that governments will take action, and those changing
perceptions create investing opportunities in the alternative energy
industry today.

Editor's Note

We've recently completed a report on the solar power industry, detailing
the major investment plays in the industry.  Interestingly, half are
Chinese companies, and half are located in the U.S.  It's a great primer

Back on the subject of perception, I want to talk about what happens when
you fall in love with a stock.  It's the same thing that happens when you
fall in love with a person; your vision gets a little cloudy.

For example, after the meeting last night, as I was leaving the room, a
woman approached and asked what she should do with her Whole Foods (WFMI)
stock.  She said she had held it on the way up, making a nice profit, but
then had held on the way down, too, and watched most of her profit
disappear.  She assured me, however, that she didn't yet have a loss, as
if that rationalized the whole process.

My response?  Without hesitating, I told her to sell.  And then I
explained why.

Whole Foods was once a great stock.  From its IPO in 1992 to its 2005 top,
it grew more than 2,500%.  Along the way it became a great, well-loved
company, the world's #1 organic grocer.  It certainly sells things that
shoppers feel good about.  I know I feel good when my wife brings home
fresh sushi from Whole Foods for my lunch!  But the problem is that after
thirteen years of terrific growth, Whole Foods reached the point of peak
perception, the point when every investor involved felt good about the
company . . . and owned it.  And when there was no one left to discover it
and buy it - when perception of the company could increase no more - it
was at risk of going down

At that point, which came in December 2005, the stock had a PE ratio of
65, even though the earnings growth rate had never got higher than 33% in
recent years.  So when business got just a little difficult, investors
began selling.  And they've been selling for the past sixteen months,
driving the stock down from 80 to a recent low of 42.

Whole Foods is not in trouble; it's still a great place to shop.  But the
company is finding it hard to maintain its previous growth rate; revenue
growth has slowed from 20% back then to 12% in the latest quarter.  And
earnings?  While they were growing at an average rate of 23% in the
previous three quarters, in the latest quarter they fell by 5%!  Most
telling of all is the fact that profit margins slipped to 2.9%, for the
lowest margin in the previous 4 years!

At the same time those earnings were released, the company announced that
it would buy the country's #2 natural foods retailer, Wild Oats, for $565
million, and that news helped the stock a bit.  But there's no way this is
going to make it easier for the company to increase margins!

It's all about changing perceptions.  Whole Foods was once a golden
company that could do no wrong.  Now it's disappointed shareholders.   
It's created losers where once it had only winners.  Many of those
investors will now become sellers, as they ever so slowly change their
opinions and give up on the stock.

But that takes time, especially when you're a happy customer of the
company!  So the stock may well rally, but its progress will be impeded by
the selling of shareholders looking to "get out even."

Bottom line.  Don't fall in love with stocks.  Don't confuse the company
with the stock.  Respect the force of mass changes in investor perception.
 And sell when a trend turns down.

And now, back to the market for a final comment.  Over in London, you'll
see signs where the subway (Tube) platform meets the trains, saying, "Mind
the Gap."  The gap is normally narrow, but in stations where the track
curves, it could theoretically swallow a small body, and the authorities
would prefer to avoid that.  Thus the warnings.

Today, I want you to mind the gaps in Dow stocks . . . in a good way. 
Look at Alcoa (AA), America Express (AXP), Citigroup (C), Caterpillar
(CAT), Coca Cola (KO), Honeywell (HON), International Business Machines
(IBM), JP Morgan Chase (JPM), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Merck (MRK). 
Every one of these stocks (that's one-third of the Dow Industrials!) has
gapped higher in recent days, usually on earnings.  This is strong stuff,
indicative of big changes in perception by big institutions, and in my
opinion, it's the closest you'll get to a guaranteed notice that the
market will be climbing higher in the weeks and months ahead.
