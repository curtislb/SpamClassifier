I am the founder of a new company, Strayform.  The goal of
the site is provide an alternative means for musicians,
programmers, movie producers, and authors to fund,
publicize, and distribute their works.  I would like to
get feedback on the concept and the site itself.

 

&#8211; The Philosophy &#8211;

Historically publishing companies provided many useful
services for creative producers.  They provided equipment
and facilities, funded artists, developed worldwide
distribution channels, and publicized and advertised on
artists
’ behalf.  But as time went on the industry became
bloated and corrupt.  Artists have been forced into
restrictive contracts, lost control of the copyrights, and
given small cuts of the revenue.  Consumers have been
forced to pay exorbitant prices and suffer DRM and nasty
lawsuits.  

 

But the industry has undergone massive change.  In the
Internet age, the functions of the media industry are
being taken over by consumers and artists themselves.  The
price of equipment has dropped so that individuals can now
create professional quality productions independently. 
Fans now use blogs, messengers, and e-mail to spread the
word about what they like.  There is no longer a need to
ship CDs, books, or DVDs as File sharing services offers a
costless distribution method.  

 

The only missing piece now is “funding”.  While file
sharing is great, the result of unchecked piracy will
leave artists with no way to make money and therefore no
incentive to produce new media.  It is time for the
funding model to evolve.  Historically, bundled into the
cost of each CD or book is the cost of production and
distribution.  But now with the internet distribution is
nearly costless.  Let
’s move the payment forward to the point of creation.  
Recording companies pay artists upfront to create
something new and then charge the consumers per copy; let
’s have fans pay the artists directly and give them the
freedom to use and share.  They will use this freedom to
distribute and promote, providing a valuable service to
artists.  The end result would be lower total costs, more
freedom and control for artists and consumers, and new
communities with strong ties between artists and fans.

 

&#8211; The Site &#8211;

With actualizing this vision in mind, I created
www.strayform.com.  It works like a social network for
artist and fans with specialized features to promote,
fund, and distribute new media.  A library of CC licensed
media leads to you to discover new artists.  Becoming fans
of these artists and selecting media as one of your
favorites allows us to rank and provide recommendations,
while giving you specialized privileges and notifications.
 People with similar interests surfing your pages use
these connections and find new favorites and artists as
well.  These massive connectivity provides a network that
funnels interest into Proposals.  Proposals are artists
’ offers to create new CC licensed media funded by fans. 
The more proposals that are completed the large the
library grows.  For artists, the more of their media
circulating the more fans they gather.  The more fans an
artist has the more money he can make on each successive
proposal, the greater the incentive to create new works. 
As the ecosystem grows we have a new system for funding,
promotion, and distribution built by fans and artists.  

 

We are a very small company, but have created an expansive
system based on this concept.  We have just launched and
would like feedback on how to improve our system and would
like to get the word out about Strayform.  So please try
our site out and give me your feedback, I am Member 
“Stray Brandt.”  We are new and small so I am sure we
have a lot of room for improvement, but please join us and
help us reach this vision.
