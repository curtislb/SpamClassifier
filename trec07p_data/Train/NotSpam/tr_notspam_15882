The script needs to use tidy to strip garbage from an html file prior  
to reading it. It's a file automatically generated by another company  
and it's filled with junk, hence no chance to fix it at the source.

The HTML::Tidy module would be fine but it doesn't pass testing on my  
box, and won't work with a forced install. I took a look and found  
that that seems to be a recurring problem on OS X 10.4. I haven't yet  
looked thru the code to determine the source of the problem as it  
seemed that running either Shell or system () was an interesting  
thing to learn. I might have been wrong there!

I've had success running hard coded paths and stuff, but now see that  
there's this space problem, which I didn't realize since Perl was  
handling paths nicely all by itself!
