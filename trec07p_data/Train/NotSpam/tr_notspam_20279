You can still install gentoo you just need to use one of the previous
livecds such as2007.1 or even one of the earlier ones such as 2006.1.
All a new release with gentoo means is a new set of livecds and more
current stages. Long as you've got internet access you can still
download a current stage.

Also nothing says that gentoo won't pick up the  fixed speakup patch and
put it into 2.6.22 once it's fixed.

I think the main reason it got dropped is because 1, gentoo wants to
keep moving forward, this means a more current kernel and it can't do
that with patches that break the kernel.
