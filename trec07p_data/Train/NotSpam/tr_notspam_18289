4:12 PM, 6/11/07, Update: Spacewalk begins=20

Astronauts Jim Reilly and Danny Olivas (prono: oh-LEE-vus) switched their s=
pacesuits to internal battery power at 4:02 p.m. to officially begin a plan=
ned six-and-a-half-hour spacewalk. The goal of the excursion is to electric=
ally connect a newly attached solar array truss segment to the station's po=
wer system and to remove a variety of launch locks and restraints so the hu=
ge blankets can be unfurled Tuesday.

This is the 84th spacewalk devoted to station assembly and maintenance sinc=
e construction began in 1998, the seventh so far this year and the first of=
 at least three EVAs by the Atlantis astronauts. It is the first spacewalk =
for Olivas and the third for Reilly.

"It's beautiful out here," Olivas marveled as he floated out of the Quest a=
irlock module.

Reilly and Olivas began today's spacewalk an hour and six minutes late beca=
use of work needed to reset the space station's control moment gyroscopes e=
arlier in the truss attachment sequence.

Here is an estimated timeline of today's activities based on the actual sta=
rt time of the EVA (in EDT and elapsed time; subject to change):

EDT........HH...MM...EVENT

07:12 PM...03...10...Reilly: Unstow forward solar array blanket box
07:17 PM...03...15...Olivas: Unstow aft solar array blanket box
07:32 PM...03...30...Reilly: Install rotary joint drive motor (1 of 2)
07:37 PM...03...35...Olivas: Remove unneeded insulation blankets
08:07 PM...04...05...Olivas: Rigidize internal truss braces
08:32 PM...04...30...Reilly: Remove rotary joint launch locks

09:47 PM...05...45...Cleanup and ingress
10:27 PM...06...25...Airlock repressurization
