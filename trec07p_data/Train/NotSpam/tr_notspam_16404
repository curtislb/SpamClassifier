Yes, that's the main reason for my involvement in this thread.

Though it's not just ftpmasters, it's Debian developers in general; so
that we don't end up with a consensus on debian-legal (or in ftpmaster)
that doesn't match the views of Debian as a whole.

AFAICS, that means welcoming developers who don't know the difference
between "subpoena" and "summons", not using it as a reason to ignore
them completely.

I used to be a regular on -legal, and I'm still subscribed. My views
(such as "people who aren't speaking on behalf of the project shouldn't
make it sound like they are"...) don't seem particularly welcome though,
so I tend not to bother.

I don't see any particular reason to think a new start or format would
help much, but I'm open to suggestions.

Cheers,
aj
