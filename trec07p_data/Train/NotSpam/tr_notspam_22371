<B>TONIGHT ON SHOWBIZ TONIGHT - CNN HEADLINE PRIME 11pm
ET/PT</B>

<b>PARIS HILTON'S LAST DAY IN JAIL!</b>
Has life behind bars really changed her? And can she really
turn from a sinner into a saint? Do not miss a Showbiz Tonight
Special report on <i>"The Perils Of Paris."</i> Only on TV's
most provocative entertainment news show.

<b>PARIS'S FIRST TV INTERVIEW - ON CNN THIS WEDNESDAY</B>
Watch CNN's Larry King, this Wednesday June 20th, at 9pm ET for
Paris's FIRST post-jail TV interview. Then at 11pm ET, Showbiz
Tonight will be the only entertainment news show on TV that
will be live with the VERY FIRST reactions to that blockbuster
broadcast.

<b>ONE-ON-ONE WITH MICHAEL MOORE</B>
Showbiz Tonight's Brooke Anderson sits down with the director
of "Sicko." His controversial movie, about the healthcare
industry, is one of the most buzzed-about movies of the summer.
So you bet we've got a lot to ask him - tonight.
