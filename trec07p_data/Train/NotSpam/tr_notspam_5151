greenbird sends us to Forbes for an account of [0]billions in investments
flowing to US patent troll companies. One example is [1]DeepNines, who is
suing McAfee over a [2]patent that covers combining an IDS and firewall
in a single device. The patent was filed on May 17, 2000 and issued on
June 6, 2006. No prior art for that, no siree. DeepNines is funded by "an
$8 million zero-coupon note to Altitude Capital Partners, a New York City
private equity firm, promising in return a cut of any winnings stemming
from the lawsuit. The payout is based on a formula that grants Altitude a
percentage that decreases with a bigger award."

[0]The Bad Astronomer writes "Astronomers in Europe have announced the
discovery of [1]a planet with only 5 times the Earth's mass, orbiting a
red dwarf star 20 light years away. It orbits the star so closely that it
only takes 13 days to go around... but the star is so cool that the
temperature of the planet is between 0 and 40 Celsius. At this
temperature there could be liquid water. Models indicate the planet is
either rocky like the Earth or covered in an ocean. While it's not known
if there actually is liquid water on the planet, this is a really big
discovery, and indicates that we are getting ever closer to finding
another Earth orbiting an alien star."

An anonymous reader writes "CNet.co.uk has done some simple head-to-head
testing of [0]camera phones alongside digital cameras to see which device
takes the best quality pictures. The results are surprising, with Nokia's
latest handset, featuring a built-in 5-megapixel camera, taking more
vibrant pictures in medium light conditions than a 10-megapixel dSLR. Of
course, the pictures aren't fully representative of how the images would
look at full size; but given that most people resize images to put on
Flickr, we could start to see a decline in dedicated digital cameras
sales and an increase in camera phone sales."

[0]blackbearnh writes to ask, "Why does Microsoft win the development
environment war so often, when we all know it's a lifetime lock-in to
Windows? Perhaps it's because the [1]open source community offers too
much choice." From the post: "Microsoft offers the certainty of no
choices. Choice isn't always good, and the open source community
sometimes offers far too many ways to skin the same cat, choices that are
born more out of pride, ego, or stubbornness than a genuine need for two
different paths. I won't point fingers, everyone knows examples... The
reality is that there are good, practical reasons that drive people into
the arms of the Redmond tool set, and we need to accept that as a fact
and learn from it, rather than shake our fists and curse the darkness."

[0]PetManimal writes "Curt Monash has a [1]middle way on the Net
neutrality debate. He writes that the classic 'Jeffersonet' — which
includes e-mail, instant messaging, much e-commerce, and most websites
created in the first 13 or so years of the Web — is 'the greatest tool in
human history to communicate research, teaching, news, and political
ideas, or to let tiny businesses compete worldwide,' and cannot be
compromised by a tiered Internet. On the other hand, a reliable, tiered
scheme is required for what he calls the 'Edisonet' — which consists of
'communication-rich applications such as entertainment, gaming,
telephony, telemedicine, teleteaching, or telemeetings of all kinds.'
Commenting on Monash's proposal, blogger Richi Jennings points to a
[2]lack of investment in Internet infrastructure and IPv6 technologies at
the root of the problem: '...if an application writer makes assumptions
that ignore realities such as the speed of light or temporary congestion,
their application's going to behave badly. But no premium QoS in the
world is going to help that. My sense is still that the ISPs that are
complaining about net neutrality are simply being greedy and don't want
to invest money to cope with the growth in usage.'"

Ollabelle writes "It's always been a bit of a mystery why plants absorb
red and blue light, reflecting green, when the sun emits the peak energy
of the visible spectrum in the green. A new theory offers one possible
answer: that the first chlorophyll-utilizing microbes evolved to
[0]exploit the red-and-blue light that older green-absorbing microbes
didn't use, eventually out-competing them through [1]greater efficiency
and the rise of oxygen."

CNN has a report on [0]the Wii's success in the games marketplace right
now, referring to their sales dominance as 'creaming the competition'.
The article tries to break down exactly why Nintendo's console has sold
so successfully, discussing the system's marketing, engineering, and
philosophy. "Next, engineers settled on a new approach for the Wii's
looks. Just as the DS shunned the Game Boy name to appeal to a broader
audience, the Wii would adopt a sleek white exterior instead of the
toylike loud colors used on the GameCube. Even CEO Iwata got involved in
the design process; at one point he handed engineers a stack of DVD jewel
cases and told them the console should not be much bigger. Why so small?
To work with the motion-sensitive wireless controller Nintendo planned,
Iwata reasoned, the console would have to sit directly beside the TV.
Make it any larger and customers would hesitate to leave it there. "
Their sales strategy is working in spades. CVG reports that at least one
analyst thinks that [1]Wii demand won't be met until 2009. This past
weekend Chris Kohler had an interesting comment on the 'ambassador
programs' Nintendo ran in advance of the Wii's launch, and [2]how that
might tie in to the system's financial success.

[1]presentation [PPT] "From Barnstorming to Boeing - Transforming the
Internet Into a Lifeline Utility" ([2]speakers notes avilable [PDF]).
I've long been interested in making the net a solid utility, and I have a
great deal of sympathy for the folks who have to go out and fix things at
3am. I'm very interested in building tools for those folks."

individuals and groups by allowing them a platform to air their thoughts.
This has been made possible because of the development of numerous
blogging tools. One which has gained mass appeal in the blogging
community is Wordpress. What is exciting about this tool or blog engine
is that even a lay person can easily master its use and get his or her
blog up and running in no time."

[0]Coryoth writes "The BBC is reporting that students in the UK are being
[1]encouraged to drop math at the senior levels. It seems that schools
are seeking to boost their standing on league tables by encouraging
students not to take 'hard' subjects like mathematics, in favor of easier
subjects in which they are assured good grades. The result is
Universities being forced to provide remedial math classes for science
students who haven't done math for two years. The BBC [2]provides a
comparison between Chinese and UK university entrance tests — a
comparison that makes the UK look woefully behind."

[0]Roland Piquepaille writes "What happens when you compress water in a
nano-sized space? According to Georgia Tech physicists, [1]water starts
to behave like a solid. "The confined water film behaves like a solid in
the vertical direction by forming layers parallel to the confining
surface, while maintaining it's liquidity in the horizontal direction
where it can flow out," said one of the researchers. "Water is a
wonderful lubricant, but it flows too easily for many applications. At
the one nanometer scale, water is a viscous fluid and could be a much
better lubricant," added another one."

badfrog asks: "Over the last 10 years, DSL and cable modem has upped its
speed (although in some instances only slightly) and dropped its price.
However, the price of a T1 has stayed almost exactly the same. If you had
asked me 10 years ago, I would have predicted any geek that wanted to
would have fiber or their own T1 line to the house by now. What is with
this sad state of affairs that a 'business class' 1.544Mbit connection is
hundreds of dollars more than a 6Mbit cable connection? Is it a
legitimate case that a high upload rate should increase cost so
significantly?"

After receiving the [0]highest number of notices from the RIAA about P2P
file sharing, Ohio University has announced a policy that [1]restricts
all fire sharing on the campus network. Some file-sharing programs that
could trigger action are Ares, Azureus, BitTorrent, BitLord, KaZaA,
LimeWire, Shareaza and uTorrent. Claiming that this effort is 'to ensure
that every student, faculty member and researcher has access to the
computer resources they need,' is this another nail in the coffin of
internet freedom in American universities or a needed step to prevent
illegal fire sharing?

Google's sponsored links to [0]spread their junk to people who click on

apparently bought the rights to several high profile search terms,
including searches that would return results for the Better Business
Bureau, among others. The story notes this was bound to happen, given the
way Google structures sponsored links: "The bad guys behind the attack
appeared to capitalize on an odd feature of Google's sponsored links.
Normally, when a viewer hovers over a hyperlink, the name of the site
that the computer user is about to access appears in the bottom left
corner of the browser window. But hovering over Google's sponsored links
shows nothing in that area. That blank space potentially gives bad guys
another way to hide where visitors will be taken first.""
