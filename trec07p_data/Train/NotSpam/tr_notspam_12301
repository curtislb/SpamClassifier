Hi people,

It's been a long time since I rolled my own kernel, so maybe my
checkout script is no longer current. I put the source tree in the
right place, made a symbolic to it from /usr/src/linux, ran my old
checkout script, and got this:

Patching version v26
CVSROOT not set.  Enter it below.  Hit enter for anonymous.
CVSROOT>
Logging in to :pserver:anonymous@fl.linux-speakup.org:2401/usr/src/CVS
CVS password:
/usr/src/CVS: no such repository


Anybody see the problem here? Not sure what to try next.

Thanks,
Chuck
