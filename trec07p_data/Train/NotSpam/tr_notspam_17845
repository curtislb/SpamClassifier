I'm not familiar with the arguments that have been made in the case of
Novell-Microsoft.  I'm certainly not aware of any argument why this aspect
of the GPL is not "fair" (=permitted under law) in a legal sense.

Sorry, I meant that I considered it ill-advised for the FSF to give their
tacit approval. :)

Oh.  So this is a case where you've assigned copyright to FSFE?  Does the
FSFE's copyright assignment procedure give you the right to continue
licensing your code under any license of your choice?

Seems rather overwrought to me for inclusion in a license file.  I would
suggest one of the following two approaches, either:

  In addition, for code copyright $foo, permission is explicitly granted to
  distribute binaries dynamically linked with libraries distributed under
  the OpenSSL license, even in cases where those libraries are distributed
  together with the binaries.

or:

  It is the understanding of $foo that the GPL permits distribution of
  binaries dynamically linked to OpenSSL, even in cases where OpenSSL is
  distributed together with the binaries.

But if the code is copyright: FSFE, I don't know if this is something you
would have to clear with them first.

What I understand from your other message is that previously, you had
modified the text of the license under which the code was being distributed.
That in particular is something that you can't do without permission from
all of the copyright holders, AFAICS.
