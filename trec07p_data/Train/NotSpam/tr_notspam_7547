Hello all.

Question regarding the text formatting modules out there.  I've found three on
CPAN that seem to have the functionality that I'm looking for but I don't know
which would best suit my needs.  The three are Text::Format, Text::Wrapper and
Text::Autoformat.

I have a script which populates and email with data that gets laid out in the
following manner:

customer_name
 Ticket ID                      Subject                     hh:mm
-----------------------------------------------------------------
    ######  Random Ticket Subject Line                      ##:##

However, the subject length is not a constant.  It can be quite short (maybe a
few characters long) to much longer than the alloted space I've given using
'printf'.  So, I'd like to be able to do things like wrap the text at a certain
length so that it might look something like this:

customer_name
 Ticket ID                      Subject                     hh:mm
-----------------------------------------------------------------
    ######  Random Ticket Subject Line Which Might End Up   ##:##
            Longer Than The Allocated Space Using printf
    ######  Next Random Ticket Subject Line                 ##:##

Of the three formatting options I've found, which might be my best bet to handle
something of this nature.  Also, after deciding which is the better option, how
would I go about printing the data out?  Can I populate variables with
pre-formatted text or would I perhaps do something with a printf command that
uses a call to one of the formatting methods?

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks
Mathew
