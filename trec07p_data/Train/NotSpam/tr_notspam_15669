Eben, this might be a great opportunity to spend some time with the
etoys team working out how you could realize what you have in mind
with existing tools.  As Alan notes, it is designed to do very much
what you are writing about -- as well as  doing some excellent sugar &
1200x900 emulation ;-)

I'd like to spend a day this coming week working through Alan's
50-of-100 notes, and the use cases you have in mind.  (Alan, can we
make the document public?)

As for presentations and slides, Etoys remains for the time being our
supported method for importing .ppt -- Rebecca, have you tried this?
Were you asking for something more specific?

SJ

ps - That might also be a good opportunity to think about what a
generic bundle looks like.
