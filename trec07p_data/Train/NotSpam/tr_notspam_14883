90% correct.  The other 10% is that the match starts left-to-right.
It will start with the first part of the string that can match, and
match as much of *that* as possible.  It will not search the rest of
the string to see if a longer match is possible later.  For example:

$string = 'abbabbbbba';
$string =~ /(b*)/;
In this case, $1 will be set to 'bb', because that is the *first*
longest string it could find, even though if it had continued, it
would have been able to find 'bbbbb' later.

This doesn't mean what you think it means.  This tells Perl that the
second token - (.*i?) can match as much of anything as it can,
followed by 0 or 1 i's.  That ? does not apply to the .* unless you
put it right after the *.  Compare and contrast with:
(.*?i), which means to match as little of anything as possible,
followed by exactly one i.

Right there is a problem.  Your token is (.*i).  That is, the last
character of this token must be an i.  It can't end with a p.  That
doesn't match.  The .* matches as much as it can until the last 'i',
then saves the 'i' for the i in the token.

It can't.  The token ends in an i.  'i' must be the last thing that
(.*i) matches.
