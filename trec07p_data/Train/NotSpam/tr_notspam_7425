I've had a similar problem with eth 0 saying link up then a few minutes later, 
eth 0 link down and eth 0 link up.  Is this was what the origonal poster is 
describing?  Is this an indication that my network card has died? Is the a 
setting which could be causing this.  I'm running debian sarge on that system 
with updates as of last August.
