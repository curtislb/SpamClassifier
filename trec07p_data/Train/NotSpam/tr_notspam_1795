That's again pointing at the possibly damaging strategy that allows both
A and B to install file C (usually the same file), but uninstalling
one of them will break the other one.

Why is it unclear?  Am I not making sense?

YOU CANNOT UNINSTALL A MODULE IN GENERAL WITH PERL.

You have to use some sort of packaging system where a human is involved to
make sure that each install is owned by exactly one package, or marks that a
file should not be removed when being uninstalled.
