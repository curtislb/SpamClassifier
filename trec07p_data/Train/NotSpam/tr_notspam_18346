Hello sm1lies,

The Registration Tool assembly competition is now open for registration. 

The Registration Tool allows users to view, register, and select positions for various competition types at TopCoder, including team competitions, individual competitions, coaching positions, and reviewers.  This assembly competition will add the business logic to the already developed front-end module using the existing components that provide the needed services. More details are available here: http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=ViewAssemblyActiveContests

Prize info:

* 1st place is $10,000
* 2nd place is $5,000 
 
There is also a $200 bonus for making a milestone, payable to any team (not just the first- or second-place ones) who make at least one milestone and a final submission.

And don't forget: In addition to the prize money, this contest can earn you valuable placement points -- and a share of the $90,000 prize pool -- in the new Digital Run Assembly Cup. Learn more: http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&d1=digital_run&d2=description

Good luck!
