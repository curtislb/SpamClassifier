Only on the T40 which had the ipw2100 built in.  I installed it on
Etch/Testing prior to Etch going stable, so it should work on Etch.

Not sure if I understand the problem.  Let me try to remember the
steps I took.

I installed the ipw2200-source package and went to the sourceforge
site for the firmware.  I put the firmware in /lib/firmware.  I then
used module-assistant to compile the source (m-a prepare : m-a a-i
ipw2100 in my case).  m-a does it all for you, extracts the source,
compiles it, and installs the modules.  See man module-assistant.
After that it's just a matter of finding out what the card can do and
how to tell it to do it.  :-)

I hope that is the answer you were after.

Regards

Wayne
