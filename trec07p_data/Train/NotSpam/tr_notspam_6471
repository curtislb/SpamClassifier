Hi Adisa,

See Jon Buckman (of magnatune)'s comments on publishing and collecting
societies here:

http://blogs.magnatune.com/buckman/2006/05/advice_to_magna.html

as far as i can work out, any licence with an NC clause will do fine
(Attribution-NonCommercial, Attribution-NonCommercial-Sharealike, or
Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives), but as I gather, the key thing is
to register as a publisher and as a composer with ASCAP rather than BMI, as
they take a licence to your work rather than an assignment of rights (you
still hold the copyright and give them permission to collect on your
behalf). I don't know how this would affect phonographic performance
royalties (royalties on the sound recording, rather than the composition),
or even whether such royalties are collected in the US at all (in the UK
this is administered by PPL, who currently will not collect on CC-licenced
music).

However, I am not a lawyer, and this is not legal advice.

Good luck!



Tim
