yes, but it demonstates that relying on good programming practice
doesn't work. We all know its good programming practice to remove
unused functions, and we know its good practice to make a function
static if its only used within one C file, yet we all still make that
mistake time and time again.

If you do have time to write the scripts I suggested, then it will be
really interesting to run them on projects that have a good reputation
for code quality (Linux kernel and gcc are obvious examples). I bet
they would find plenty of errors.

discussions like these are really good! We all have things to learn
about good coding practices. A lot of what I have learnt has come from
discussions like these within various projects, so don't cut it short
just because we don't agree.

Cheers, Tridge
