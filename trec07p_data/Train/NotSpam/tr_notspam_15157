Hi List,

1. MAPI Library 0.4 WARP Release
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

A new release of the MAPI library is now available for download. This
release fixes limitations from previous release (libmapi-0.2 MAILOOK)
and add a set of new features:

- sending emails to external recipients is now possible. We can now
send emails both to internal users and external ones. For external
users, the email will go through MAPI to SMTP and a winmail.dat file
is automatically appended to external emails copy.

- fetch/create appointments events in the default calendar folder
- fetch/create contacts in the default contact folder
- fetch/create tasks in the default task folder

- experimental exchange notification system. So far we can bind a
local udp port to receive Exchange notifications, subscribe and
unsubscribe folders to receive newmail and objectcreated
notifications, generates traffic to receive MAPI notifications and
decode them.

OpenChange tools have been improved:
* openchangeclient can:
        - send/fetch/delete emails
        - store attachments on the filesystem
        - fetch/send Appointment, Contact, Task, Note items
        - display the mailbox folder hierarchy
        - wait for newmail notifications and display them on standard
        output.

* exchange2mbox: It provides a way to synchronize an Exchange mailbox
with a mbox file. The tool is developed so it only retrieve mails not
already stored in the message ID index database and reflect changes
back to the Exchange server if local message copy are deleted. Finally
it now supports properly messages with multiple mime attachments.

This release also provides a better range of supported Exchange
servers. Thanks to beta testers, we know libmapi works with Exchange
2000 (US/FR/DE), Exchange 2003 and Small Business Server 2003.

2. OpenChange Evolution plugin TP1 release
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

This libmapi package is also coupled to the OpenChange evolution
plugin TP1 one. This plugin based on libmapi is able to:
        -  Create an OpenChange/Exchange account in the Evolution
Account wizard
        - Fetch, Send and Delete emails with/without attachments
        - Manage Importance and read/unread flags
        - Display a tiny hierarchy of Mailbox folders (inbox, outbox,
trash, sent items)
        - Save emails headers summary on the local filesystem

3. Download links

libmapi-0.4 RPM is currently provided with the Samba4 library needed and
will create a /usr/local/samba4 directory. Note that you should only use
this rpm if you intend to test openchange-eplugin easily.

Regards,

Julien.
