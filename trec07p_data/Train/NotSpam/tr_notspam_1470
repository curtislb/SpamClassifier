						<b>WOLFOWITZ</b>
<br>

<br>
If the World Bank evangelizes one thing it's good governance, free of corru=
ption. Ironic then that its chief, Paul Wolfowitz, finds himself at the cen=
tre of a nepotism scandal. He has apologised and accepted the blame for his=
 involvement in negotiations over his girlfriend's pay whilst she was worki=
ng alongside him.=20
<br>

<br>
But will that be enough to save his job? He's already made enemies along th=
e way for controversial decisions he's taken at the Bank. So will this scan=
dal just precipitate a resignation many have wanted to see for some time?=
=20
<br>

<br>
<b>RUSSIAN REVOLUTION</b>
<br>

<br>
The man who claims he made Putin now wants to break him, in no uncertain te=
rms. Boriz Berezovsky has called for an uprising against Putin and his remo=
val from government. He has insisted he doesn't mean through force, but thr=
ough a people's revolution. We will talk to the Kremlin tonight and see if =
they're trembling in their boots.
<br>

<br>
<b>NUCLEAR EXPLOSION</b>
<br>

<br>
Well, not exactly. But an explosion of power stations which will probably l=
eave the world with another 70 over the next two decades.=20
<br>

<br>
Our film tonight charts the remarkable transformation of a rogue nuclear st=
ate which defied weapons inspectors to do its own thing - much to the chagr=
in of the west. That country? India. It is now the largest democracy in the=
 world, and one that is well on the road to being self sufficient in provid=
ing cheap, clean energy. Is there a lesson to be learnt from this? Or do th=
e ghosts of Chernobyl still loom too large?
<br>

<br>
Join me tonight at 10:30pm

emmell, Johann Hari and Sarah Churchwell.=20
<br>

<br>
<b>THE LIVES OF OTHERS</b>=20
<br>

<br>
Our film this week - The Lives of Others - set in Cold War East Berlin, is =
one of the most atmospheric I have ever seen even though it was shot on a t=
iny budget.  In his debut film Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck had access =
to the former Stasi headquarters and even uses original material for props =
like a machine for steaming open 600 letters an hour.=20
<br>

<br>
The Lives of Others picked up various awards including best foreign film Os=
car. It is set - appropriately enough in 1984 - and describes life in a soc=
iety where the Stasi relied on 500,000 to 2,000,000 collaborators as well a=
s 100,000 regular employees and maintained files on approximately 6,000,000=
 East German citizens - more than one-third of the population.=20=20
<br>

<br>
<b>LANDSCAPE WITH WEAPON</b>
<br>

<br>
Landscape with Weapon is the latest play from Joe Penhall at the National T=
heatre in London.  He has explored the ethics of psychiatry in his hit play=
 Blue/Orange, and most recently the media in The Dumb Show. This new play, =
which reunites him with director Roger Michell, explores the moral responsi=
bly of those who work in the arms industry - specifically a designer of wea=
pons.=20=20
<br>

<br>
Tom Hollander plays engineer Ned who has designed an unmanned air vehicle w=
hich could revolutionise warfare, and also make him a lot of money. However=
 what happens if it falls into the wrong hands?   Ned initially defends the=
 need to develop such a weapon with his dentist brother Dan - Julian Rhind-=
Tutt. You may know him from Green Wing. One of our producers certainly does=
 - he's been dubbed Dreamboat in my research notes.=20
<br>

<br>
<b>THE DIARY OF A NOBODY</b>
<br>

<br>
On a much lighter note, we'll also be discussing the TV dramatisation of th=
e book Evelyn Waugh called the funniest ever written - The Diary of a Nobod=
y narrated by the inimitable Mr Pooter.  Pooterish entered the language aft=
er the original Punch sketch in 1888 - the brothers George and Weedon Gross=
mith's satire on the snobberies of suburbia. Can Andrew Davies's version fo=
r BBC Four starring Hugh Bonneville sustain interest for half an hour of mo=
nologue in four parts?=20
<br>

<br>
<b>THEN WE CAME TO THE END by JOSHUA FERRIS</b>
<br>

<br>
It's surprising how few dramas or books are set in the office given how muc=
h time a lot of us spend in one. Ricky Gervais of course led the way recent=
ly with The Office. I once attempted to watch the whole boxed set in one go=
 but found the squirm factor too intense.  Office life is the theme of debu=
t novel from American writer Joshua Ferris which pays homage to great Ameri=
can literary chronicler of Don DeLillo in its title Then We Came to the End=
 which is the first line of DeLillo's own first novel Americana.=20
<br>

<br>
The book is set in a Chicago ad agency and is written in the first person p=
lural: "Our coffee tasted poisonous.  The sight of our familiar chairs oppr=
essed us.  The invariable light was deadening".=20
<br>

<br>
I hope you can join us at 11.
<br>
