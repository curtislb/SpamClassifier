Several readers sent us word of [0]Wal-Mart's ordering 2 million HD DVD
players from China. [1]Hans V wrote, "My kids work at Wal-Mart and the
manager there has been talking about this. HD-DVD's are selling like mad
there so I hear." Another reader sent us a few links in Chinese and
summarized them this way: "The first batches of these blue-laser HD DVD
players are to land sometime in 2007, with complete fulfillment of the
order [from Fuh Yuan] in 2008. The deal could be worth up to $300 million
US, which translates to $150 per player. If so, by the time Christmas
2007 rolls around, Wal-Mart could be selling these for less than $200
retail, although some speculate that the initial manufacturer suggested
retail pricing might be in the ballpark of $299. Currently the cheapest
high-definition player is a Toshiba HD DVD with an MSRP of $399." By
comparison Blu-Ray players, manufactured in Japan, are not expected to
drop below $1000 until next year. The International Herald Tribune writes
about the [2]risk Toshiba is taking by bringing in Chinese manufacturers
to trump Sony in the format war.

[0]NewYorkCountryLawyer writes "In [1]SONY v. Arellanes, an RIAA case in
Sherman, Texas, [2]the Court entered a [3]protective order (PDF) that
spells out the following procedure for the RIAA's examination of the
defendant's hard drive: (1) RIAA imaging specialist makes mirror image of
hard drive; (2) mutually acceptable computer forensics expert makes make
two verified bit images, and creates an MD5 or equivalent hash code; (3)
one mirror image is held in escrow by the expert, the other given to
defendant's lawyer for a 'privilege review'; (4) defendant's lawyer
provides plaintiffs' lawyer with a 'privilege log' (list of privileged
files); (5) after privilege questions are resolved, the escrowed image —
with privileged files deleted — will be turned over to RIAA lawyers, to
be held for 'lawyers' eyes only.' The order differs from the [4]earlier
[5]order (PDF) entered in the case, in that it (a) permits the RIAA's own
imaging person to make the initial mirror image and (b) spells out the
details of the method for safeguarding privilege and privacy."

others may also have been targeted. "Mr. Crookes seems to be [3]'trying
to unwrite history,' Pilling says. 'He was a central figure in the growth
of the Green Party. His actions were highly controversial and if we have
freedom of speech in this country, people should be allowed to talk about
them.'" Newtley adds in a posting submitted 121 minutes later: "Literally
15 minutes after I posted [the foregoing], there was a knock on my door.
It was a writ server telling me I, too, have been [4]named in a lawsuit
launched by Wayne Crookes..."

rm69990 writes "Novell [0]has filed 4 motions for Summary Judgment
against SCO, which essentially ask the court to toss the remainder of
SCO's case that isn't already being arbitrated between SUSE and SCO. One
seeks a ruling from the court that Novell transfered none of the
copyrights in Unix to SCO, which is backed up by many exhibits and
declarations from people who negotiated the deal. Another, along the same
lines, asks the court to toss the portions of SCO's Unfair Competition
and Breach of Contract claims pertaining to the Unix copyrights. The
third asks the court to rule that Novell did not violate the Technology
License Agreement between SCO and Novell, and last and also least, the
fourth seeks to toss the Slander of Title for the additional reason that
SCO has failed to prove any special damages. These motions follow 2
motions for summary judgment filed by Novell late last year on 2 of their
counterclaims."

drug. (Here is an [2]interview with Bolles.) Using the same test kit,
available on the web for $20 for a pack of 10, according to Bolles'
attorney on NBC this morning, other soaps tested positive for GHB. But of
course since it's just soap, when you test it in a real crime lab it
comes back negative. Makes you wonder what other common household
products also test positive, and how many others have been arrested based
on faulty test kits who didn't have the resources to defend themselves."
