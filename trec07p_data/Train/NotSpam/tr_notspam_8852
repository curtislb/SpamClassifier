> We are locked into gtk widgets

Is this because it's been decided that sugar shouldn't have multiple
widget toolkits?
Is this the case even if mozilla can be built with a gtk/cairo backend?

Also, if the current browser activity is written with pygtkmozembed,
what is the meaning of: "Applications can also use xulrunner which
includes Javascript capability." from
http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Web_Browser

Is this what you're talking about:
http://www.mozilla.org/projects/blackwood/webclient/ ?

You said earlier that gtkmozembed exposes nsiWebBrowser.. Is the
problem that this is not exposed to the python gtkmozembed wrapper?
If that's the case, why not improve the wrapper and expose
nsiWebBrowser as a regular python, rather than pyxpcom object?
