AFAICT, THERE IS NO VIOLATION!

Where a licence text accompanies a package it must, as a matter of law, 
be unchangeable.

To take the GPL as an example, where it is not being used as a licence, 
the FSF *HAS* granted you the right to modify it, so there is no problem 
(as regards Debian and *COPYRIGHT*).

The *perceived* problem with the GPL is that the FSF has forbidden 
modified versions to mention the name GPL, the FSF, or carry Richard's 
pre-ramble (sic :-). As far as the names go, that's trademark not 
copyright, and as far as RMS's ramble, to include that would be to 
mis-represent Richard. If that's not against the Social Contract, it 
should be.

Where's the problem? There may be a problem with other licences, but as 
I see it, there is no problem with the GPL (which is being used as an 
example of this alleged problem). AIUI, the OP is confusing the 
unmodifiability of the licence as a matter of licencing law, and the 
default unmodifiability imposed by copyright law (which doesn't apply to 
the GPL, because RMS/FSF have granted permission to modify it, so long 
as you don't break trademark or "passing off" laws in the process).

Cheers,
Wol
