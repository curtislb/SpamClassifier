ORGANIC ALERT: ANOTHER SNEAK ATTACK ON ORGANIC STANDARDS USDA & INDUSTRY TR=
Y TO SNEAK BANNED CONVENTIONAL INGREDIENTS INTO ORGANIC BEER, SAUSAGE, & PR=
OCESSED FOODS=20
The USDA has announced a controversial proposal, with absolutely no input f=
rom consumers, to allow 38 new non-organic ingredients in products bearing =
the "USDA Organic" seal. Most of the ingredients are food colorings derived=
 from plants that are supposedly not "commercially available" in organic fo=
rm. But at least three of the proposed ingredients, backed by beer giant An=
heuser-Busch and pork and food processors, represent a serious threat to or=
ganic standards, and have raised the concerns of the Organic Consumers Asso=
ciation (OCA), as well as a number of smaller organic companies and organic=
 certifiers. Specifically, the OCA disagrees with the "Budweiser exemption,=
" allowing conventionally grown hops, produced with pesticides and chemical=
 fertilizers, to be used in beers labeled as "USDA Organic". Also, OCA stre=
nuously objects to the USDA's proposal to allow the use of conventionally r=
aised factory-farmed animals' intestines (we'll spare you the gory details =
of what thes animals have been fed) as casing for sausages labeled as "orga=
nic." Adding salt to the wound, the USDA has indicated the public comment p=
eriod will not be the standard 30-60 days. Although the USDA has been worki=
ng closely with industry on these proposed changes as far back as 2002, the=
 agency will only be accepting public comments for seven days. Take action =
now and forward this alert to interested friends and colleagues.  Learn mor=
e and sign the OCA petition to the USDA: http://www.organicconsumers.org/ar=
ticles/article_5225.cfm=20

SUSTAINABILITY ALERT: STOP CONGRESS FROM CUTTING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE PR=
OGRAMS=20
Congress is currently putting together the 2007-2012 Farm Bill, a massive b=
ill of taxpayer subsidies and incentives that will have a major impact on f=
ood and farming in the U.S. over the next five years. Next week (May 21), t=
he House Agriculture Subcommittee on Conservation will decide whether to ma=
ke cuts in the Conservation Security Program, an innovative program that he=
lps sustainable and organic farmers protect the environment and preserve we=
tlands. Congress has already cut this program by $4.3 billion and is consid=
ering making further cuts. We need to send a strong message to Washington t=
hat it's time to move our food and farming system away from chemical and en=
ergy-intensive industrial agriculture towards conservation, organic practic=
es, and less dependence on petroleum-based inputs. Contact your Congression=
al Representative now and tell them to please use taxpayers' money wisely b=
y restoring full funding to the Conservation Security Program. Take action:=

UPDATE:=20
CATASTROPHIC BEE COLONY COLLAPSE IS NOT AFFECTING ORGANIC HIVES=20
As previously reported in Organic Bytes (Issue #104), beekeepers in 24 stat=
es are experiencing record losses of honeybees. Some states have reported u=
p to 70% disappearances of commercial bee populations. Researchers are stru=
ggling to find the causes of this mysterious collapse. A crucial element of=
 this story, missing from reports in the mainstream media, is the fact that=
 organic beekeepers across North America are not experiencing colony collap=
ses. The millions of dying bees are hyper-bred varieties whose hives are re=
gularly fumigated with toxic pesticides by conventional beekeepers attempti=
ng to ward off mites. In contrast, organic beekeepers avoid pesticides and =
toxic chemicals and strive to use techniques that closely emulate the ecolo=
gy of bees in the wild. Researchers are beginning to link the mass deaths o=
f non-organic bees to pesticide exposure, genetically modified organisms (G=
MOs), and the common practice of moving conventional bee hives over long di=
stances. Learn more: http://www.organicconsumers.org/bees.cfm

SUSTAINABILITY TIP OF THE WEEK:=20
MORE WAYS TO PREPARE FOR PEAK OIL=20
We began posting Sharon Astyk's insightful tips in our Organic Bytes issue =
#104, which highlighted her first 50 peak oil tips. Here are some excerpts =
from her most recent posting of tips #50 through #100:

52. If your community doesn't have a food coop, start one now. This can be =
a powerful tool for creating local food economies. Here is a downloadable g=
uide to starting your own co-op.

66. Learn basic first aid, herbalism, and any other useful medical informat=
ion you can come by.

94. If others don't seem to be responding to your message or sharing your c=
oncerns, remember that the evidence was there before you saw things too, an=
d that everyone is ready to hear things at a different time.

99. Think of peak oil and the other challenges that face us as an optimizat=
ion exercise - how do I get the most fun, the best life, the most happiness=
, the most love, with the fewest inputs - the least money, the least energy=
, the least waste. Get excited about making it work.

QUOTE OF THE WEEK:  WHEN THE ENTIRE PLANET SHOPS AT WAL-MART
"Worldwide, so many people shop at Wal-Mart that this year 7.2 billion visi=
ts will be made to Wal-Mart stores. Earth's population is only 6.5 billion,=
 so this year the equivalent of every person on the plant will visit a Wal-=
Mart, with more than half a billion visits left over." Charles Fishman, "Th=
e Wal-Mart Effect," 2006=20

HEALTH TIP OF THE WEEK:  100% PURE FRUIT JUICE IS NO LONGER LINKED TO OBESI=
TY
New research presented at the Pediatric Academic Societies' annual conventi=
on in Toronto last week indicates that 100% pure fruit juice does not add t=
o childhood obesity and may actually help children maintain healthy weight.=
 In the their study, researchers analyzed the juice consumption of 3,618 ch=
ildren ages 2 to 11 using data from the National Health and Nutrition Exami=
nation Survey. Increased risk for obesity was linked to beverages that cont=
ained artificial sweeteners like high fructose corn syrup, which makes up t=
he vast majority of beverages on the market (note: most high fructose corn =
syrup is made from genetically engineered corn). "The bottom line is that 1=
00 percent juice consumption is a valuable contributor of nutrients in chil=
dren's diet and it does not have an association with being overweight," sai=
d study chief Dr. Theresa Nicklas.  Learn more: http://www.organicconsumers=
.org/articles/article_5108.cfm=20

PRODUCT PLUNDER OF THE WEEK:  AVOIDING FRUIT JUICE SCAMS
Large beverage manufacturers are notorious for putting labels on their prod=
ucts that mislead consumers into believing that these junk-food drinks are =
pure fruit or else contain more juice than they really have. If you are sho=
pping for 100% pure fruit juice, here's how to avoid getting scammed:

*Always read the ingredient label on the back of the product. If there's an=
ything other than fruit juice in the product, it must be listed there. =20

*"Made with REAL Fruit Juice" could mean it really only has a small percent=
age of fruit juice. =20

*All beverages that imply they contain juice must declare the percentage of=
 juice on the information label near the top of the Nutrition Facts panel. =
=20

*If a product is labeled as Fruit drink, juice beverage, juice cocktail or =
"ade" -- the product is likely full of artificial sweeteners and contains v=
ery little juice. =20

*Oftentimes a "100% juice" product contains juice fillers. Read the ingredi=
ent label, and you'll frequently find your cranberry juice, for example, is=
 mostly apple juice. =20

*Keep in mind that conventional fruits and juices contain pesticide residue=
s, and that industrial scale fruit production is an environmental disaster.=
 Protect your health and the health of the planet by consuming organic frui=
ts and fruit juices.=20

ORGANIC BYTES READERS TALK BACK ALERT:  USDA SAYS ALMONDS LABELED AS 'RAW' =
CAN ACTUALLY BE PASTEURIZED=20

READER'S QUESTION: In Organic Bytes #107 you wrote about the USDA passing a=
 new regulation that will require almonds to be pasteurized even though the=
y may be labeled "raw". I understand the public comment period is over, but=
 I'd still like to let the USDA know how I feel about this. Can you help?

OCA'S RESPONSE: We've received a lot of emails and phone calls from our rea=
ders on this issue. The USDA approved this regulation with little public no=
tification. As a result, the only comments the agency received were from th=
e industrial agriculture lobbyists. One of the FDA-recommended pasteurizati=
on methods requires the use of propylene oxide, which is classified as a "p=
ossible human carcinogen". Organic and family-scale almond farmers are prot=
esting the proposed rule, saying it will effectively put them out of busine=
ss, since the minimum price for the pasteurization equipment is $500,000. W=
e feel this issue is too important to let rest.  Learn more and take action=

WEB VIDEO OF THE WEEK:  SOAP, DRUGS, AND ROCK & ROLL
In a recent bizarre encounter between the punk rock band, The Germs, and la=
w enforcement officials in California, it was discovered that standard fiel=
d drug testing kits could distinguish the difference between soap products =
that are made from natural and organic ingredients and products that may cl=
aim to be organic but really contain synthetic detergents made in part or e=
ntirely from petroleum. Watch this humorous short clip to see if some of yo=
ur favorite so-called natural or organic "soaps" may actually be synthetic.=

ANOTHER WEB VIDEO OF THE WEEK: ORGANIC CONSUMERS ASSOCIATION ON MTV
OCA's Environmental Scientist, Craig Minowa, and his band Cloud Cult were f=
eatured on MTV this week in a piece highlighting efforts to link the enviro=
nmental movement with the music industry. Take a peek at this MTV video to =
see how one of OCA's offices shares space with the world's only environment=
