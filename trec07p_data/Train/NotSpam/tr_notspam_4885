I suggest that you don't use a 3d bar chart.  3d bar charts are
generally hard to interpret for two reasons: large bars will obscure
small bars behind them, and it is very difficult to judge the true
length of the bars. I suggest you try creating a series of 2d bar
charts instead - you are far more likely to be able to interpret them
easily.

For this data, you might also want to look into fluctuation diagrams.
