That's why dwalsh will push a fix tomorrow hopefully.

After the push an updated machine will have no problems.
There are many other things I have been working on to make sane policies
for samba. In FC7 the experience should be much better.
Right now I am running always with SELinux enforcing and 3.0.24 was
perfectly happy after my last week work with Dan on the policies.

If you have any non-working case for FC6/FC7 let me know and I will make
sure policies are updated.

If the machine policies are not updated there are many cases where samba
simply breaks for non trivial configurations, and there is nothing you
can except disabling SELinux if a policy update is refused.

Simo.
