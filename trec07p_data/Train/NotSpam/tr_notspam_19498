7:17 AM, 6/15/07, Update: Russian computers shut down again for more troubl=
eshooting=20

Russian computers aboard the international space station failed to boot up =
properly early today even though they were cut off from U.S. solar array po=
wer. Engineers had speculated that some subtle change in the station's shar=
ed power grid, caused by the installation this week of a new solar array, m=
ight have triggered the Russian computer crashes that have crippled the spa=
ce station. But analysis of the electricity flowing from the new array into=
 the Russian segment of the lab complex did not reveal any obvious "smoking=
 gun" and when the circuit was unplugged, the computers behaved much as the=
y did Thursday.

The station's main command-and-control computer system is made up of three =
redundant machines that can operate in stand-alone mode or as synchronized,=
 fully redundant "lanes." The station's guidance and navigation system is k=
nown as the terminal computer, also made up of three redundant lanes. The c=
omputers normally draw power from the station's shared electrical grid, whi=
ch includes electricity from U.S. solar arrays. The new array channel that =
was routed to the Russian segment earlier this week, roughly when the compu=
ter problems began, is known as power channel 3A.

Russian engineers "performed some more troubleshooting over the last two gr=
ound sites and basically, kind of a repeat of some troubleshooting they did=
 yesterday," said space station flight director Holly Ridings. "If you reme=
mber yesterday, they'd been successful in bringing up the central computer =
and talking to it and getting a command down to the FGB (Zarya module) to g=
et some power over from the U.S. segment to the Russian segment. Unfortunat=
ely ... that computer, the central computer, went off line again.

"And so today's troubleshooting was kind of a repeat of what they did yeste=
rday, trying to turn on the central computer and then the terminal computer=
. And unfortunately, they did get power to both of those computers and get =
good feedback that they were receiving power, briefly had some what they ca=
ll 'availability,' kind of like a heartbeat, on one of the lanes. There are=
 three of them, of the central computer and the computer below it, the term=
inal computer, but were unable to communicate with it properly.

"So on the next ground site after they'd left the power to those computers =
on for about an hour and a half, they decided they would turn the power bac=
k off again and turn what we call an SNT (a Russian acronym pronounced ess-=
en-tay), which is how we send power from the U.S. power system to the Russi=
an segment, back on. So we ended up in the configuration that we started ou=
t the day in, which was, unfortunately not having a central computer or a t=
erminal computer. They're going to let the crew get some sleep ... and put =
together a forward troubleshooting plan."

The computer system has been acting up ever since the Atlantis astronauts a=
ttached a new set of solar arrays to the right side of the station's main p=
ower truss Monday. The terminal computer lanes initially crashed. Then, dur=
ing a programmed reboot of both the terminal and central computer lanes, th=
e entire system hung up.

The navigation system computers are required to fire Russian maneuvering je=
ts to make major changes in the station's orientation. Minor adjustments ar=
e made with U.S. control moment gyroscopes, but that cannot make major chan=
ges and the system periodically has to be reset using rocket control. The s=
tation cannot safely operate without full orientation control to ensure its=
 solar arrays stay face-on to the sun and to prevent sensitive systems from=
 getting too hot or too cold.

The problem is not serious as long as the shuttle Atlantis remains docked b=
ecause the orbiter's thrusters can be used, when needed, to make adjustment=
s that are beyond the ability of the gyros or when the gyro system needs to=
 be reset. But the shuttle will undock and return to Earth next week and th=
e Russians have been working around the clock to get the computer glitches =
resolved before the orbiter departs.

Engineers theorized that the new S4 solar array, or components in the circu=
itry delivering that power to the Russian segment of the station, triggered=
 some subtle change in the lab's electrical grid. The central and terminal =
computers, built in Germany by Daimler-Benz in Germany, are known to be sen=
sitive to "noisy" power.

Late Thursday, outgoing station flier Sunita Williams, her replacement Clay=
 Anderson and flight engineer Oleg Kotov used a signal analyzer to characte=
rize the power flowing from the U.S. to the Russian segment. After that dat=
a was shared with the ground, the system was physically disconnected to mak=
e sure no ground path could be causing problems even with power shut down.

"One of the theories about why this is going on with the computers is that =
there's some interference from the new pieces of the power system that we p=
ut in with the S4 truss and possibly some electromagnetic interference or s=
ome other issue with the power that we're sending them across," Ridings sai=
d.

"So we asked the crew to go in and do some testing with the scope meter on =
the actual power cables that come from the new truss and power channel 3-al=
pha to those SNTs, the boxes that send the U.S. power over to the Russian s=
egment. So they put the scope meter on those cables and looked at the waves=
 ... so all our engineers could go off and assess.

"The engineers looked at that data, they did not find anything that was gro=
ssly off nominal, nothing huge jumped out at them immediately," Ridings sai=
d. "It would have been nice to find a smoking gun, but that's usually not h=
ow these things work."
