						<B>ALAN JOHNSTON</B>
<br>

<br>
Today the world saw a video of the missing BBC journalist Alan Johnston - s=
een for the first time since his capture in Gaza more than two months ago.=
=20
<br>

<br>
In the video, released by the Palestinian jihadist group The Army of Islam,=
 Alan Johnston said he was fit and well, and spoke about the "suffering" of=
 the people in the Palestinian territories, Iraq and Afghanistan, before an=
 unidentified man speaking in Arabic called for the release of "our prisone=
rs."  So how much more do we now know about his captors and what their dema=
nds might be?
<br>

<br>
<B>CHILD PORNOGRAPHY</B>
<br>
=20
<br>
Also tonight, there has been strong reaction to the argument put forward to=
day by a chief police officer in charge of child protection. Jim Gamble, th=
e Chief Executive of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection centre, s=
aid that not all paedophiles should necessarily be sent to prison and they =
should be offered treatment in the community.=20=20
<br>

<br>
He suggested offenders who have committed crimes such as viewing child porn=
ography, rather than sexual assault, could be dealt with this way. Mr Gambl=
e described it as adopting a "much more intelligent posture" and "engaging =
with the predator". Tonight a man convicted and imprisoned for downloading =
child pornography - and a woman who was abused by several paedophiles - deb=
ate.=20
<br>

<br>
<B>BLAIR IN SOUTH AFRICA</B>
<br>
=20
<br>
Tony Blair's Farewell World Tour hit South Africa today where he spoke to T=
habo Mbeki about Zimbabwe - praising the South African president's efforts.=
 It was his big chance to lay it on the line over Robert Mugabe.  So why di=
dn't he?
<br>
=20
<br>
<B>ENGLAND FRIENDLY</B>
<br>

<br>
And ... Beckham's back to play in the first England international at the ne=
w Wembley stadium.  We'll review the big friendly with Brazil.=20=20=20

					<b>DAMIEN HIRST SPECIAL</b>
<br>
=20
<br>
And then on a special edition of Newsnight Review, an in depth exclusive in=
terview with the man who today produced a diamond and platinum skull expect=
ed to fetch 50 million pounds. At nine o'clock sharp this morning, the arti=
st Damien Hirst revealed the most expensive piece of art by a living artist=
, at his latest and largest exhibition - Beyond Belief - at the White Cube =
Galleries in London.=20
<br>

<br>
For The Love of God - the name he has given to a platinum cast of a human s=
kull set with more than 8000 diamonds, cost an astonishing 14 million pound=
s to make and is expected to fetch 50 million dollars. We have extraordinar=
y pictures of the skull which you might call beautiful, obscene, or morbid =
according to your point of view.=20
<br>

<br>
Throughout his career Damien Hirst has been the object of intense scrutiny,=
 and knows how to make a splash. It began with Freeze, the 1988 show he cur=
ated while he was still a student at Goldsmiths in London. That show put Hi=
rst and his fellow students - Sarah Lucas, Gary Kemp and Angus Fairhurst - =
on the map.
<br>

<br>
Hirst created some of the iconic art works that defined the 1990s including=
 his series of animals in formaldehyde, and his series of spots, spins, but=
terflies and animals in vitrines. Much of it was bought by the collector Ch=
arles Saatchi whose patronage of young British artists led to what was know=
n as Brit art.=20
<br>

<br>
Hirst won the Turner Prize in 1995 and he became the self styled enfant ter=
rible of the art world - his legendary excess drew as much if not more atte=
ntion than his art.=20
<br>

<br>
Around him is a team of more than a hundred people who produce his artworks=
, and oversee his many business projects, from restaurants to his pursuit o=
f a world class art collection - which include some of his artistic heroes =
Bacon, Warhol and Koons, as well as contemporaries and emerging artists.
<br>

<br>
Hirst calls his new show a collection of greatest hits - there are butterfl=
ies and vitrines including the terrifying St Sebastian as well as two serie=
s of paintings - the brand new biopsy paintings of cancer cells and the fac=
t paintings featuring the birth by caesarean section of Damien's third son =
Cyrus.
<br>

<br>
But the piece that has attracted all the media attention is For the Love of=
 God.
<br>

<br>
Tune in to see it at 11pm.
