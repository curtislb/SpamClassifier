Peter Pitts doesn't like the KSR decision, and he also doesn't like
prizes.  His recent Spectator article (text below) says:

      *"DISTURBINGLY, SOME FOLKS ARE now advocating a "prize" system
where there are no drug patents. Instead, the government would pay a
drug maker a lump sum for its innovation, and then the new drug would
immediately be placed in the public domain."

Actually, most proposals for prizes would have the rewards be paid
out over time, based upon evidence of the benefits of the
inventions.   For example, over a 10 year period in the Sanders
bill.  The relationship between the patent system and prizes is also
more nuanced.  The Sanders bill and the approaches by several prize
supporters would retain the granting of patents, but not give the
patent owner an exclusive right to manufacture and sell the product,
eliminating the monopoly, but providing for cash rewards.

In a related front, today a key WHO World Health Assembly committee
approved this language,

"(4) to encourage the development of proposals for health-needs
driven research and development for discussion at the
Intergovernmental Working Group that includes a range of incentive
mechanisms, also addressing the linkage between paying for the cost
of R&D and the prices of medicines, vaccines, dx tools and other
health care products, and a method for tailoring the optimal mix of
incentives to a particular condition or product, with the objective
of addressing diseases that disproportionately affect developing
countries;"

The language on the "linkage between paying for the cost of R&D and
the prices of medicines" was proposed by Switzerland, as a restating
of Brazil's earlier language on the same topic.

The American Spectator
Is Chunky Monkey an Obvious Combination?
By Peter Pitts
Published 5/23/2007 12:07:14 AM

Earlier this month, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled to make
it more difficult to invalidate a patent. Essentially, the court
decided that "obvious" combinations of previous inventions do not
warrant protection under U.S. patent law.

The case before the high court was KSR International Co. v. Teleflex
Inc. The dispute was over a patent for gas pedals. Teleflex had
combined two existing inventions -- an electronic throttle control
and an adjustable pedal. The Court ruled that this was too obvious a
combination to warrant protection under a new patent.

Unfortunately, the court's ruling will have implications that go far
beyond gas pedals. Namely, it will stifle innovation in the
pharmaceutical industry -- which, ultimately, will have a negative
impact on the future of public health.

According to Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wrote the majority opinion,
"Granting patent protection to advances that would occur in the
ordinary course without real innovation retards progress and
may...deprive prior inventions of their value or utility."

At first glance, that seems to be somewhat reasonable -- for things
like gas pedals. The problem is, 21st century medicine has very
little in common with automobile parts.

In medical innovation today, there are precious few "Eureka!"
moments. Progress is made step-by-step, one incremental innovation at
a time. Those advances require extensive research. And they're
terrifically expensive. On average, it takes nearly a billion dollars
to bring a new drug to market.

But this slow, steady progress is how today's medical advances are
made -- not through Hollywood-style "Aha!" moments so popular with
politicians and pundits.


NEVERTHELESS, GENERIC DRUG MAKERS routinely challenge the patents of
name-brand drug makers in court, claiming that they're too obvious to
warrant patent protection.

It's far cheaper for generic companies to wage these legal battles
than invent the drugs themselves. If they win, they can reap the
benefits of the hundreds of millions worth of research that a name-
brand company spent developing the drug. If the drug is denied patent
protection, generic companies move in to reproduce low-cost copies of
the same molecular combinations.

The downside, of course, is that the name-brand companies cannot
recoup their R&D costs if their patents aren't upheld. As a result,
they will have less incentive to invest in developing new drugs in
the future.

The high court's ruling will make pharmaceutical innovation more
difficult by reducing the incentive for companies to make small steps
forward. If the courts don't recognize the concept of incremental
innovation as worthy of patent protection, investors simply won't pay
for it.

And if investors won't pay because there's no profit motive, name-
brand companies will be unable to pursue incremental advances.

If the current system collapses, what's the alternative? Who will pay
drug companies to invent new drugs?


DISTURBINGLY, SOME FOLKS ARE now advocating a "prize" system where
there are no drug patents. Instead, the government would pay a drug
maker a lump sum for its innovation, and then the new drug would
immediately be placed in the public domain.

This is unlikely to work. The government "prize" model has already
been used in the past -- in the old Soviet Union. And it was a
spectacular disaster. The Soviet experience was characterized by low
levels of monetary compensation and poor innovative performance.

There's also the problematic issue of how such a sum would be
determined.

The United States government does not have a good track record when
it comes to rewarding inventors.

For example, the federal government paid Robert Goddard -- "the
father of American rocketry" -- $1 million as compensation for his
basic liquid rocket patents. That was hardly a fair price given that
during the remaining life of those patents, U.S. expenditures on
liquid-propelled rockets amounted to around $10 billion.

Even though the "prize" system is widely acknowledged to be a
crackpot idea, it has a frightening number of supporters in high
places -- including the U.S. Senate.

In fact, Sen. Bernie Sanders is introducing federal legislation to
create a prize system for medical innovations. Leave it to the
senator from Vermont to come up with a Ben & Jerry's-style solution.

If only inventing the cure for cancer were as easy as dreaming up a
new flavor of ice cream.


Peter J. Pitts is president of the Center for Medicine in the Public
Interest and a former FDA associate commissioner.
