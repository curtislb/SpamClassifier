[0]newtley writes "Fake cops employed by the RIAA started acting like
real police officers quite a while ago — one of the earliest examples
unfolded in Los Angeles in 2004. From a distance, the bust, '[1]looked
like classic LAPD, DEA or FBI work, right down to the black "raid" vests
the unit members wore,' said the LA Weekly. That their yellow stenciled
lettering read 'RIAA' instead of something from an official
law-enforcement agency, 'was lost on 55-year-old parking-lot attendant
Ceasar Borrayo.' But it's also SOP for the RIAA to wield genuine officers
paid for entirely from citizen taxes as copyright cops. [2]Police were
used in an RIAA-inspired raid at two flea markets in Beaverton, Oregon.
'Sgt. Paul Wandell, Beaverton police spokesman, said officers seized more
than 50,000 items worth about $758,000,' says The Oregonian. But this is
merely the tiny tip of an iceberg of [3]absolutely staggering dimensions,
an example of the extent coming in a GrayZone report slugged [4]RIAA
Anti-Piracy Seizure Information."

[0]coondoggie writes "Looking to address critics, the US Patent and
Trademark Office this week is starting a program to speed up and
[1]improve the review of computer hardware and software technologies. The
agency is set to launch a peer-review pilot project that will give
technical experts in computer technology, for the first time, the
opportunity to submit technical reports relevant to the claims of a
published patent application before an examiner reviews it. The idea is
to get as much knowledge about a particular claim in front of an examiner
as quickly as possible so they can make a decision faster, the agency
said. IBM, Microsoft, General Electric, Hewlett-Packard, CA, and Red Hat
have already agreed to review some software patent applications for the
one-year community review project. Intel, Sun, Oracle, Yahoo, and others
are also part of the project. The pilot is a joint initiative with the
Community Patent Review Project, organized by the New York Law School's
Institute for Information and Policy.

an underlying network of vessels — similar to blood capillaries — that
carry a healing agent to areas on the material's surface that sustain
damage. Unlike previous self-healing systems that relied on capsules of
agent buried in the polymer and which became depleted after one use, the
new system can respond to damage at the same point many times over."

An anonymous reader writes "Michael Geist's latest Toronto Star column
features a behind-the-scenes look at [0]how Canada got its movie piracy
bill based on internal government documents obtained under the Access to
Information Act. Few will be shocked to learn that Hollywood lobbyists
provided draft legislation months earlier as part of their [1]barrage of
lobbying, though the documents show that advisers to the Minister were
skeptical that the proposal would accomplish anything. From the article:
'The industry's lobby efforts were clearly successful. Ignoring the
inconsistent claims, the absence of evidence that Canadian films are
being affected, the contrary internal advice, and the bracing reality
that Hollywood has acknowledged that the U.S. is by far the largest
source of illegal camcording worldwide notwithstanding its movie piracy
legislation, Bill C-59 is expected to sail through Parliament. In doing
so, Ottawa is sending Canadians two messages. The first is what drew the
industry standing ovation - unauthorized camcording will not be tolerated
in Canada even if it means diverting law enforcement resources from
health and safety issues to movie theatres. The second is that private
meetings, foreign pressures and lobbyist drafted bills is how law gets
made in Canada.'"

addition to these four states, members of the Idaho legislature

accumulated, several fairly contorted and unsatisfying efforts have been
aimed at solving the puzzle. Cramer has proposed an explanation that
doesn't violate the speed of light but does kind of mess with the

+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, a ... company called Wizards
of the Coast abandoned Star Wars fans who enjoyed their tabletop
roleplaying game to an awful fate: product death. The Star Wars d20
product line, which saw print from 2000 to late 2004, attempted to
capture the epic adventure that is the Star Wars setting within a simple
quantifiable ruleset. Unfortunately, the d20 rules (circa 2000) were far
too clumsy to make the RPG 'feel' like Star Wars. Even a 2002 Revised
Core Rules book did little to create an intuitive play experience. Now,
in time for the setting's 30th anniversary, Wizards has released a brand
new edition of the rules, marking a relaunch of the product line. Dubbed
the 'Saga Edition', it has completely revamped the d20 rules to meet with
demands for Star Warsyness. Read on for a review of the changes, which
may finally bring the fun to the galaxy far, far away.

accusing the telecom of cheaping out on maintenance in Virginia due to
its preoccupation with its FiOS network. Ars covers the fracas and
[1]gives more time to Verizon than the local media do. From Ars: 'During
testimony given before the Virginia State Corporation Commission last
week... workers painted a dire picture of the state of Verizon's copper
network, saying that the equipment required to make repairs — including
tools and cable — is not even available.' Verizon disagrees, saying that
while it's a challenge to manage and maintain both networks, they are not
neglecting their copper infrastructure." A union official gave written
testimony about the Verizon problems, presumably so that individual
workers would not have to testify in public and open themselves to
retribution.

iPhoneLover/Hater writes "Gizmodo is running an article analyzing the
potential [0]failure of the iPhone as a truly revolutionary platform. The
reason: no SDK to harness the true power of Mac OS X and the frameworks
contained in Apple's smart cell. From the article: 'According to Apple,
"no software developer kit is required for the iPhone." However, the
truth is that the lack of an SDK means that there won't be a killer
application for the iPhone. It also means the iPhone's potential as an
amazing computing and communication platform will never be realized. And
because of this and no matter how Apple tries to sell it, the iPhone
won't make a revolution happen.'"

greenbird writes "Another patent fiasco has begun. Wired reports that a
[0]patent on location-based Internet searches was filed in 1996 and
granted in 1999 ([1]patent is here). A patent troll company name Geomas
acquired the patent and has filed suit against Verizon in none other than
[2]Marshall, Texas. They claim this is the first in what will be a long
line of lawsuits. Geomas has amassed a $20M war chest in venture capital
to use for getting rich off of a clearly obvious idea."

Several notes about Google and privacy. First, [0]Lucas123 informs us
that Google's global privacy counsel blogged about an [1]improvement in
Google's data-retention policies: the company plans to anonymize data it
stores about users after 18 months — a slight improvement on the "18 to
24 months" of the previous policy. This move may have come as a response
to pressure from European regulators. Next, [2]Spamicles sends in word
that an EFF attorney has been [3]photographed by Google's Street View.
The funny thing is, this isn't the [4]first time it's happened. Finally,
word from reader tamar that if you choose to share a video from Google
Video to another social network like MySpace, [5]your username and
password get sent over http in plaintext, rather than the more secure
https.

AtomicSnarl writes "When Carlisle, PA, police noticed their traffic stop
was being videotaped, they [0]arrested the fellow with the camera for
felony wiretapping. From the story: 'Kelly is charged under a state law
that bars the intentional interception or recording of anyone's oral
conversation without their consent... An exception to the wiretapping law
allows police to film people during traffic stops.. [An assistant DA]
said case law is in flux as to whether police can expect not to be
recorded while performing their duties.'"
