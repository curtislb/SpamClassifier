Cabot Wealth Advisory - The Education Issue

Mother's Day

Look At Your Charts!

My Favorite Education Stock

Everyone's got a mother.  It's a fact of life.  And tomorrow is Mother's
Day.  But much as I would like to, I won't be bringing gifts, cards or
even wishes to my mother -- and for a good reason.

She's on vacation in England at a traditional jazz festival with my
father.  I believe it's their eighth pilgrimage to this event, where they
renew acquaintances with fellow jazz lovers -- mostly from Europe.  And
I'm sure they're having a great time.

So, on the occasion of Mother's Day, I'd like to share a few thoughts
about my mother and one of her greatest qualities -- her love of
learning.

My mother had no opportunity to attend college when she was young.   
It simply wasn't part of her family's culture.  She was married at 19, and
spent the next few decades raising five children.  Every one of them
completed college, but what is more impressive is that once the youngest
was out of the way, my mother herself began attending college and
eventually earned her own bachelor's degree.

For years, she had a quotation about learning taped near the phone at
home.  It comes from the quartet of novels, "The Once and Future King," by
Terence Hanbury White, and consists of advice from the wizard Merlyn as he
is instructing young Arthur (the future king).

"The best thing for being sad," replied Merlyn, beginning to puff and
blow, "is to learn something. That is the only thing that never fails. You
may grow old and trembling in your anatomies, you may lie awake at night
listening to the disorder of your veins, you may miss your only love, you
may see the world about you devastated by evil lunatics, or know your
honour trampled in the sewers of baser minds. There is only one thing for
it then -- to learn. Learn why the world wags and what wags it. That is
the only thing which the mind can never exhaust, never alienate, never be
tortured by, never fear or distrust, and never dream of regretting."

When you're a kid and see the same message taped by the phone year after
year, it tends to sink in.  At least it did with me.

And my mother lived those words.  For example, she had learned to play the
piano as a child, and my father was -- and is -- an accomplished
clarinetist.  Together they make beautiful music together, literally.  But
a piano is far from portable.  So at an age when many people have long
stopped learning, she learned to play the accordion, so she could
accompany my father on the clarinet anywhere.  No doubt they're playing in
England this weekend!

And the learning goes on.  I've written about my daughter's semester of
study in China, and that's a great learning experience for a college
student.  But leave it to my mother to pin a giant map of China on the
kitchen wall so she can follow her granddaughter's travels around the
Middle Kingdom!

So, here's to learning, which is almost as important as mothers!

Interestingly, the first national Mother's Day in the United States,
declared by Woodrow Wilson, was celebrated in 1914.  Originally conceived
as a call for peace and disarmament, it was watered down to honor mothers
whose sons had died in war.  But just nine years later (!), it had become
so commercialized that the movement's main advocate protested what it had
become.  And we tend to think that commercialization is a modern
characteristic of our society!  Today, the NRA (the National Restaurant
Association) says Mother's Day is the most popular day of the year for
dining at a restaurant.

Grow 50% or Pay Nothing!

When Intuitive Surgical represented the best growth story on Wall Street
in August 2004, we quickly named it Stock of the Month. Since then it's
handed investors 600% gains.

When we could see that Apple Computer's earnings momentum was shooting
through the roof in October 2004, we named it Stock of the Month. It was
selling for a shockingly low $35 per share. Today, (adjusted for a 2-for-1
split) it has turned a $10,000 investment into $43,000.

When the rest of Wall Street felt that Google's best days were behind in
July 2005, our research said the tear would continue. Six months after we
named it Stock of the Month, my readers saw the stock gain an incredible
$160 a share.

There are 16 more Stocks of the Month I could name that have handed us an
88% average profit per stock over the past two years...

One of the trademarks of our Cabot style is that we attempt to educate you
as we inform and advise.  Ideally, you don't just get good advice from us;
you become, over time, a wiser and better investor yourself.  The old
proverb about the fish and all.

So today, some advice about selling.  Selling is the hardest part of
investing, especially for amateur investors.  They tend to hang on to
stocks too long.  And why?  One, because they have trouble changing their
original conclusion, that the stock and company are a good investment. 
And two, because they're not watching their stocks on a regular basis.

If you find yourself in the latter camp, do yourself a favor by setting up
your computer so that you're almost forced to look at those charts every
day.

Yahoo! offers an excellent page that you can customize to show all the
stocks you're interested in, and the web page of your online broker almost
certainly offers similar capability.  What you want is a page that can
show you at a glance the charts of all the stocks you own.

And then make that page your start-up page.  Or, if your browser supports
a tabbed presentation (personally, I think tabbed browsing is the coolest
innovation in years), make that chart page one of the tabs on your default
tab group.

The goal?  To force yourself to look at the charts of the stocks you own
every day.  If you do, you'll learn to love the stocks that go up and
you'll (hopefully) become less enamored of those that go down.   
Ideally, you'll learn to sell those that go down, and move on the greener
pastures.  (If you're still holding Ballard Power (BLDP), JDS Uniphase
(JDSU), Mesa Air (MESA) or Whole Foods Market (WFMI), all of whom graced
this week's list of stocks hitting new lows, you should sell.)

Note: Keeping an eye on your stocks' progress is especially important if
you buy a stock that I recommend here but you don't subscribe to the
publication that will tell you when to sell.

Finally, sticking to the theme of education, I have a great growth stock
for you.  But first, a little background.

Years ago, Apollo Group (APOL) was a great growth stock.  Apollo runs
colleges and other education programs (both online and in physical
classrooms) that serve the needs of working adults.  The Cabot Market
Letter's model portfolio owned the stock for 14 months in 2002 and 2003
and did well, earning a 52% profit.  The stock went even higher in 2004,
but it then fell 65% from its peak, a perfect example of what happens to a
well-loved stock when the tide changes.  The trouble?  Earnings growth
slowed . . . and quality fell, too, as the school stretched to meet Wall
Street's expectations.  APOL may have bottomed last November, but the
company's -- and the stock's -- best growth days are over. 
(Interestingly, founder and Executive Chairman John Sperling, who was a
great stem-winder in the company's early years, is now 86 years old.)

So I have a new fast-growing education company for you.  Call it the
follow-on to Apollo.  It's based in China.  It operates schools that teach
English and other useful subjects.  And it's growing like the wind, thanks
to the efforts of its own dynamic stem-winder, founder and CEO, Michael
Minhong Yu.

Here's what Paul Goodwin wrote about the company recently in Cabot China &
Emerging Markets Report.

"New Oriental Education & Technology Group (EDU) was founded in 1993 with
one location in Beijing.  It now has 25 schools in 24 Chinese cities and
has recorded over three million student enrollments since its founding. 
In addition to the company's 25 schools, its more than 4,000 teachers and
staff offer classes in 110 learning centers, 13 company-owned bookstores
and over 5,000 third-party bookstores.  And its online learning network
has about two million registered users, to boot.

The company offers a wide range of courses in many fields, but the
dominant interest in China is learning English: of the 872,000 student
enrollments in fiscal 2006, nearly 500,000 were for language training, and
95% of the language classes were for English.  New Oriental's English
language programs are keyed to kids as young as 5 and to adults of all
ages.  The teaching of English is widespread in China and proficiency is
part of the testing regime for admission to colleges and universities,
which makes the company's immersive, intensive programs a valuable key to
future educational possibilities.  Instruction is also available in
German, Japanese, French, Korean and Spanish.

Test preparation is another important curriculum for New Oriental. Test
scores can determine access to educational institutions in China, the U.S.
and the Commonwealth countries, and of the more than 375,000 enrollments
in the company's test preparation courses in fiscal 2006, 254,000 were for
tests within the People's Republic and 121,000 were for tests to be taken
outside of China.

New Oriental Education is very much the brain-child of Michael Minhong Yu
. . .  His vision for the company is idealistic ("Hew a stone of hope out
of a mountain of despair, and you can make your life a splendid one."),
but it's also very ambitious.  The company has moved rapidly into online
education, selling pre-paid online education cards to distributors who
re-sell them to students.  Of the two million registered online users
mentioned above, about 200,000 have paid for additional access to
specialized programs.  Back in the bricks-and-mortar world, the company
established a full-time primary and secondary school in Yanhzhou.  This
private boarding school for kids in grades 1 through 12 has a capacity of
4,000 students, and offers a full curriculum in both Chinese and English.

. . .for the company's fiscal third quarter (ending February 28), total
net revenues increased 57% year-over-year, and net income topped $8
million, which exceeded the high end of estimates.  The company also
issued positive guidance for the rest of the year."

New Oriental Education & Technology Group was trading at 45 when Paul
wrote that a few weeks ago.  Since then it's climbed to 50 and pulled back
to 48.  And I like it, because I'm a big proponent of education, because I
believe in the growth of China going forward, and because I know what a
man like Michael Yu can do.
