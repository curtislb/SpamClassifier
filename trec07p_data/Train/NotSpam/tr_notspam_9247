Cabot Wealth Advisory - Good News and Bad News

The Strongest Bull Market I've Seen In Years!

How Long Can The U.S. Remain Number One?

A Great Investment Opportunity In Chinese Diesels

==

The good news is that we remain in a rip-roaring bull market, the
strongest that I've seen in many years, and there are no signs that it is
near an end.  Market breadth is terrific, interest rates are low and
sentiment is not exuberant.  It's a great time to make money, and I will
discuss some favorite stocks later on.

But first I want to step back and take a look at where we are today in the
U.S. from a very long-term perspective.  And therein lies the bad news.

This story of the U.S. begins . . . in most accounts . . . with the
arrival of the Mayflower in Plymouth, Massachusetts in 1620.  You could
argue that I should begin with the arrival of the Jamestown, Virginia
settlers in 1607 or Christopher Columbus in 1492 or Leif Ericson in 1000
or even the Native Americans who emigrated from Asia long before.

But I'm telling the story so that's where I'll start . . . in part because
I recently read the book "Mayflower" by Nathaniel Philbrick . . . and then
heard the man speak at a lecture.   
"Mayflower" is an exhaustively researched book, focusing not just on that
well-publicized landing, or the first winter, when half the colonists
died, but on the numerous difficulties encountered in the subsequent 55
years.  The book features hardship and courage in abundance.  But there's
also selfishness, deceit and plain old double-crossing.

And the Native Americans were everywhere, often cooperating with the
colonists in exchange for material goods, but sometimes resisting when
their demands grew onerous.  As the decades passed, and the white man's
appetite for land grew, tensions increased.  Finally, in 1675, King
Philip, son of Massasoit (who had befriended the Pilgrims in 1621), fought
back, and the result was King Philip's War, which in the course of a year
brought the deaths of some 600 colonists and 3,000 Native Americans.

It was another century until the United States was formed and broke free
from England, and another century and three-quarters until the U.S. become
the world's largest economy.

The reasons for that achievement are well know.  Abundant natural
resources, freedom, immigration of motivated people, capitalism, and an
attitude that recognized the growth potential inherent in those assets. 
Today, the U.S. is still the #1 economy in the world, some three times
larger than #2 Japan.  But the gap is shrinking, in part because the
natural resources are running out (we can no longer just push on
westward).

But the picture is far more complex than that, and this brings me to Kevin
Phillips, the erstwhile Republican strategist who has written several
books and who spoke in Salem this past weekend to promote his latest book,
published last year, "American Theocracy."

At first glance, it's a book that critiques President Bush and his
cohorts, and that by itself is unremarkable; there are plenty of those. 
But this one is of interest because it comes from a man who formerly
worked in the upper levels of the Republican Party.  And when I learn that
an intelligent man - after rational consideration - has switched his
allegiance, I pay attention.  It's a rare man or woman who is open-minded
enough to do that!

But I don't want to get into Bush today.  I want to focus on the theme
that Mr. Phillips highlights in the new, updated introduction to his book,
a theme he spent considerable time on during his speech.

The theme: the U.S. is nearing the end of its position as the leading
economic force in the world, and the decades ahead will be increasingly
difficult because of this loss of power.

Now, this is a theme I've considered before; even a cursory knowledge of
history as taught in school reveals that all previous world powers have
eventually ceded the leadership baton to someone else, and suggests that
the U.S. is likely to follow the same path.

Mr. Phillips, however, described specific characteristics of our current
position in the U.S. and discussed how these are similar to conditions that
existed when previous world powers were at their peaks.

The old leaders are Rome, Spain, Holland and England, and the
characteristics that marked their peaks are in some ways varied, but in
many ways the same.  So here they are.

1. A popular sense of national decay, economic, moral or patriotic.   
(Why have there been calls to impeach our last two presidents?)

2.  An intensification of religion.  (If we truly have separation of
church and state, why has no member of Congress had the courage to admit
that he or she is an atheist?)

3.  Conflict between faith and science.  (Teaching creationism in schools
as an alternative to evolution?)

4.  Imperialism and military overreach  (Iraq?)

5.  The burden of excessive debt.  (Why is our national debt $8.8
trillion?)

6.  The decline of industry and the rise of finance.  (Are hedge funds
really better for us than GE and GM?)

So there you have it.  Of course, the future is not written in stone. 
Anything is possible.  (These are the same words I use in discussing the
future of individual stocks; it's all probability.)   
But I do respect Mr. Phillips' reasoning.  I'm of the school that says,
"History doesn't repeat, but it rhymes."  It happens with individual
stocks and I see no reason why it shouldn't happen with individual
countries, as well.

In fact, there's a passage in our "Momentum System 1000," which is
distributed to all readers of the Cabot Market Letter, which reads, "All
living things have life cycles.  They grow, mature and then finally die. 
We see this all around us in many different forms: in flowers, animals,
trees and people.  But we also see it in organizations.  Organizations are
born, they grow and mature.  They develop strengths and weaknesses for a
variety of reasons.  Some, like political organizations, metamorphose
slowly from year to year.   
Even countries go through life cycles ....  But any organization, even a
country, can die if it's not managed properly!"

Those words were first written in 1975, and there's no way my father was
thinking of the U.S. when he wrote them.  And I'm certainly not saying the
U.S. will die.  But when you weigh the growing economic might of China and
India and the slowing growth of the U.S., it's not hard to conclude that
we will likely slip to #2 at some point in the decades ahead.

Knowing this possibility, what do you do?

Perhaps nothing.  After all, whether Mr. Phillips is right or not, the sun
will continue to rise every day, your children (or parents) will still
need your attention, and working on things you have control over can be
more rewarding than worrying about things over which you have little
control.

But maybe you look a little more closely at investments outside the U.S.,
particularly in the fast-growing BRIC countries.  (That's Brazil, Russia,
India and China.)

In any event, it's food for thought.

How Does Cabot Pick Emerging Markets Stocks?

Paul Goodwin, editor of Cabot China & Emerging Markets Report, looks for
promising companies benefiting from the rapid growth in the economies of
the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China). They must also meet
strict criteria regarding fundamentals and technicals. These
recommendations will have healthy balance sheets and will show solid
growth.

Visit the link below to see the explosive profits from the fast-growing
opportunities Paul recommends. See how $5,000 can soar to $10,000,
$15,000, $25,000-or more-over the next two to three years.

And now back to the market, which is strong as a bull, healthy as a horse
and climbing like a homesick angel into new-high territory day after day. 
The advance-decline line is strong, there are no divergences, and
sentiment is still not euphoric!  Bottom line: I expect the market to
continue this incredible ascent.

And if you're not fully invested yet?

Well, you know I love solar power stocks.  They had a brief pullback early
last week, but the selling volume wasn't convincing.   
Furthermore, several of the stocks I've been watching stopped their
decline right at the 50-day moving average, giving a classic technical
short-term buy signal.  So I added one more solar stock to the portfolio
of the Cabot Market Letter.

But I don't want to talk about that today.  I want to talk about a new
name, one that may suit your portfolio if you're looking to diversify
outside the U.S.   The industry is transportation.  We all know that GM
and Ford are sick because of high labor and health care costs.  And we all
know that the Chinese are fast trading in their bicycles for automobiles.  But
it's hard to find a direct investment there, because Chinese automakers
Chery and Geely don't trade on major U.S. exchanges yet.

But China Yuchai Diesel (CYD) does.  It trades on the New York Exchange,
and it was recommended by Paul Goodwin, editor of Cabot China & Emerging
Markets Report, in last week's issue.  Here's some of what he wrote."

"China Yuchai (CYD) is one of the top three manufacturers of light-,
medium- and heavy-duty diesel engines in China . . . With an R&D budget of
more than $3 million a year, plus an in-house R&D staff of more than 100,
the company is working hard to improve the efficiency and environmental
friendliness of its engines.  This is important for two reasons.  First,
the Eurozone markets have strict requirements for all diesel engines, both
imported and domestic, and many of China Yuchai's engines are already
approved for sale there.  And second, as China's own environmental
conditions become more of an issue, China Yuchai wants to be well
positioned to meet any additional emissions requirements that the
government imposes."

So technology is on the company's side as it works to supply the diesel
engines needed both in and out of China.  But this is not a pure growth
story, as are most of Paul's Chinese stocks; this is actually a turnaround
story!

Paul wrote, "CYD, which had traded in the low single digits for years,
caught a wave in 2002, rising from 1 at the beginning of the year to 30
near the end of 2003.  But after that, the stock (and the company's
profits) started a downtrend that didn't end until the stock bottomed out
3 1/2 years later back at 4.5.  Since that low in July 2006, CYD has
worked its way back."

What I like about it is that it still looks like a good value!  China
Yuchai saw revenues of $871 million last year, but the stock's market
capitalization is just $376 million.  In the fourth quarter of last year,
revenues grew at a 56% rate, and that's probably unsustainable.  But a 20%
rate looks easily attainable.  And profit margins of 3% to 5% shouldn't be
hard to achieve either.

Of course, there are risks.  One is the Chinese government, which can
change the rules of the game at any time.  Two is the stock's relatively
low liquidity; average daily trading volume is 200,000 shares.  And three
is the stock's low price.  Generally, the lower the price, the higher the
risk.  (That low price also means quicker rewards are possible.)

When Paul recommended this stock last week it was trading at 9.   
Today it's at 10.  Part of that advance may be due to Paul's
recommendation; it's hard to tell.  My suggestion: if you're interested,
wait to buy until the stock's next small correction is over.
