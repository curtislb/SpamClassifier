<strong>IRAQ EXPECTED TO BE HOT TOPIC IN TONIGHT'S DEBATE: </strong>What will New Hampshire voters be listening for when 18 presidential hopefuls square off next week in two presidential debates? It depends on who you ask, but on one issue, there is widespread agreement: People want to hear about Iraq. "Certainly, they want to hear about the war," said New Hampshire state Sen. Lou D'Allesandro, a Manchester Democrat. "What is your position on the war? Where are we going with regard to the war? More and more servicemen are dying everyday, and people are seeing that. "[The war] is close because of the number of National Guard people there," said D'Allesandro, who has not yet endorsed a candidate. "You are witnessing your friends and neighbors passing away or being killed." CNN.com:  War front-and-center as candidates prepare for debates
http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/06/02/nh.debates/index.html

<strong>TIER 2 CANDIDATES LOOK TO GRANITE STATE TO BREAK THROUGH:</strong> Every presidential candidate sees New Hampshire as a critical state, but for Democratic candidates looking a breakthrough, the Granite State is the political land of hope and possibility. "New Hampshire voters are open, they're keeping their power dry," New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson told reporters in Concord, New Hampshire, Saturday morning. "They take their first-in-the-nation seriously and they want to see every candidate up front." The chance to shake one more set of New Hampshire hands and make one more first impression pushed several presidential candidates to spend the first half of Saturday in Concord at the state's Democratic Party convention before flying out to Iowa for an evening political dinner.

http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/06/02/nh.candidates/index.html

<strong>WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN CANDIDATES SQUARE OFF: </strong>What do you get when you mix four hours of prime-time television coverage spread over two nights, a few hundred New Hampshire voters, and 17 men and one woman who want to be the next president? Well, it’s a good thing “American Idol’’ just ended, because CNN and WMUR-TV wouldn’t want to compare their Nielsen ratings against that hit reality-TV series. But the earliest broadcast debates in recent New Hampshire primary history start today with at least some voter anticipation. WMUR, CNN and the New Hampshire Union Leader are sponsoring and producing these debates, with eight Democratic hopefuls going at it today and 10 GOP candidates taking their turn on Tuesday. Both debates begin at 7 p.m. Nashua Telegraph: What to expect when candidates square off

<strong>DEMS WARM UP FOR NEW HAMPSHIRE DEBATE IN IOWA:</strong> Democratic presidential hopefuls warmed up for Sunday's big debate by trying to impress about 1,000 activists at the Iowa Democratic Party's Hall of Fame dinner on Saturday. The lineup included New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards, New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, Connecticut Sen. Christopher Dodd and Delaware Sen. Joe Biden. The evening's speeches touched mainly on the war in Iraq, health care and renewable energy, with plenty of barbs aimed at the Bush administration. "It is time for the president of the United States to ask the American people to be patriotic about something other than war," Edwards said, adding that America has "so much work to do" to re-establish itself as a moral leader in the world. He challenged Congress to force the president to end the war in Iraq. AP via Boston Globe: Candidates compete at Iowa dinner

<strong>IS IT TIME FOR CANDIDATES TO GO ON THE ATTACK?: </strong>Play it safe, or swing for the fences? That's what candidates in this week's presidential debates must decide. The candidates will face off during the first hour with two veteran local political reporters, Tom Fahey of the Union Leader and Scott Spradling of WMUR. Channel 9 anchor Jennifer Vaughn will work with Blitzer in the last 60 minutes as the candidates answer questions from a pre-selected group of voters. So how should a would-be President deal with this chance to shine in a national spotlight? Longtime Republican activist Donna Sytek knows her primary history and remembers how one master politician took control of a debate. "All of the candidates have to be hoping for an 'I-paid-for-this-microphone' moment," she said, citing Ronald Reagan's powerful words before the most famous New Hampshire debate ever.

<strong>SMALL TOWN PLAYS HOST TO BIG DEABATES:</strong> Enthused that the first New Hampshire debates of the 2008 presidential campaign were set to take place in their town, Goffstown residents are especially eager to learn more about the candidates' positions on health care, education, taxes, and other domestic issues.  "I personally think it's cool it's at Saint A's and that we can attract national-level people," said Meredith Suitor Most people interviewed yesterday said they would watch the debates live or catch up later on the highlights.

<strong>NEW HAMPSHIRE SKETCH: A DEMOCRATIC POWERBROKER:</strong> State Sen. Lou D’Allesandro lives on a quiet cul de sac in a traditional home in this New Hampshire town, but every four years it becomes the Mecca for candidates seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. He opens his house to these White House hopefuls, who use the visit to try and persuade D’Allesandro and other Granite State Democrats to support their presidential bids. Some hopefuls make early evening visits, while others have stopped by for breakfast. A handfulhave even slept over. D’Allesandro’s refrigerator has become a record of these events as photographs of politicians are intermingled with pictures of his family. In short, D’Allesandro is a political powerbroker.

<strong>"INEVITABLE NOMINEES" GEAR UP FOR DEBATES: </strong>Tonight's debate among Democrats is the first of a double-header this week in New Hampshire - home of the nation's first primary for the 2008 presidential election. Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rudy Giuliani - who debates with the Republicans Tuesday - go into the clashes with strong leads and risk losing them if they stumble badly or give their rivals an opportunity to outshine them. Both have been positioning themselves as the inevitable nominees for their parties.  New York Post: Candidates out for debate blood

<strong>DESPITE CHALLENGES, NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY THRIVES:</strong> Last year, the New Hampshire primary appeared to be on its deathbed -- again. First, Democrats allowed Nevada to hold caucuses in the eight days between the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, squeezing another contest ahead of the traditional first-in-the-nation primary. Then, state after state, jealous of New Hampshire's privileged position in the presidential selection process, joined a rush to schedule their primary contests in early February, or even late January. With the likes of New York, California, Illinois, and Florida threatening to vote just days after New Hampshire, how could a tiny state in northern New England still matter? Fast-forward to this week: All the leading candidates are participating in nationally televised Democratic and Republican debates in Manchester today and Tuesday. John Edwards is opening an office in Concord tomorrow . Five Republican candidates, including Mitt Ro!
 mney, plan to attend the state GOP's annual dinner on Wednesday; yesterday, every major Democratic candidate or a high-level surrogate spoke at the state convention. Boston Globe: Despite challenges, New Hampshire Primary thrives:
http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/06/03/-despite_challenges_nh_primary_thrives?mode=PF

<strong>DODD NEEDS A BIG NIGHT:</strong> It's too early in the presidential sweepstakes to use terms such as "critical" or "make-or-break" in describing a single event during these preliminary rounds.  But today is certainly an important day for Democratic candidates, and in particular, Connecticut Sen. Christopher J. Dodd. Tonight, the eight Democratic contenders will gather at St. Anselm's College in Manchester, N.H., for a debate. It will be broadcast locally throughout New Hampshire on WMUR-TV, and nationally on CNN. It's the not the first debate for the field, nor is it expected it will result in any crystal-clear indication of who will ultimately win the nomination. In fact, it's more likely very little will change. Sens. Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and former Sen. John Edwards will still occupy the top tier -- and the others will be still be looking to break out of the second tier. And that's because few candidates are willing to take significant chances in debates !
 at this stage of the game. You can't win the election today, but you could lose it if you're not careful. Norwich Bulletin (CT): Early N.H. debate an important one for Dodd's bid

<strong>RIVAL CAMPAIGNS WANT TOUGH QUESTIONS ANSWERED:</strong> When the Democrats seeking their party’s presidential nomination assemble in Manchester Sunday, they’ll face debate questions assembled by journalists who are trying to be tough but fair, and to be provocative without baiting. The Politico, by contrast, has solicited debate questions from people with no such reservations: competing Democratic campaign aides and advisers to the six leading campaigns.  This is primary season, after all, and partisan firing squads are circular. These rivals submitted questions on the condition that they be identified only as coming from aides or advisers to a Democratic campaign. The questions point sharply to candidates’ perceived weaknesses and map the terrain on which the primary campaign will be fought. The Politico: The Politico roast

<strong>THOMPSON NOT YET DECIDED TO JOIN GOP FIELD:</strong> In one breath, Fred Thompson insists he has not yet decided whether to run for president. In the next, he sounds like a man on the cusp of a full-fledged White House bid. "I've never desired to hold the office, particularly. In fact, not at all," the Republican told The Associated Press. "But, at this stage of things, I sometimes think that I do desire the opportunity to do some things that only a president can do." After flirting with a candidacy for months, the former Tennessee senator and actor known to millions as the tough prosecutor on NBC's "Law & Order" took the first formal step toward the race for the GOP nomination Friday in establishing a preliminary campaign committee. Yet, Thompson claimed in an interview Saturday night, just before giving a speech to Virginia Republicans, that he still wasn't ready to commit to a campaign. AP News via Yahoo.com: Thompson: still undecided on run

<strong>THOMPSON SAYS GOP ON THE 'COMEBACK TRAIL':</strong> Actor and former senator Fred D. Thompson of Tennessee rallied a crowd of several hundred Republicans here last night, offering a bluntly conservative appeal in his first major appearance since taking a formal step last week to run for president. "Folks, we're a bit down politically right now, but I think we're on the comeback trail, and it's going to start right here," he declared in the deep Southern rumble made famous by his roles in film and on television's "Law and Order." The speech at a state Republican Party fundraiser came the day after Thompson filed papers to create a fundraising committee, delivering a jolt to a GOP race in which no one has seized a decisive edge. Many Republicans have lamented that none of the top three candidates can carry a mainstream conservative banner, citing former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's moderate stance on abortion and other social issues, Arizona Sen. John McCain's !
 positions on campaign finance reform and immigration, and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney's recent rightward conversion on issues such as gun control. Washington Post: Thompson generates buzz in Richmond
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/02/AR2007060201163.html?nav=hcmodule

<strong>CLINTON GETS BACK TO HER ROOTS: </strong>For years, when Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton talked about her family, it was usually her famous husband or their well-known daughter. But Clinton has recently been discussing a more elusive figure in her life: her mother. "She didn't have a very easy time of it as a young child," Clinton (D-N.Y.) said during an address to Democratic Party activists in California, describing the journey Dorothy Howell Rodham made in search of a home after her teenage parents divorced in 1920 and sent her away. Drawing attention to her low-profile mother -- who is in her late 80s and lives with the Clintons on Whitehaven Street in Washington -- is one of several ways Clinton is seeking to give voters a new perspective on her biography. Armed with extensive polling data and an image road map tested in Upstate New York, the Clinton campaign has embarked on an ambitious effort to present the candidate the way they want her to be seen: as a pragmatic!
  Midwesterner with a compelling life story of her own, rather than just the famous, and sometimes polarizing, senator and former first lady most of the country already knows she is. Washington Post: Clinton makeover accents her Midwestern roots.

place in their town, Goffstown residents are especially eager
to learn more about the candidates' positions on health care,
education, taxes, and other domestic issues.  "I personally
think it's cool it's at Saint A's and that we can attract
national-level people," said Meredith Suitor Most people
interviewed yesterday said they would watch the debates live or
catch up later on the highlights. New Hampshire Union Leader:
In town hosting debate, voters focus on pocketbook issues

<br><strong>NEW HAMPSHIRE SKETCH: A DEMOCRATIC
POWERBROKER:</strong> State Sen. Lou D’Allesandro lives on a
quiet cul de sac in a traditional home in this New Hampshire
town, but every four years it becomes the Mecca for candidates
seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. He opens his
house to these White House hopefuls, who use the visit to try
and persuade D’Allesandro and other Granite State Democrats to
support their presidential bids. Some hopefuls make early
evening visits, while others have stopped by for breakfast. A
handfulhave even slept over. D’Allesandro’s refrigerator has
become a record of these events as photographs of politicians
are intermingled with pictures of his family. In short,
D’Allesandro is a political powerbroker. CNN Political Ticker:

<br><strong>"INEVITABLE NOMINEES" GEAR UP FOR DEBATES:
</strong>Tonight's debate among Democrats is the first of a
double-header this week in New Hampshire - home of the nation's
first primary for the 2008 presidential election. Hillary
Rodham Clinton and Rudy Giuliani - who debates with the
Republicans Tuesday - go into the clashes with strong leads and
risk losing them if they stumble badly or give their rivals an
opportunity to outshine them. Both have been positioning
themselves as the inevitable nominees for their parties.  New

CHALLENGES, NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY THRIVES:</strong> Last year,
the New Hampshire primary appeared to be on its deathbed --
again. First, Democrats allowed Nevada to hold caucuses in the
eight days between the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire
primary, squeezing another contest ahead of the traditional
first-in-the-nation primary. Then, state after state, jealous
of New Hampshire's privileged position in the presidential
selection process, joined a rush to schedule their primary
contests in early February, or even late January. With the
likes of New York, California, Illinois, and Florida
threatening to vote just days after New Hampshire, how could a
tiny state in northern New England still matter? Fast-forward
to this week: All the leading candidates are participating in
nationally televised Democratic and Republican debates in
Manchester today and Tuesday. John Edwards is opening an office
in Concord tomorrow . Five Republican candidates, including
Mitt Romney, plan to attend the state GOP's annual dinner on
Wednesday; yesterday, every major Democratic candidate or a
high-level surrogate spoke at the state convention. Boston

<br><strong>DODD NEEDS A BIG NIGHT:</strong> It's too early in
the presidential sweepstakes to use terms such as "critical" or
"make-or-break" in describing a single event during these
preliminary rounds.  But today is certainly an important day
for Democratic candidates, and in particular, Connecticut Sen.
Christopher J. Dodd. Tonight, the eight Democratic contenders
will gather at St. Anselm's College in Manchester, N.H., for a
debate. It will be broadcast locally throughout New Hampshire
on WMUR-TV, and nationally on CNN. It's the not the first
debate for the field, nor is it expected it will result in any
crystal-clear indication of who will ultimately win the
nomination. In fact, it's more likely very little will change.
Sens. Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and former Sen. John
Edwards will still occupy the top tier -- and the others will
be still be looking to break out of the second tier. And that's
because few candidates are willing to take significant chances
in debates at this stage of the game. You can't win the
election today, but you could lose it if you're not careful.

Dodd's bid

<br><strong>RIVAL CAMPAIGNS WANT TOUGH QUESTIONS
ANSWERED:</strong> When the Democrats seeking their party’s
presidential nomination assemble in Manchester Sunday, they’ll
face debate questions assembled by journalists who are trying
to be tough but fair, and to be provocative without baiting.
The Politico, by contrast, has solicited debate questions from
people with no such reservations: competing Democratic campaign
aides and advisers to the six leading campaigns.  This is
primary season, after all, and partisan firing squads are
circular. These rivals submitted questions on the condition
that they be identified only as coming from aides or advisers
to a Democratic campaign. The questions point sharply to
candidates’ perceived weaknesses and map the terrain on which
the primary campaign will be fought. The Politico: The Politico

rl><br><br><strong>THOMPSON NOT YET DECIDED TO JOIN GOP
FIELD:</strong> In one breath, Fred Thompson insists he has not
yet decided whether to run for president. In the next, he
sounds like a man on the cusp of a full-fledged White House
bid. "I've never desired to hold the office, particularly. In
fact, not at all," the Republican told The Associated Press.
"But, at this stage of things, I sometimes think that I do
desire the opportunity to do some things that only a president
can do." After flirting with a candidacy for months, the former
Tennessee senator and actor known to millions as the tough
prosecutor on NBC's "Law & Order" took the first formal step
toward the race for the GOP nomination Friday in establishing a
preliminary campaign committee. Yet, Thompson claimed in an
interview Saturday night, just before giving a speech to
Virginia Republicans, that he still wasn't ready to commit to a
campaign. AP News via Yahoo.com: Thompson: still undecided on
run

<br><strong>THOMPSON SAYS GOP ON THE 'COMEBACK TRAIL':</strong>
Actor and former senator Fred D. Thompson of Tennessee rallied
a crowd of several hundred Republicans here last night,
offering a bluntly conservative appeal in his first major
appearance since taking a formal step last week to run for
president. "Folks, we're a bit down politically right now, but
I think we're on the comeback trail, and it's going to start
right here," he declared in the deep Southern rumble made
famous by his roles in film and on television's "Law and
Order." The speech at a state Republican Party fundraiser came
the day after Thompson filed papers to create a fundraising
committee, delivering a jolt to a GOP race in which no one has
seized a decisive edge. Many Republicans have lamented that
none of the top three candidates can carry a mainstream
conservative banner, citing former New York mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani's moderate stance on abortion and other social issues,
Arizona Sen. John McCain's positions on campaign finance reform
and immigration, and former Massachusetts governor Mitt
Romney's recent rightward conversion on issues such as gun
control. Washington Post: Thompson generates buzz in Richmond

<br><strong>CLINTON GETS BACK TO HER ROOTS: </strong>For years,
when Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton talked about her family, it
was usually her famous husband or their well-known daughter.
But Clinton has recently been discussing a more elusive figure
in her life: her mother. "She didn't have a very easy time of
it as a young child," Clinton (D-N.Y.) said during an address
to Democratic Party activists in California, describing the
journey Dorothy Howell Rodham made in search of a home after
her teenage parents divorced in 1920 and sent her away. Drawing
attention to her low-profile mother -- who is in her late 80s
and lives with the Clintons on Whitehaven Street in Washington
-- is one of several ways Clinton is seeking to give voters a
new perspective on her biography. Armed with extensive polling
data and an image road map tested in Upstate New York, the
Clinton campaign has embarked on an ambitious effort to present
the candidate the way they want her to be seen: as a pragmatic
Midwesterner with a compelling life story of her own, rather
than just the famous, and sometimes polarizing, senator and
former first lady most of the country already knows she is.
Washington Post: Clinton makeover accents her Midwestern roots.
