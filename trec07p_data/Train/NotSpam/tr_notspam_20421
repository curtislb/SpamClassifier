xseedit writes "The RIAA has moved their main Web site [0]www.riaa.com
from IIS on Win2003 to Apache 2.2.3 on Red Hat. It appears that the move
did not go smoothly as it resulted in an 8-hour downtime starting
yesterday around noon, according to Netcraft. And the RIAA is still
showing a 'temporarily under construction' page. They also moved their
DNS from the small company that had been hosting them for the past 4
years, Tomorrow's Solutions Today (TST Inc.), to Mindshift Technologies.
One can only guess what happened here, but the move seems to have been
sudden and unplanned. They still haven't moved the riaa.org, riaa.net,
and musicunited.org domains — those are still pointing to the TST
nameservers that no longer accept queries for those domains. TST Inc.
deserves credit, however. They seem to have managed to host the RIAA
quite successfully for the past 4 years. Will Mindshift do a better job
hosting one of the most reviled, and therefore most attacked, Web sites
in the world? I wonder if anybody at the RIAA or TST would care to
comment on the reasons behind this sudden move. Could it be that the RIAA
is being sued by its hosting provider? Or perhaps the sue-happy
organizaiton is suing its provider?"

discovered a new heavy particle called the Cascade B. This is the first
particle ever seen that is made up of quarks representing all three quark
families. A team of 610 physicists from 88 institutions reported the
discovery in a paper submitted to Physical Review Letters last week. This
must be the discovery that triggered [1]rumors that the Higgs had been
found.

[0]The Xoxo Reader writes "Reuters reports that two women at Yale Law
School have [1]filed suit for defamation and infliction of emotional
distress against an administrator and 28 anonymous posters on AutoAdmit
(a.k.a. Xoxohth), a popular law student discussion site. Experts are
watching to see if the suit will unmask the posters, who are
[2]identified in the complaint only by their pseudonyms. Since
AutoAdmit's administrators have previously said that [3]they do not
retain IP logs of posters, identifying the defendants may test the limits
of the legal system and anonymity on the Internet. So far, one method
tried was to [4]post the summons on the message board itself and ask the
defendants to step forward. The [5]controversy leading to this lawsuit
was previously discussed on Slashdot."

thoughts on [0]why fanboys act the way they do. 'For fanboys (and I use
the term with utmost respect, at least for this article), their appetite
to support their favorite company to beat the big, bad corporate
heavyweights gets delusional at times. And why not? After all, we all
like to cheer the underdog... reasonably. In addition to cheering for the
little guy, fanboys also think it's their responsibility to spread the
word about their favorite company. Combine their need to do marketing on
behalf of their adopted companies and their products with the passion to
make others see things their way, and you have a powerful group of
people.'"

The label on the back laid out the terms of use, something similar to an

to note that similar tactics have been in use by record companies for
over a century, restricting your right to use what you purchased. The
label clearly states that unless the record was sold for at least one
dollar, there is [1]no license to use it."

[0]puts a human face to the 'gold farming' profession. Virtual world
economist Julian Dibbell travels to Nanjing, China, for a look at the
working conditions and first-hand experience of farming gold from virtual
monsters as a way to make a living. From the article: 'At the end of each
shift, Li reports the night's haul to his supervisor, and at the end of
the week, he, like his nine co-workers, will be paid in full. For every
100 gold coins he gathers, Li makes 10 yuan, or about $1.25, earning an
effective wage of 30 cents an hour, more or less. The boss, in turn,
receives $3 or more when he sells those same coins to an online retailer,
who will sell them to the final customer (an American or European player)
for as much as $20. The small commercial space Li and his colleagues work
in -- two rooms, one for the workers and another for the supervisor --
along with a rudimentary workers' dorm, a half-hour's bus ride away, are
the entire physical plant of this modest $80,000-a-year business.'"

Berube's new book, Practical Ruby Gems, from Apress. Do Ruby programmers
really need a book devoted entirely to add-on libraries? Most Ruby
programmers already know about the RubyGems package management system,
and most already have their set of favorite gems. About a third of the
way through the book I grudgingly admitted that Rubyists might be able to
use this book. After all, even long-time Ruby programmers are unlikely to
know about all the gems covered in this book. So then I had a new
question. Would I find something in this book that made me say 'I didn't
know you can do that with Ruby!'" Read on for the rest of Tim's review.

[0]Lisandro writes to tell us Geeks of Doom is reporting that author Neil
Gaiman recently announced DreamWorks has [1]optioned the film rights for
his upcoming novel, 'Interworld'. "Gaiman said that in 1996 he began
working with Michael Reaves on the idea for a story 'about a boy who
finds himself in the middle of a war between two equally powerful forces,
who joins a super-team consisting of versions of himself from different
alternate realities to try and maintain the cosmic balance.' Soon after,
the idea was pitched to DreamWorks and other studios, but was turned
down."

today 4th amendment expectation of privacy rights were [1]extended to

upholds a lower court ruling that placed a temporary injunction on e-mail

Enzyte. Warshak hawks Enzyte using "Smiling Bob" ads that have gained
some notoriety.'"

| Pressure Is On IBM To Forgive Millions In IT Debt                  |

[0]coondoggie writes to tell us that several California state legislators
are pressuring IBM to release the Costa school district from some [1]$5
million of long-standing debt as a charitable donation. "The back story
on this tale is that the school district owes IBM for computers ordered
in the late 1980s and early 1990s. For one reason or another the
computers were never used and no one now seems to be able to locate
either the paperwork or the hardware. The school district experienced
hard financial times and ultimately never paid Big Blue for the
computers. In 1993 the district and IBM negotiated a long-term settlement
that said the school district would pay the first of four $1.25 million
installments beginning in 2008. Payments were deferred until then because
2008 was the year the district was scheduled to finish making state loan
repayments under its previous loan plan, according to the Contra Costa
story."

[0]prostoalex writes "As part of the deal with the FCC to approve the
AT&T/BellSouth merger, AT&T [1]started selling, but not advertising, a
$10-per-month DSL service in 22 states, AP has learned. 'The service
provides download speeds of up to 768 kilobits per second and upload
speeds of up to 128 kbps, matching the speeds of the cheapest advertised
AT&T plan, which costs $19.95 per month in the nine-state former
BellSouth area and $14.99 in the 13 states covered by AT&T before the
acquisition.'"
