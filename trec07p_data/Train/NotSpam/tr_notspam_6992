   It influenced the policy of Digg, a pretty modern and obviously 
Web2.0 aware company, not the policy of the government.  Who a political 
action is aimed at matters.

   Because they believe (IMHO correctly) that they are more likely to 
get hit by lightning than get caught for this infringement.  They are 
seen as doing it because they can get away with it, not because they 
have something substantive to say about the underlying laws.


   I hear this argument that infringement is a form of civil 
disobedience often, and I simply don't buy it.  Politicians are also not 
buying it, and believe that all that is needed to "fix" this problem is 
pass more laws -- especially those targeted at intermediaries (which are 
fewer, and thus easier to control).

   "if seen by" -- and that is my point, it's not being seen by our 
politicians or other policy makers.


   Most politicians are unaware of anything we talk about and work with 
on a daily basis.  They think there is either only one or two sources of 
computer operating systems, and have no idea of the entertainment value 
of user generated content.


   Of the MPs I've met so far I believe that Bev Oda and Hedy Fry 
represent the majority of those that have an opinion at all on issues of 
copyright, and both have no problem shutting down all alternatives to 
the "professional"/incumbent methods of production, distribution and 
funding of content.  (IE: Goodbye personal ownership/control of ICT, 
user generated content, peer production, etc)

   Civil disobedience that isn't clearly documented and understandable 
to the policy makers who make the rules can easily backfire.  I believe 
all the infringement that is currently going on is further convincing 
Canadian policy makers to push towards more draconian laws.

   The petitions are written in a language that policy makers can 
understand (in fact, that is one of their flaws-- the general public has 
a harder time understanding them).  Copyright infringement isn't being 
seen by policy makers as a form of civil disobedience, just "theft". 
And this will never change until we stop speaking to ourselves and start 
speaking with them.
