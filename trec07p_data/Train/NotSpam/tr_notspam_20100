One more suggestion. If gentoo or ubuntoo or any distro 
doesn't include speakup, how about a script that grabs 
a kernel from kernel.org, extracts, patches, compiles, 
and installs it? I once made a script that built an entire
linux system from scratch, I mean building the toolchain
and all, if that's possible surely this is too. I suppose the
tricky part is kernel config, but even then it should be 
possible to make a generic kernel that would boot with
speech on just about anything, with some work.

Or, you could use slackware, hehe. 
Screw gentoo. Just kidding.
