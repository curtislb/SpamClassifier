i think splshy will be ready for lenny and is  great improveent to have
it. It is something that is really missed by the users.

we definetly need better desktop graphics environment. Also continue
the d-i, gnome, kde, xfce, splash graphics integration.
(thanks also to andre for the more blue theme)

agreed. Live cd's (from debian-live) seem to be easy to create, so we
could have a set of the to show what we want. For instance, this was
talked in -devel about show development tools  for linux/debian.

Here i have a bigger word to say. 
Debian targeted users are mainly companies, or even small business, so,
i think we could provide a set of tasks that coul easilly set up an
enterprise environment with desktops and a main server.

In many comanies that use linux, set up a small shared user database and
set up shared folders and info is quite hard.

We at debian-desktop should provide a task that is oriented for
enterprise desktop. I don't really say that it should be too diferent
from the main desktop task, but have libpam-ldap and other productivity
tools.

Also a ldap server task should be added to perform the server side.

I really think debian has a few cards to show in enterprises, so let's
get it better.
