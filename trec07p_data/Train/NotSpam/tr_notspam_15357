						<div class=3D"GreyHeading">CLARE BALDING ON THE EPSOM DERBY</div>
						<div>Frankie Dettori's much-documented failure to win the Derby at Ep=
som is one of those real sporting conundrums.
<br>

<br>
It's like Tim Henman not winning a Grand Slam event and Colin Montgomerie n=
ot winning a Major, they are too good not to, yet it shows just how incredi=
bly tough it is to do.
<br>

<br>
As far as winning the Derby's concerned, you have to have the right horse a=
nd, in Authorized this year, Dettori has really struck it lucky.
<br>

<br>
I would love to see the highly-fancied horse win as racing in general needs=
 good publicity and lots of it.=20
<br>

<br>
Frankie winning the Derby would be as good as it gets.
<br>

<br>
The 36-year-old is very, very nervous, more nervous than he has ever been.
<br>

<br>
He is really geed up, but I think when he gets on the horse he will just go=
 into neutral and will do it all without thinking.
<br>

<br>
Provided he doesn't get stuck behind a wall of horses I think Authorized ha=
s everything to recommend him.=20
<br>

<br>
We know the horse is a stayer, we know he likes soft ground so Dettori will=
 just want to get a good position coming down the hill, sit and wait and th=
en press the button two furlongs out.
<br>

<br>
The Peter Chapple-Hyam trained horse is so good he could be as an impressiv=
e a winner as Motivator was in 2005 - and Motivator was clearly the best we=
 have seen since Shergar way back in 1981.
<br>

<br>
Aside from Authorized I like the look of Regime, who won the Classic Trial =
at Sandown.
<br>

<br>
There is also the big question over how many runners trainer Aidan O'Brien =
will have.
<br>

<br>
I think his best chance will come from Admiralofthefleet who is a fine hors=
e and I liked the way he won at Chester.
<br>

<br>
But it is Authorized's to lose and the bookies face losing an absolute fort=
une - doesn't your heart just bleed for them.
<br>

<br>
<B>Clare Balding will present BBC One's coverage of Epsom from 1255 BST on =
Saturday. Big race 1620.</b>
