If we go the route of converting Perl scripts into windows executables, then there is the Perl Power Tools (ppt) project for perl that aims to create a cross platform set of common Unix tools (see  http://sourceforge.net/projects/ppt/, or the current toolset can be downloaded from CPAN).  The find utility has been included for a while and I think we could get the author of that one to help.  
 
If all the Unix tools needed by R are included in ppt, then it may be possible to use those in Rtools for an overall smaller footprint.  The find perl script could be compiled to an .exe and given a different name so that it would not conflict with the windows find command.
 
There would need to be some switch or something to indicate using these tools rather than the standards for those that don't use the Rtools (but insteal installed perl and the other tools).

I don't, because R building requires simulation of a subset of a Unix
environment, so in case of a Unix/Windows conflict, Unix should win.
For example none of the Makefiles use backslashes as path separators,
they all use Unix-style forward slashes.
