That's no longer the case; both logos are now available under the MIT
license, however a public announcement hasn't been made pending some
details.

Yes, clearly no progress was made, and certainly all the progress that wasn't
made was in spite of anything I might have done.

It's likewise nice to see we're back to "-legal" not being a mailing
list, but an unconstituted advisory body that manages to be a responsible
body, somehow.

Yeesh.
