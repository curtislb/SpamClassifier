Applied in revisions: 18484--18488; thanks!

I changed the output generated when tests fail slightly and TODO'ed the 
identical header guard test until we have a decent way to check for 
copied header files.  Some C languages files are exempted from the 
coding standards tests and you might want to do a similar thing here 
with the C headers.  Have a look at is_c_exemption() in lib/Parrot/
Distribution.pm (and the file in general).

One nit: the changes to the test should really have been a separate 
patch.  Thanks for your hard work!

Paul
