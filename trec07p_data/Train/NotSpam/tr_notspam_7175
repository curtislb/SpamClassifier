[0]slashdotLIKES writes "CoolTechZone.com columnist Gundeep Hora has a
new column up that [1]discusses why Apple should acquire AMD and how both
companies would be a good fit for each other. From the article, "After
private equity groups, let's look at a more strategic acquisition. For
that, Apple is the best bet. Yes, I know it sounds way too radical to be
taken seriously. However, Apple could drop Intel altogether and adopt AMD
for its Macintosh PCs. Sure, the transition is going to take sometime,
and it would probably make Apple announce a brand new line of PCs.
However, it will be well worth it. We know Steve Jobs is ruthless when it
comes to making interesting deals with powerful companies. This makes AMD
a perfect match. Obviously Intel isn't going to be too delighted, but
other companies don't bother Jobs. We all know he's the type of executive
who crafts deals on his own terms. If Intel wants to be associated with
Apple, then they won't really have much of a choice."

Technologies had published an article bemoaning and blasting Microsoft's

framework when they're doing everything in their power to stop it from
being just that. Of interest is NeoSmart's analysis of how Microsoft has
no problem making certain portions of .NET available to Mac users — just
so long as its distributed under an "open source" license that forbids
any and all use of the code except for educational purposes — yet are
terrified of the very thought of .NET being available to *nix users, even
if that's to the benefit of .NET developers everywhere. Even more
interesting is one of the comments on that article linking to legal
documents in which Microsoft employees discuss [2]the (im)possibility of
creating a cross-platform code and UI framework, years before the .NET

denebian devil writes "Wired.com has obtained a copy of updated [0]US
Army rules (pdf) that force soldiers to [1]stop posting to blogs or
sending personal e-mail messages without first clearing the content with
a superior officer. Previous editions of the rules asked Army personnel
to "consult with their immediate supervisor" before posting a document
"that might contain sensitive and/or critical information in a public
forum." The new version, in contrast, requires "an OPSEC review prior to
publishing" anything — from "web log (blog) postings" to comments on
internet message boards, from resumes to letters home. Under the
strictest reading of the rule, a soldier must check with his or her
superior officer before every blog entry posted and every email sent,
though the method of enforcing these regulations is subject to choices
made by the unit commanders. According to Wired, active-duty troops
aren't the only ones affected by the new guidelines. Civilians working
for the military, Army contractors — even soldiers' families — are all
subject to the directive as well, though many of the people affected by
these new regulations can't even access them because they are being kept
on the military's restricted Army Knowledge Online intranet. Wired also
[2]interviewed Major Ray Ceralde, author of the new regulations, about
why this change has been made."

article on how [1]Obama's MySpace page is currently the subject of an
underground battle for control by the campaign itself and the volunteer
who created it in 2004. Joseph Anthony worked with the campaign initially
and grew the site to include over 160,000 unsolicited friends that the
campaign could use to reach out to. It currently is the [2]main Obama
page in the [3]Impact Channel on MySpace. However, as Obama's campaign
became more centralized and formal, the decision was made to attempt to
acquire control of the site from Anthony. They asked him for a price,
which he offered up as $49,000 plus part of the $10,000 fee paid to
MySpace for the Impact Channel. Obama balked at the price, and decided to
start afresh rather than pay the money. The fight broke out into the open
when Anthony [4]posted a response on his blog to rumors that the campaign
was spreading regarding him wanting to cash out. [5]MyDD has more."

anti-human 1 writes to tell us Wired is reporting that DARPA is
developing a [0]new optics system to help soldiers identify threats
earlier. "The most far-reaching component of the binocs has nothing to do
with the optics: it's Darpa's aspirations to integrate EEG electrodes
that monitor the wearer's neural signals, cueing soldiers to recognize
targets faster than the unaided brain could on its own. The idea is that
EEG can spot 'neural signatures' for target detection before the
conscious mind becomes aware of a potential threat or target. [...] In
other words, like Spiderman's 'spider sense', a soldier could be alerted
to danger that his or her brain had sensed, but not yet had time to
process."

An anonymous reader writes "A Domain Tools blog post is reporting on a
Russian newspaper article regarding a provision of Russian law that would
[0]prohibit public access or posting of Whois data for the .RU TLD
without written permission. The Personal Data law, which the article
states went into effect on January 30, 2007, will require compliance by
RosNIIROSa (www.ripn.net) by 2010."

According to the New York Times, Vonage is preparing to take it's case
[0]back down to the lower courts for a retrial of the lawsuit against
them from Verizon. Their hope is that with newer approaches set forth by
the supreme court that the lower courts will be able to decide whether
Verizon's patent(s) are ordinary/obvious or deserve patent protection. I
wonder if this time it will be more obvious to the courts that Verizon's
patents aren't so original?

DOS and Windows. Inconsistencies abound and everything is a special case.
The fallback on a Microsoft box has been running a Unix shell under
Cygwin or installing Microsoft's own Services for Unix (or its
predecessor, Softway's Interix), or by scripting in Perl, but those only
get you so far. Having co-written nine years worth of trade rag columns
using mostly Perl as the implementation language for the samples, and
thinking of every problem that comes across my desk as an excuse to write
a little bit of scripting code, I've got some well-formed views about
scripting languages and what works and what doesn't. That means I've been
eagerly watching the development of PowerShell since it was called Monad.
It's got the advantage of being a unified command-line interface and
scripting language for Windows, even if it does have a dorky name." Read

tanman writes "A student at the Houston-area Clements High School was
arrested, sent to an "Alternative Education Center" and banned from
graduation after school officials found he [0]created a video game map of
his school. School district police arrested the teen and searched his
home where they confiscated a hammer as a 'potential weapon'. ' "They
decided he was a terroristic threat," said one source close to the
district's investigation.' With an upcoming May 12 school board election,
this issue has quickly become political, with school board members
involved in the appeal accusing each other of pandering to the Chinese
community in an attempt to gain votes."

Dojo 0.3.1, Prototype and Scriptaculous 1.4, Direct Web Reporting 1.0,
Yahoo! User Interface Library 0.11.1 and Google Web Toolkit 1.0. Each
framework was tested in two basic scenarios — writing a 'hub' (titled
collapsible link list frequently seen on sidebars of many Web sites) and
a 'tab panel' (horizontal tabbed navigation bar). During the process, Dr.
Dobb's Journal reviewers noted that 'Dojo provides more features and HTML

Science Daily is reporting that scientists have developed a new method
for cost-effectively producing [0]four-armed quantum dots that have
previously been shown to be particularly effective at converting sunlight
into electrical energy. The discovery could clear the way for better,
cheaper solar energy panels.

I was surfing through my usual tech sites for the latest news when I came
across an article on Wired News. It turns out [0]Steve Case is not alone
in the quest to [1]fix the health care system. I guess I don't get what
the big attraction for these guys are.... I know the US's health care
system is messed up, but I'm not sure technology can fix all of the
aches, pains and dysfunction in our current system. I don't get why they
don't just join a major company's board or start a hip/trendy
start-up....
