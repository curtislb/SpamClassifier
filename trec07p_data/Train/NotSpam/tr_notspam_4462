Hi Spie et al...

Sorry for the delayed response. I just saw this.

The sound quality was good in so far as I could tell just sitting
around the salon having my toes painted hot pink....

It was a satellite station of "retro-alternative" sort of stuff. It
was called Second Wave or something... It's murky.

I'm sure with the maturing of folks whose youth was during this
musical time period into their prime earning years... and with the
demographic so heavily laden with childless computer geeks with money
to burn..... much has been done to scrape together and remaster every
last drop of this genre/period. Or perhaps there's a less media
industry jaded explanation for it.... I'm sure the enduring brilliance
of all that is Kate has something to do with it as well.

XO!
