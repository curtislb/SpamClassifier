From: Michael Palmedo

Sen. Dorgan has attached his reimportation bill (S.242) to the FDA
authorization bill (S.1082) as an amendment.  This bill will be voted on

today, and industry has some press pieces out about it.  The President
has said the amendment to the bill makes it dead on arrival.

Dorgan's office says that if the bill goes nowhere as an amendment, they

will still move forward with the bill as stand-alone legislation.
