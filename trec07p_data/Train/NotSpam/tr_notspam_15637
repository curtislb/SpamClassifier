I partially agree with this, but I think it's also important to
consider that the CD as an object, an artistic package, is a cultural
artifact itself and of some value to a lot of us still.

I am not sure I follow this last bit, but I often see the conflation
theft, piracy, and filesharing, even when well-intentioned. Right now
I do not think there is much of a threat of music piracy as a revenue
drain, as it stands, piracy unimpeded has had many positive effects
and, to some extent, has inserted fans into the creation process in a
way they haven't previously been, for better or for worse.
