<br>
Newsnight has decided to kill off its Ethical Man. After a year of trying t=
o live with due consideration to his impact on the planet, Justin Rowlatt i=
s moving on to other challenges.=20
<br>

<br>
But the serious point behind the project was to try to gauge what differenc=
e an individual can make to the environment.=20
<br>

<br>
Justin will conclude his series of reports and will join in the debate with=
 those who can make an even bigger difference, including the Environment Se=
cretary David Miliband.=20

Today's Joke Fit For an Eleven Year Old comes from Newsnight viewer Zombie:=
=20
<br>

<br>
An English doctor is being shown around a Scottish hospital. At the end of =
his visit, he is shown into a ward with a number of patients who show no ob=
vious signs of injury. He goes to examine the first patient he sees, and th=
e man proclaims:
<br>

<br>
"Fair fa' yer honest, sonsie face,
<br>
Great chieftain o' the puddin' race!"
<br>

<br>
The English doctor, somewhat taken aback, goes to the next patient, and imm=
ediately the patient launches into:
<br>

<br>
"Some hae meat and canna eat,
<br>
And some wad eat that want it."
<br>

<br>
This continues with the next patient:
<br>

<br>
"Wee sleekit cow'rin tim'rous beastie,
<br>
O what a panic's in thy breastie!"
<br>

<br>
"Well," the English doctor mutters to his Scottish colleague, "I see you sa=
ved the psychiatric ward for the last."
<br>

<br>
"Oh no," the Scottish doctor corrected him, "this is the serious Burns unit=
."=20=20
