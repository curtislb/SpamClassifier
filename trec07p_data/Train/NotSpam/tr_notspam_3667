Oh yes.  It's swapping like crazy.  Sorry I didn't mention that 
explicitly.  (I figured it was obvious!)  The machine in question has 
128 MB of physical RAM.  Normally, in order to not be antisocial and bring 
a shared machine to its knees, I set ulimit to restrict both the virtual 
memory and the CPU time before running the parrot build and test scripts.

Specifically, I usually do something like:

    ulimit -S -t 300   # Avoid runaway tests.
    ulimit -S -v 98304 # 96 MB max:  Avoid runaway memory leaks.
    ulimit -S -c 0     # Writing 96 MB core files wastes a lot of time.

That catches most of the "Out of mem" errors and kills most (but not
all) of the hanging tests without excessively degrading performance for
other processes running on the same system.

The main result is that the memory footprint of the pge tests appears to
continuously grow.  This is reasonable because they run with -G, i.e.
garbage collection is turned off.  Oddly, if you turn on garbage
collection, the memory use grows *faster*.  Either way, I can't run the
tests.
