G8 Declaration on Innovation and Intellectual Property Will Directly Harm
              Access to Medicines Across the Developing World

Heiligendamm, 7 June 2007 – The G8 leaders’ agreement to demand higher
levels of intellectual property protection in emerging economies is set to
have a major negative impact on access to affordable medicines in all
developing countries and fails to promote health innovation where it is
most needed, the international medical humanitarian organization Médecins
Sans Frontières (MSF) said today.

Middle-income countries such as India and Brazil are key producers of
affordable essential medicines that are used locally and across the
developing world.  Generic medicines produced in India, for example, make
up more than 80% of antiretrovirals (ARVs) used by MSF to treat over 80,000
patients in its AIDS projects in over 30 countries. The day before meeting
a number of developing country leaders, the G8 have already decided to
create a new process to further increase patent protection in the
developing world, in particular in emerging economies.

“If the G8 further increases patent protection, it will keep prices of new
drugs across Africa, Asia and Latin America high and will do nothing to
stimulate innovation where it is most needed,” said Dr. Tido von
Schoen-Angerer, Director of MSF’s Campaign for Access to Essential
Medicines. “We need AIDS medicines that are more affordable and we also
desperately need new and better tests and medicines to treat tuberculosis
and tropical diseases.”

A report from the World Health Organization (WHO) released in April 2006
found that intellectual property protection does not stimulate development
of medicines to treat diseases that primarily affect people in developing
countries. Yet G8 leaders solely promote increased intellectual property
protection as the way to foster innovation. Although WHO has set up an
intergovernmental working group to address the problem of innovation and
access for developing countries, the G8 is flatly ignoring this process.

Counterfeit medicines are a danger to people’s health that received
particular attention by the G8. Similar attention should have been paid to
the need for affordable, quality generic medicines upon which poor
countries can rely.

With international trade laws making medicines patenting far more
widespread, newer drugs are becoming unaffordable.  Newer medicines are
critical, e.g. for the treatment of AIDS, where a second-line drug
combination costs at least five times more than first line.

To address high drug prices, countries such as Brazil and Thailand have
recently overcome patent barriers by issuing ‘compulsory licenses’ on
several drugs. Although these measures are fully compliant with the TRIPS
Agreement of the World Trade Organization, these countries are facing
unacceptable pressure and retaliation from some governments and
pharmaceutical companies.

By ignoring fora that have traditionally dealt with intellectual property
and instead only inviting five emerging economies to talks, the G8 is
ignoring the critical input of other developing countries, whose own
ability to obtain affordable and appropriate medicines is affected by such
discussions.

“Stricter levels of intellectual property protection will only worsen the
health crisis in developing countries, where medicines are either
unaffordable or simply not available because there is no market to
incentivise their development,” said Rohit Malpani, Policy Advisor with
Oxfam.

SIGN MSF'S 'DROP THE CASE' PETITION

Millions of people around the world today rely on affordable medicines
produced in India.  Pharmaceutical company Novartis is taking the Indian
government to court to force a change in the country's patent law.  If
Novartis wins, a major source of affordable medicines for millions of
people across the globe could dry up.

MSF is urging Novartis to DROP THE CASE.
