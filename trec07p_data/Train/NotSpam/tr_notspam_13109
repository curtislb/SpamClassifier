Doctors Without Borders-Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF)

For Immediate Release

Health Worker Shortage Limits Access to HIV/AIDS Treatment in Southern
Africa
New MSF - Help Wanted-Report

Johannesburg. South Africa. May 24. 2007 – The dire lack of health care
workers in southern Africa is threatening efforts to expand access to
HIV/AIDS treatment, warned the international medical humanitarian
organization Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) in a
new report issued today. The report covers four southern African
countries—Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and South Africa—where more than one
million people still need life-saving antiretroviral treatment but do not
have access to it. Lack of action will result in unnecessary illness and
death.

'In Thyolo district we are treating 7,000 people with HIV/AIDS. We need to
increase this number to 10,000 by the end of the year, but our program is
hitting a wall because there are simply not enough nurses, doctors, and
medical assistants,' said Veronica Chikafa, a nurse/matron working with
MSF in Malawi.

The full report is available online at:
http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/publications/reports/2007/healthcare_worker_report_05-2007.pdf

Severe shortages of health staff are compromising the quality and
availability of HIV/AIDS care across southern Africa. In Thyolo district
in Malawi, a medical assistant can see up to 200 patients per day, far too
many to ensure quality care.  In Mavalane district in Mozambique, patients
are forced to wait for up to two months to start treatment because of the
lack of doctors and nurses, and many have died during the wait.

In Lesotho there are only 89 doctors in the whole country.  'Providing HIV
care in rural clinics depends on nurses, but they are overwhelmed by the
number of patients,' said Dr. Pheello Lethola, field doctor for MSF in
Lesotho.  'Consultation times are too short, and sick patients suffer
needlessly. When nurses suffer, patients suffer.'

There is wide acknowledgement of the human resource crisis, but little
action on the ground.  MSF is urging governments to develop and implement
emergency plans to retain and recruit health care workers that include
measures to raise pay and improve working conditions. In most countries
this will only happen if donors change their policies and start providing
financial support for recurrent costs such as salaries. Ministries of
finance and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will need to find
solutions to overcome 'caps' on the number of health workers and level of
salaries. Otherwise, governments will not be able to respond adequately to
the unmet need for treatment.

Even in South Africa, which has more health care workers who are better
paid compared to other southern African countries, unequal distribution
and inadequate numbers of staff are causing delays to expanding treatment.
'Clinics are absolutely saturated, waiting lists are growing, and it feels
like we are losing the battle,' said Dr. Eric Goemaere, head of MSF’s
program in Khayelitsha, Western Cape.  'For people making policies in
offices far away from patients, our message is that you will be held
responsible if you are not reactive or flexible enough to find solutions
to the staff shortages.'

To expand access to HIV care in rural settings, MSF teams have relied on
'task-shifting' from doctors to nurses, and from nurses to community
workers.  But these are limited measures that do not remove the need for
additional skilled staff.

'It is incomprehensible that donors provide funds for life-long aids
treatment and the building of new clinics, but refuse support for health
care worker salaries on the grounds that this is unsustainable, said
Sharonann Lynch, treatment literacy coordinator for MSF in Lesotho.
'People living with HIV/AIDS do not only need drugs and clinics; they need
trained, motivated health care workers to diagnose, monitor, and treat
them.'

In the four countries profiled in this report, MSF is presently providing
antiretroviral treatment (ART) for nearly 30,000 people.  Worldwide, MSF
provides ART to over 80,000 patients in more than 30 countries.
