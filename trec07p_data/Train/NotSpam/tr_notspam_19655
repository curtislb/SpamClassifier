CBS NEWS STS-117 STATUS REPORT: 63
Posted: 4:55 PM, 6/15/07

By William Harwood
CBS News Space Analyst

Changes and additions:

   SR-60 (06/15/07): Russians shut down computers again for additional trou=
bleshooting; no obvious 'smoking gun' in U.S. power
   SR-61 (06/15/07): Astronauts gear up for spacewalk
   SR-62 (06/15/07): Spacewalk begins; blanket repair work goes smoothly
   SR-63 (06/15/07): Russians restart computers; faulty secondary power swi=
tch possible culprit; more troubleshooting planned

4:55 PM, 6/15/07, Update: Station computers brought to life after impromptu=
 repair=20

In a possible breakthrough, space station commander Fyodor Yurchikhin and f=
light engineer Oleg Kotov used a jumper cable to bypass a suspect secondary=
 power supply switch today and successfully activated four of six navigatio=
n and command computers that appeared to malfunction earlier this week, NAS=
A officials said.

Details were not immediately clear, but two channels, or "lanes," in the Ru=
ssian central command-and-control computer appeared to operate normally aft=
er the improvised power supply repair, along with two of three lanes making=
 up the station's guidance and navigation computer, known collectively as t=
he terminal computer.

"Fyodor, go ahead and activate the central computer power... one, two, thre=
e," ground control called. A few moments later, after reviewing diagnostic =
data, a controller (speaking through an interpreter) radioed: "Well, good n=
ews, it's good news that it's working."

Each system includes three redundant computers that work in concert to avoi=
d faulty data or incorrect results. The terminal computer system operates t=
he station's Russian rocket thrusters to re-orient the lab complex as requi=
red to keep sunlight on solar arrays and to keep sensitive systems from get=
ting too hot or too cold.

The central computer is used to control the Russian segment's Elektron oxyg=
en generator, its Vozdukh carbon dioxide removal system and a variety of ot=
her critical functions. While both computer systems are triply redundant, t=
he systems can safely operate the station with a single channel, or lane, i=
n each computer.

Earlier this week, around the time the Atlantis astronauts were installing =
a new solar power truss, the terminal computer crashed. An automated reboot=
 procedure was then executed to shut down and restart all three terminal co=
mputer lanes and all three central computer channels. The reboot procedure =
didn't work, however, and engineers have been struggling ever since to rest=
ore the computer system to normal operation.

After the power supply bypass surgery today, Russian flight controllers tol=
d their NASA counterparts lanes one and three were had been successfully re=
powered in the terminal computer, along with lanes two and three in the cen=
tral computer. The systems then were shut down to close access panels and a=
pparently restarted in self-test mode as planned. Controllers said they pla=
n to operate the computers throughout the evening and to collect telemetry =
for additional analysis during passes over Russian ground sites early Satur=
day.

Earlier this afternoon, U.S. flight controllers told spacewalker James Reil=
ly to disconnect a power cable in a newly installed solar array truss to he=
lp engineers determine whether the cable might have played a role inthe com=
puter malfunctions earlier this week. The miscues began right around the ti=
me the cable was connected Monday.

But late today, astronaut Megan McArthur radioed the crew from Houston sayi=
ng that might no longer be necessary.

"They did have good fortune over there on the computers," she said.
