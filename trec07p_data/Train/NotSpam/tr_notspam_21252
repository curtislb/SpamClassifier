Oh, I'm not suggesting that *every* program be distributed as a  
static linked binary, only those that you can't obtain source for.   
That would eliminate a *lot* of problems like this one, and ones I've  
run into with lotus notes as well.
If these commercial companies aren't allowing sources so folks can  
rebuild when they move distros, then they *should* distribute static  
linked executables so you don't have to go  through this kind of  
nonsense.  I'd think it'd be in their best interest to do so, since  
it would mean fewer support calls, fewer complaints, and most of all,  
future compatibility regardless of linux distro the client is using.
But, that's just me.
