SteriCoat racks up another, even bigger innovation prize


SteriCoat, an early stage company developing an antimicrobial coating
for medical devices, this week won a new innovation prize — $250,000
of seed financing from the first annual DFJ East Coast Venture
Challenge at the Columbia Business School.

Two of the founders of Stericoat are Joel Moxley and Christopher
Loose, who both majored in chemical engineering while undergraduates
at Princeton.

Last year SteriCoat captured the $100,000 prize in an innovation
competition sponsored by MIT, where they are now graduate students.
And earlier this year SteriCoat won the the Life Sciences category of
a business plan competition at Rice.

You can listen to Loose and Moxley talk about their vision for
SteriCoat on this podcast (Episode 95) from the Businessmakers Radio
Show. Also of interest: Moxley is one of the researchers who recently
reported in Science they have engineered a yeast that promises to
make ethanol production faster and more efficient. Find out about
more here about a recent paper that Loose co-authored in the journal
Nature on research that may lead to a new generation of customized
microbe-killing medicines.
