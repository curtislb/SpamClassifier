Well, because it's "for" that implies "do stuff". "map" means 
"transform stuff and give me the results". With a "for" I expect that 
the work will be done as a side-effect, with "map" I expect that the 
code block will be side-effect free. That it will get a value and 
produce a value (or values). Sure, it may make sense to produce a 
value and do something more at the same time, but the produced value 
should be the main result.
