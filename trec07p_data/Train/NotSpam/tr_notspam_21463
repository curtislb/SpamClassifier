     Yep!  Just came in this evening.  Hooked that puppy up first thing,
then tried playing with Slackware.  Only came back to Windows to ask wtf 
about where speakup.i went, and on another mailing list on which fs was 
better, EXT3 or reiserfs.  I think I'll stick with the EXT3 file system 
for now, and go over the Slackware docs again.  Will do the install 
tomorrow, when I'm fresh and re-indocumentrinated. <grins>  Thanks for 
all the help folks,

         Michael
