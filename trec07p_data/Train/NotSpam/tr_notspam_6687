The fact that the FAQ and web page haven't been updated in years may lead 
one to the same conclusion.  For example, the question about installing 
Linux eyes-free only barely mentions Speakup, and fails to mention the 
Speakup modified Redhat, or that Slackware has included Speakup since 
version 8.0 which was released in 2001.
