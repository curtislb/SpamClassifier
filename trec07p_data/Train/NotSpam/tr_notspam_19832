If you are installing on amd system then moving to p3 system,
and the kernel is crashing, then you need to find a way to boot
a more generic kernel on the target system. If there is no CD 
the hopefully there is floppy drive. Prepare or find a generic 
kernel for the floppy disk, and when booting, from the boot 
prompt, you'll need to do something like:

generic-kernel-name root=/dev/hda1 noinitrd

Where generic-kernel-name is the name of the kernel on boot
disk and root points to the root filesystem partition on the 
target machine. Basically you want to boot the kernel on the
floppy but boot it using the root filesystem on the target hard
drive. Once the system is booted, compile a new kernel on 
the p3 and update the bootloader accordingly to refer to the
new kernel.
