Hello,

I have noticed that linux-speakup.org is currently unavailable as well 
as the mirror.  I am attempting a LFS build and Speakup is a pretty 
crucial part of my new system :)  Has anyone ever thought of putting 
this project on Source Forge or another one of those open source project 
pages for better reliability?

Thanks,
