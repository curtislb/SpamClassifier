8:30 PM, 5/30/07, Update: Spacewalk ends

Expedition 15 commander Fyodor Yurchikhin and Oleg Kotov closed the outer h=
atch of the Pirs airlock module at 8:30 p.m. today to officially end a succ=
essful five-hour and 25-minute spacewalk. The cosmonauts installed five pro=
tective micrometeoroid debris panels on the Zvezda command module and re-po=
sitioned a GPS antenna cable on the back of the module that will be needed =
to route navigation data to unmanned European cargo vehicles starting late =
this year.

This was the 82nd spacewalk devoted to station assembly and maintenance, pu=
shing the total amount of ISS EVA time to 503 hours and 28 minutes since co=
nstruction began in 1998. Yurchikhin and Kotov plan to stage another spacew=
alk next Wednesday to install 12 more debris panels on the command module.
