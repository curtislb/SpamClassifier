Thank you so much Robert. Please find the information below. 

The scale 1-10 are subjective physical condition ratings scored by inspection engineers at the site. 1-5 are in very bad conditions (bridge close down to seriously deteriorated). The rest from 6-10 are categorized as good condition.However, the proportion of samples in my data are as follows. Bridges with 1-5 scale covers about 2-3% of total population. The majority of the bridges are in 7-8. Certainly, I have enough data for model estimation but the mix of the proportion is good. I attached the detail of condition rating scale at the end of this message.

As a result, my ordered probit model yield cutting points that cannot capture level 1-5 well. Even in my in-sample population, the model cannot capture level 2-5 at all. In other words, with the estimated cutting points for level 1-5, I have zero bridges that belong to level 2-5. Unfortunately, my objective is especially to analyze statistically what kind of design attributes lead to such a bad condition. So I would like my model to be able to capture bad condition bridges as much as it could.


9                  EXCELLENT CONDITION

8                  VERY GOOD CONDITION - no problems noted.

7                  GOOD CONDITION - some minor problems.

6                  SATISFACTORY CONDITION - structural elements show some minor deterioration.

5                  FAIR CONDITION - all primary structural elements are sound but may have minor section loss, cracking, 
                    spalling or scour.

4                  POOR CONDITION - advanced section loss, deterioration, spalling or scour.

3                  SERIOUS CONDITION - loss of section, deterioration of primary structural elements.  Fatigue cracks 
                    in steel or shear cracks in concrete may be present.

2                  CRITICAL CONDITION - advanced deterioration of primary structural elements.  Fatigue cracks in steel 
                    or shear cracks in concrete may be present or scour may have removed substructure support.  Unless 
                    closely monitored it may be necessary to close the bridge until corrective action is taken.

1                  "IMMINANT" FAILURE CONDITION - major deterioration or section loss present in critical sructural 
                    components or obvious vertical or horizontal movement affecting structure stability.  Bridge is 
                    closed to traffic but corrective action may put it back in light service.

0                  FAILED CONDITION - out of service; beyond corrective action.
