Hi, Does some one have such a program?
I am looking for a program which will speak the origional string and then 
allow the typing of the new translated string.
It should then go onto the next string and have some means of quitting 
half-way.
I have edited some .po files using a standard text-editor, but it is 
time-consuming.
TIA, Willem
