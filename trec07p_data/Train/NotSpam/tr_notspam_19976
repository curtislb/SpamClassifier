8:39 AM, 6/17/07, Update: Astronauts prepare for final spacewalk=20

Flight controllers have re-activated most of the major systems in the Russi=
an segment of the international space station, keeping four of six revived =
primary computers on line and two on standby for use as needed.

"Things are looking very good," Flight Director Holly Ridings said early to=
day. "In real generic terms, everything's back on except for our Elektron (=
oxygen generator) and they just wanted to wait and watch the computers for =
another day or two and make sure everything was good before they brought it=
 back up. But that's almost nominal in terms of all the systems."

U.S. and Russian mission managers plan to test the station's attitude contr=
ol system Monday, between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m., to make sure the revived Russ=
ian guidance, navigation and control system computers can maintain the prop=
er orientation using rocket thrusters. If that test goes well, the recovery=
 from last week's computer problems will be virtually complete and the Atla=
ntis astronauts likely will be cleared to undock as planned on Tuesday.

"From a data standpoint, there are a couple of things we want to look at," =
Ridings said. "We obviously haven't used the thrusters on the Russian segme=
nt since we had this (computer) issue. And so before we undock, which requi=
res having our computers on the U.S. side and the Russian side talk to each=
 other, we're going to do some checkout on (Monday).

"The current plan is to go over on Russian thruster control and just hold o=
ur nominal ... attitude for 45 minutes or so, in which the thrusters have t=
o fire to hold that attitude. And then we'll have checked out the communica=
tions at a very detailed level, make sure the thrusters are still talking t=
o the computers and prove to ourselves we've done everything we can in orde=
r to undock safely."

The shuttle astronauts today are gearing up for a fourth and final spacewal=
k to complete the activation of a powerful rotary joint on the right side o=
f the station's main solar power truss that was installed last week along w=
ith the new S4 solar arrays. The solar alpha rotary joint, or SARJ, is desi=
gned to slowly turn outboard arrays like a huge paddlewheel to keep the sol=
ar blankets face-on to the sun. An identical joint on the left side of the =
main truss turns the port-side P4 arrays.

Flight controllers plan to put the starboard SARJ through its paces Monday.

"The flight control team is going to do some checkout a little bit at the e=
nd of the day, they're going to turn on the busses, make sure they work, we=
're actually going to move the SARJ just a tiny bit, five degrees, we're no=
t going to rotate all the way around. So we'll do a little bit of check out.

"We don't want to do it during crew sleep. Moving the SARJ, as you might im=
agine, creates a torque, it's a big joint. Because we haven't done the (att=
itude control) test, handover to the Russian segment to try out the thruste=
rs, we don't want to create a lot of torque during crew sleep just in case =
it all doesn't work out the way we want it to and we've got to wake up the =
crews."

On Monday, "we'll put the SARJ in an auto-track mode where it tracks the su=
n continuously," Ridings said. "We're going to do that kind of integrated w=
ith our attitude control plan. So if we see a very large torque in our cont=
rol moment gyros, we've got a plan in place to hand over and have the orbit=
er control attitude for us and then do our thruster test and then go ahead =
and get back to our normal CMG attitude control."

Before the SARJ can be activated, spacewalkers Steve Swanson and Patrick Fo=
rrester must verify the operation of a toothed gear drive motor called a dr=
ive lock assembly and remove a final few launch restraints. During initial =
checkout of the SARJ last week, flight controllers discovered commands to D=
LA-1 were actually going to DLA-2 and vice versa.

Before beginning the SARJ work,Swanson and Forrester plan to install a tele=
vision camera stanchion. After the SARJ activation is complete, the spacewa=
lkers will stow a shuttle payload bay mounting pin called a drag link and i=
nstall a rail stop on the end of the robot arm mobile transporter rails tha=
t run along the forward face of the S3/S4 truss segments.

Turning to a variety of assembly get-ahead tasks, Swanson and Forrester pla=
n to route a computer network cable along the outside of the Unity module t=
hat eventually will allow commands to be sent to Russian systems from the U=
.S. segment of the station. After that, the spacewalkers will adjust an S-b=
and antenna system, open a newly installed hydrogen vent valve to permit th=
e future operation of a new U.S. oxygen generator and tie down a debris shi=
eld.

Airlock egress is scheduled for 12:38 p.m. For identification, Forrester's =
call sign is EV-3 and his suit features vertical dashes on the legs. Swanso=
n's call sign is EV-4 and his spacesuit is marked with diagonal dashes. Ast=
ronaut James Reilly will serve as the spacewalk coordinator inside the shut=
tle Atlantis. Cosmonaut Oleg Kotov will assist Forrester and Swanson in the=
 Quest airlock module.
