The ibmtts componant, the TTS engine itself, is proprietary, as it has
ever been in its various incarnations. Despite this unfortunate fact,
and despite some unfortunate resulting issues we cannot ourselves
readily address, it remains the most asked for computer voice. You may
know this voice by some of its other tradenames, such as Viavoice or
Eloquence. The core code is the same in all of these.

Furthermore, our docs clearly state this. I don't understand your point,
therefore.
