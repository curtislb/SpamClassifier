If it's Darwin specific then I want it split into a Darwin-specific
change.

Sez you. The existing code works, and works well on all
but one class of broken systems (*BSD).

Please do not modify existing working code, just fix
the specific problem. Don't get creative here.

That's a Darwin bug (IMHO). Their credentials system is now
non-POSIX and now non-standard.

When are they planning to fix that ?

No, I want the change I asked for - a modified
sys_setgroups that works for *BSD.

If Darwin is broken after that, then let's push for
them to fix their code.
