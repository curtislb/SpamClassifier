Judge Restricts Movement
Of  Nazi-Looted Painting
Associated  Press


PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- A federal judge on Friday granted a request  by the 
estate of a late Jewish art dealer to stop an elderly German baroness  from further 
moving a painting that it claims was looted by the Nazis. 
U.S. District Judge Mary Lisi also ordered Maria-Luise  Bissonnette, who 
inherited the painting and now lives in Providence, to permit  representatives 
from Max Stern's estate to inspect the artwork and ensure it is  being stored 
properly and in appropriate condition. 
The Canadian foundation that inherited Mr. Stern's estate filed a  lawsuit in 
federal court in Providence last year to reclaim the 19th century  painting, 
"Girl from the Sabiner Mountains," by Franz Xaver Winterhalter. The  painting 
was auctioned under duress after the Nazis forced Mr. Stern to close a  family 
gallery in 1937 under the German government's anti-Jewish laws, according  to 
the suit. 
The painting was acquired by Ms. Bissonnette's stepfather, Karl  Wilharm, and 
was later inherited by the woman. Lawyers for the plaintiffs say  Ms. 
Bissonnette secretly rushed the painting to Germany after learning the  estate was 
considering a lawsuit. Ms. Bissonnette said last week that she and  her family 
had done nothing wrong. 
Judge Lisi on Friday said Ms. Bissonnette could not move the  painting again 
without court permission. The two sides had been negotiating but  have reached 
an impasse, Samuel Zurier, a lawyer for the estate, told the judge.  Also 
Friday, Ms. Bissonnette's local lawyer withdrew from the case because of  
differences of opinion with his client.

An Impasse in Italian Talks Over Return of Artifacts
By ELISABETTA POVOLEDO
May 26, 2007

ROME, May 25 ? After months of intense discussions, negotiations between a New York antiquities collector and the Italian government have bogged down over a demand that she never be pursued by Italy again, several people close to the talks say.

Italy is seeking the return of nine artifacts from the collector, Shelby White, contending that they were looted from its soil.

Lawyers for both sides had been optimistic earlier this year that a deal could be struck. But an impasse developed over Ms. White?s insistence that in exchange for the objects, the Italian Culture Ministry grant her immunity from legal action of any kind and promise not to go after anything else she owns or acquires in the future, people familiar with the talks said.

Italian officials do not suggest that Ms. White or her husband, the financier Leon Levy, who died in 2003, knowingly bought artifacts whose provenance was suspect. But they say that forgoing potential investigations of any suspected wrongdoing in the future would essentially allow tomb robbers and dishonest dealers to traffic with impunity.

Restricting an inquiry would be tantamount to ?collaborating with the pillaging,? an Italian official who is following the negotiations asserted in an interview. He said he did not want his name used because both sides had agreed not to discuss the negotiations until a formal agreement had been struck.

Ms. White?s spokesman, Fraser Seitel, declined to discuss the specifics of the situation, but said that Ms. White ?remains hopeful that an accord will be reached.?

Over three decades Ms. White and Mr. Levy amassed one of the world?s finest private collections of classical antiquities. Some two dozen pieces in their collection are on view in the new Greek and Roman galleries at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, which were inaugurated last month. Mr. Levy and Ms. White, who is a trustee of the museum, are said to have donated about $20 million to create the galleries, whose centerpiece, a vast Roman-style court, bears their names.

Some Italian negotiators had hoped that a pact could be announced in advance of the Met opening ? one of the biggest events of the spring art season ? to heighten awareness of the looting of archaeological sites. (Some critics of Italy?s aggressive pursuit of foreign collections say that it has relied more on negative news media exposure than on moral suasion.)

Last November the Italian Culture Ministry presented Ms. White with a list of more than 20 pieces in her collection that its investigators had tracked to dealers who Italy says have been linked to looted antiquities. (The list was narrowed to nine during the negotiations.) Those dealers include Giacomo Medici, an Italian antiquities dealer who is appealing a 2004 conviction in a Rome court for dealing in illicit archaeological artifacts, and Robin Symes, a London dealer under investigation here who has not been indicted.

Italian officials say that Ms. White is under no legal obligation to return anything but that they hope to appeal to her sense of fairness. They cite recent agreements with the Met and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, which both transferred title of rare objects to Italy after being presented with evidence that they had been looted from there in recent decades.

Italy is also negotiating for the return of antiquities from the Princeton University Art Museum and the Cleveland Museum of Art. But talks have broken down with the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles. Several of the pieces Italy is demanding from the Getty originally belonged to Barbara and Lawrence Fleischman, another important collecting couple.

Adding to the pressures on the Getty, a former antiquities curator at the museum and an American dealer have been on trial in Rome since 2005 on charges of conspiring to acquire looted artifacts. The outcome of that trial and Ms. White?s negotiations with Italy have been avidly awaited by the tiny network of antiquities dealers in the United States and abroad.

Italian officials and archaeologists say that other collectors who have purchased artifacts in recent years from the galleries and dealers that are under Italian scrutiny may have cause for worry about their investments.

?If you try and resell the objects, the cultural ministry could start an injunction, and if you try to give them to a museum, it risks being asked to give it back,? said David Gill, a professor of archaeology and ancient history at the University of Wales in Swansea. ?You can?t be remembered as a great benefactor.?

In a 1999 study Mr. Gill and Christopher Chippindale, another British archaeologist, wrote that 93 percent of the objects in an exhibition of Levy-White artifacts at the Met had no established provenance.

Gold Bathtub Worth $1M Stolen From Japanese Hotel

May 30, 2007 1:43 p.m. EST

Shaveta Bansal - AHN Staff Writer

Tokyo, Japan (AHN) - Police in a Japanese city are trying to uncover the mystery behind the disappearance of a 176-pound bathtub lined with 18-carat gold. The bathtub, which is worth nearly $1 million, went missing on Wednesday from a men's bathroom in a resort hotel.

According to the police, officers went to the Kominato Hotel Mikazuki Wednesday after the hotel's staff reported the golden tub was missing. An examination of the bathroom revealed that the chain that fixed the bathtub to a door in the bathroom had been cut off.

However, police found no sign of dragging on the floor, an indication that more than one person might have been involved in the theft.

According to local media reports, the tub, which was flanked by two crane statues facing each other, was located in a shared bathroom on the 10th floor of the hotel. A similar tub in the women's shared bathroom is still in place, a police spokesman told BBC news.

Guests were allowed to use the tub for free, but the luxury was available only for a few hours in the afternoon.

Prosecutor narrows charges in art heist
05/31/2007
By TRACY KENNEDY

LITCHFIELD - A state prosecutor on Wednesday narrowed the charges against a New Milford man accused of stealing and destroying about 30 paintings worth thousands of dollars and setting a fire to a Warren home to cover the burglary.
New information was filed against Matthew Stenton, 30, 126 Willow Springs Road, substituting second-degree arson for the first-degree arson count and dates of the alleged crimes were set out in detail by Assistant State's Attorney Dawn Gallo.
"Specifically the second-degree arson is a charge used when a suspect sets fire purely to cover up a crime," Gallo said.
Charges that were not changed include first-degree larceny, two counts of third-degree burglary, two counts of tampering with evidence and first-degree criminal mischief.
Stenton pleaded not guilty to the charges.
Stenton was arrested by state police at Bantam Superior Court on May 17. He remains in state custody at New Haven Correctional Center, unable to post a $150,000 bond.
Attorney Christopher Cosgrove represented Stenton at Wednesday's hearing in Litchfield Superior Court. Stenton is expected to hire attorney Reka Ludanyi to represent him at his next court appearance June 20.
Gallo filed a motion to obtain swabs of Stenton's saliva to compare his DNA to chewing gum, blood and hair samples taken at the crime scene. Stenton admitted to stealing the paintings because he was desperate for cash, according to an arrest affidavit. The paintings included works from American artists Jack Frankurter, Charles LeClair and the late Max Gunther of Switzerland, police said.
It took two trips to take all of the artwork, Stenton allegedly told police. He also took bottles of liquor and set a fire igniting a roll of paper towels on the stove, but chickened out when he saw the flames and threw a large fur blanket on top of the fire, according to police. He burned numerous paintings in an outdoor burn barrel, according to the warrant.
Stenton sold five paintings for $800, according to the warrant. The dealers reported their purchase to police after seeing a flier advertising the theft in a shop.

Suspect arrested, charged in theft of 1823 atlas worth $60,000
May 31, 2007, 3:02 PM EDT

NEW CITY, N.Y. -- A former curator at the Rockland County Historical Society was arrested Thursday and charged with stealing the society's $60,000 antique U.S. atlas.

Rebecca Chen, 50, of Highland Park, N.J., complied with a prearranged surrender at Clarkstown police headquarters and was arraigned in Town Court on a charge of second-degree larceny, said Detective Robert Schine.

Police reported last week that the book had been recovered and a suspect identified, but her name was not made public until Thursday.

Schine said that on April 22, Chen took the 1823 book, "A New American Atlas," from a storage area at the Historical Society in New City, where she had worked for several years until last fall.

"She basically just walked out with it," the detective said.

The atlas, published by Henry Tanner, is one of the earliest American atlases with large maps of the separate states.

Once the theft was noticed, dealers in antiquarian books were notified. Christopher Lane of the Philadelphia Print Shop called police when he received an e-mail from Chen about the atlas.

"He was a great help," Schine said.

Police asked Lane to arrange a viewing of the book, and when Chen came to the shop with it, the Clarkstown detective was there to confront her.

"She seemed a little surprised," Schine said Thursday. Asked whether she expressed any regret for the theft, he said, "Whenever you get caught, you regret it."

He said he did not know of any particular motive for the theft.

Chen was currently employed at the William Trent House Museum in Trenton, N.J., the detective said. She was allowed to surrender because she did not seem to be a flight risk and arresting her in Philadelphia would have meant extradition proceedings, he added.

"She cooperated with us and we decided we would let her turn herself in," he said.

Chen did not have a lawyer in court Thursday and no plea was entered, Schine said. She was ordered held on $5,000 bail for another court appearance Monday, by which time a public defender was to be assigned to the case.

CASA DE SUBASTAS INICI? VENTA DE PATRIMONIO ROBADO AL PER?
jueves, 31 de mayo del 2007

    Haciendo caso omiso al pedido del Estado peruano, la casa de subastas Christie?s, empez? la subasta de cuadros y piezas arqueol?gicas, las cuales seg?n las autoridades peruanas no cuentan con ning?n tipo de documentaci?n que acredite su legalidad en territorio estadounidense.
    PEDIDO PERUANO

    El Per? ya hab?a condenado el tr?fico internacional de piezas de arte de sus culturas precolombinas y pidi? a las firmas Christie?s y Sothebys detener dos anunciadas subastas en Estados Unidos.

    La directora del Instituto Nacional de Cultura (INC), Cecilia B?kula, explic? el mi?rcoles que desde 1822 la ley peruana establece la propiedad de todas las piezas de arte prehisp?nicas de territorio peruano. Es por ello que toda pieza sacada del pa?s, sin documentaci?n, es considerada ilegal.

    B?kula indic? que esperaba que la casa de subastas entienda que el pedido peruano se ci?e a un derecho de posesi?n, ya que las piezas en territorio extranjero no cuentan con ning?n tipo de documentaci?n que acredite la conformidad que le hubiera brindado el Per?, adem?s la directora del INC implor? a la buena voluntad de la empresa.

    LA SUBASTA

    Pero a pesar del pedido del Per?, mediante el consulado en Nueva York y la Embajada en Washington, la casa Chritie?s inici? hoy la subasta de diversas piezas arqueol?gicas patrimonio exclusivo peruano.

    ?Es una gran perdida el inici? de esta subasta. Ya estamos coordinando con el INC para iniciar una acci?n judicial en vistas a poder recuperar las piezas subastadas las cuales ahora est?n en poder de los compradores?, manifest? la c?nsul peruana en Nueva York, El? Pel?ez.

    Pel?ez a?adi? que voceros de Christie?s indicaron que poseen documentaci?n que acredita la legalidad de la posesi?n de las piezas art?sticas peruanas; documentos que solo mostrar?an mediante v?a judicial.

    En total son 35 piezas de arte precolombino peruano de culturas preincas como Chav?n, Chim?, Paracas, Mochica, Huari y Nazca, en materiales como oro, plata, cobre y cer?mica, cuyos precios base van desde los 600 hasta los 35.000 d?lares. Unas de las piezas m?s importantes son un manto de la cultura Paracas y una m?scara de la cultura Wari, valuadas seg?n los estadounidenses entre US$ 5 mil y US$ 35 mil d?lares. El Vaso Cupisnique tambi?n fue subastado, a pesar que se habl? de un compromiso con la Canciller?a del Per? para que sea devuelto en un acto de buena fe.

    Entre las piezas subastadas tambi?n se encuentran cuadros de la escuela cuzque?a de los siglos XVII y XVIII, los cuales est?n valuados entre los US$ 12 mil y US$ 30 mil d?lares.

Detienen a ladr?n de arte sacro, en Atizap?n
martes 29 de mayo de 2007

Atizap?n, M?x.- Un presunto ladr?n dedicado al robo de art?culos sacros fue detenido por polic?as municipales de Atizap?n cuando sal?a con varios art?culos y una bolsa de dinero que hab?a extra?do de las limosnas y las alcanc?as de la iglesia Sagrado Coraz?n de Jes?s, en la colonia La Ca?ada.

De acuerdo con los informes, efectivos locales a bordo de la unidad AG-731 realizaban su patrullaje por la calle Gorri?n, de la mencionada colonia, cuando se percataron de que dos sujetos forcejeaban a las afueras de la iglesia por un costal y una bolsa de dinero.

Al percatarse de la presencia policiaca, Ra?l Hern?ndez, alias ?El Calacas?, de 32 a?os de edad, intent? darse a la fuga lanzando al suelo el costal que llevaba, dejando al descubierto los art?culos sacros, un video proyector y una bolsa con dinero que hab?a robado minutos antes.

Al ser alcanzado por los uniformados, el hamp?n intent? defenderse con un desarmador, pero, de una certera patada en el estomago, fue sometido por uno de los polic?as.

Una vez asegurado, Ra?l Hern?ndez reconoci? que se introduc?a a las parroquias, donde permanec?a hasta su cierre, para despu?s robar con toda tranquilidad los art?culos sacros y venderlos a iglesias de otros municipios.

Asimismo, una de sus v?ctimas lo identific? plenamente y asegur? que era el mismo sujeto que un d?a antes le hab?a robado 16 mil pesos y dos relojes, por lo que fue trasladado ante el Ministerio P?blico, donde tiene ya dos averiguaciones previas en su contra por el delito de robo con violencia.

Removal of cultural relics older than 1911 banned
2007-05-29 20:17:44

BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is to ban individuals taking cultural relics predating 1911 out of the country, amid efforts to strengthen the protection of cultural heritage, a senior cultural heritage official said on Tuesday.

    "Previous regulations stipulated that cultural relics predating1795 could not be taken across the border by individuals. However, the base line is going to be adjusted to 1911," said Shan Jixiang, director of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage (SACH).

    "The end of Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), China's last feudal society, is a convenient social mark for Chinese archaeologists," Li Peisong, vice director of the SACH's Museum Department, told Xinhua.

    The year 1911 was almost 100 years ago, which accorded with international practice that defines cultural relics protection based on centennial marks, Li said, noting the smuggling of China's cultural relics abroad had long been serious.

    Shan said the new regulation, which banned more cultural relics from being taken out of the country, would be promulgated before the end of this year.

    It also stipulates that important cultural relics produced before 1949 and major ethnic minority relics before 1966 could not be removed, except those taking part in overseas exhibitions, Shan said.

    Ethnic minority relics, especially those with distinct ethnic features, enjoyed great international popularity, said Tala, director of the Institute of Cultural and Historical Relics and Archeology of north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

    "Traditional Mongolian women's headgear decorated with red coral, turquoise, pearl and precious metals, are treasures of the Mongolian ethnic group and have long been favored by overseas collectors. Some have been lost overseas due to the lack of legal protection," said Tala, himself of Mongolian ethnic origin.

    Tala said headgear, saddles and other costumes could be sold to affluent private collectors for millions of yuan on the global market because the materials from which they were made were hard to find, especially after 1966.

    He said Mongolian cultural relics could not be easily identified as herders still used traditional silver bowls at home, some of which were very old and are easily bought and smuggled by private collectors.

    Laws and regulations say the removal of all cultural relics should first be approved by the State Council, or China's cabinet, and they must go through the port designated by the government and declared to Customs.

    Chinese experts estimated that more than 10 million Chinese cultural relics have been lost overseas.

    According to the Chinese Culture Relics Society, most of the cultural relics were stolen and smuggled out of China before the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949.

    The lost treasures include paintings, calligraphy, bronzeware, porcelain, oracle bone inscriptions and ancient books and records.

Bedard's boyfriend tells jury that he misjudged Olympian girlfriend's family
May 29, 2007 - 19:54

By: SIDHARTHA BANERJEE

MONTREAL (CP) - The boyfriend of Olympic champion Myriam Bedard told his theft trial Tuesday that he was a good friend to the artist he is accused of robbing but never should have trusted his girlfiend's family.

Nima Mazhari says his biggest mistake was assuming Bedard's family was as reliable as her when they agreed to go into business together in Quebec City.

"They were not reliable people," Mazhari told the jury. "They'd rather spend their time riding on the bike paths rather than working."

Mazhari is accused of stealing 20 paintings by Ghitta Caiserman-Roth between 2001 and 2003 and is charged with theft and possession of stolen goods worth a total of $100,000.

The trial has been tinged with elements of a family feud as Bedard family members and friends of the Olympian have all testified of their dislike of Mazhari and his questionable influence on Myriam Bedard.

Bedard's father testified last week that he would never have sent an anonymous letter to Caiserman-Roth's daughter in January 2004 if he had been able to rekindle a relationship with Myriam, who had ignored him for a year.

The letter led to the criminal charges against Mazhari.

Marzhari fired back on Tuesday.

He described how he and Myriam Bedard had moved to Quebec City in 2002 with plans of starting up a small business and purchasing real estate.

Mazhari said the family had agreed to help run their 50-seat coffee shop in Quebec City but Myriam Bedard's father and other family members pulled out quickly, leaving the couple stuck with a three-year lease and all other costs.

The cafe was only open 34 weeks, Mazhari said.

"I only knew Myriam, I didn't know her family," Mazhari testified, calling his assumptions about the Bedard family a huge error of judgment. "For me, Myriam is an angel. I could always count on her."

Mazhari also said he had an excellent relationship with Caiserman-Roth before she suddenly became very ill in November 2001.

Mazhari had lived in her Montreal home and shared a studio with her until December 2001, when they parted ways. Even after the separation, he continued to help her by taking her to hospital appointments. He saw her last in April 2002 and Caiserman-Roth died in 2005.

Mazhari couldn't say whether he'd personally seen any of her paintings, photos of which were deposited as evidence.

"I saw a lot of her paintings," Mazhari told the 10-woman and two-man jury. "I can't say if I had specifically seen one."

But when Superior Court Justice Wilbrod Decarie asked whether a signature at the bottom of one of her paintings meant an artist considered it her work, Mazhari answered yes.

"But I don't know why she signed it," he said about one painting of sunflowers. "For an artist the calibre of Ghitta, it was the work of a beginner."

He told the jury Caiserman-Roth liked his "dominant and masculine" character and that he inspired an intellectual exchange that changed her paintings.

The trial continues Wednesday.
