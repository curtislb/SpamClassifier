> Parrot::Configure::runstep() is the only subroutine in  
> Parrot::Configure() that is still not covered via the tests in t/ 
> configure/ or t/postconfigure/.  No test has yet been written in  
> part because this is a subroutine which is not really well  
> positioned in its current package.  Everything else in  
> Parrot::Configure has to do with initial configuration; runstep()  
> has to do with *re-running* a step after Configure.pl has already  
> completed.  It's a tool that some Parrot developers use (Patrick  
> Michaud has spoken up for it), but is not used by make.
>
> Additional problem:  Parrot::Configure also has subroutines named  
> runstep() and _runstep().  Ideally, any refactoring would include  
> less confusing names.
>
> Because runstep() runs after Configure.pl, any tests for it should  
> go into the t/postconfigure/ directory.
>
> So the task is to write unit tests for Parrot::Configure::runstep()  
> and, if appropriate, to refactor it, with that refactoring possibly  
> including renaming and/or relocating the subroutine.
