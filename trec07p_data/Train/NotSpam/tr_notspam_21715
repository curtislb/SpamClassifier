Hi Greg,

  Thanks for filling me in on Slackware. I will first look into the
double talk lt. I kind of figured serial would have to be my obvious
choice, however I jsut wanted to make sure. These systems are older (not
ancient) but bottom linie they more than likely have a few serials on
them.

  As far as the software part goes, are there any other alternatives to
speakup, so at least I can have a taste of a few if I should ever need
another one. It is just kind of up to me to I guess you could say "fend
for myself" on this course since the school really doesn't know what is
best for me and never has had a visually impaired person in their
networking course. I wish things woud work out of the box but we know
about that.

Thanks,
Cody
