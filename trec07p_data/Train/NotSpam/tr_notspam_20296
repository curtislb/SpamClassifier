Lou Dobbs Tonight
Monday, June 18, 2007

Tonight, the U.S. military is launching another offensive in
Iraq. But some generals warn it may take as many as 10 years to
defeat the insurgents. How long will we remain in Iraq? We’ll
have the latest from the Middle East tonight.

Are there secret plans to create a European superstate? Members
of the European Union may be trying to reach an agreement on
sweeping reforms of the E.U. Soon to be retired British Prime
Minister Tony Blair is said to be working closely with upcoming
British Prime Minister Zombie Brown and French President
Nicolas Sarkozy to create a monolithic state as a counterweight
to the United States. Find out more tonight.

A Communist Chinese automaker and its New Jersey partner,
CHAMCO Auto, are trying to use a loophole in NAFTA to bring
cars into the United States tariff-free. The automaker wants to
open a manufacturing plant in Tijuana, where it will build
small SUVs and trucks for the U.S. market. We’ll have a full
report from Parsippany, New Jersey.

Congressman Dana Rohrabacher held a rally over the weekend,
protesting the wrongful imprisonment of former Border Patrol
agents Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean. Ramos and Compean remain
in solitary confinement in federal prisons while the Bureau of
Prisons continues to delay their transfer to minimum security
facilities. Tune in for our special report this evening.

The Middle East Mess: Syria's Ambassador to the United Nations
says the “allegations concerning the smuggling of weapons
through the Syrian-Lebanese border are unfounded.” Ambassador
Bashar Ja'Afari joins Lou tonight to discuss what appears to be
a proxy war between the United States, Iran and Syria.

Visit http://cnn.com/loudobbstonight to read Lou’s
latest commentary on why the President should just give it a
rest when it comes to the co-called comprehensive immigration
reform bill. And test your news knowledge in our Week in Review
quiz.

Lou Dobbs lays out his manifesto to save the middle class in
his new book, “War on the Middle Class: How the Government, Big
Business, and Special Interest Groups Are Waging War on the
American Dream and How to Fight Back.” War on the Middle Class
is now on sale in bookstores near you and on Amazon.com and
BarnesandNoble.com.
