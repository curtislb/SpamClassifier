Hey hey!!  Progress rocks!!!  I got speech-dispatcher running if I 
invoke it from the command line with sudo speech-dispatcher.  My log 
is being sent to stdout, but I'm sure the next time I run it, it'll 
be logged to a file.  I'm assuming it's just because I haven't had 
speechd.log.  Now for the million dollar question.  What is the 
easiest way to get speech-dispatcher to start as a service when I 
boot.  Can you give me an example of proper rc.d syntax to do 
this?  Do I then have to run some kind of update?  Thanks again, in 
advance for the help.


Guy
