I thought the whole point of static linked binaries was to remove the  
exact problem you're talking about.
My understanding (which apparently is wrong) was that when you static  
link a binary, it includes *all* libs required for execution of that  
program, regardless of how many/what version/where they're located/  
etc.  It obviously makes the executable larger, but prevents the  
problems you're talking about not having the proper lib versions  
installed.
My understanding was that the whole static link thing was  
specifically supposed to solve this exact problem.
What am I missing here?

This isn't how they work according to what you're saying, but  
according to what I've read (admittedly, it's been a while, so things  
may have changed) this is the expected behavior.
