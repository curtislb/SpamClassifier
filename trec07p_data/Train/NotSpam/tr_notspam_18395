Tridge, that is indeed very interesting! Thanks for reminding me to
investigate that.

I have read through your features, and would like to ask one question:

CTDB is built on top of a cluster filesystem layer. Any cluster
filesystem layer (be it GFS2 on openAIS or OCFS2 w/Linux HA, both moving
towards openAIS) already has a reliable messaging and locking layer
beneath it, and almost always, a fail-over, DLM, election etc solution
too.

At first glance, it appears you're reimplementing those infrastructure
services then on top of the clustered fs again.

Would it not be more efficient to directly use the same services the fs
is also using ...?

More specifically, because this is what we're currently working on
moving the Linux HA project (the clustered resource manager parts at
least) towards - have you investigated whether openAIS can meet your
requirements as well?


Regards,
    Lars
