You need festival-freebsoft-utils package called in debian.

I think that NAS can bring you additional problems. Because if run NAT
then will blocked audio device from it and applications can play if the
can communicate trought NAS only. It is my feel I'm not sure complete.


    H> Any tips and hints?
Maybe will be possible use the alsa-oss package but I don't know how in
this situation. That's a question for Hynek Hanke.
