ET/PT</B>

<B>PARIS PROFITS?!?</B>
Is Paris Hilton about to cash-in <i>big time</i> on her <i>jail
time</i>? And why are her neighbors so angry about what will
happen when she is released from jail? Showbiz Tonight with the
outrage and the controversy.

<b>A "THE VIEW" SHOCKER: MAN TO REPLACE ROSIE?</B>
So many people have been named as possible replacements for
Rosie O'Donnell on "The View." But now, Showbiz Tonight is
hearing that it could be a <i>guy</i>! We're digging for
answers to find out which dude, if any, will turn up on this
daytime talker!

<b>CELEBRITY SEX TAPES!</B>
Long before she went to jail, Paris Hilton got really, really
famous, mostly because of a sex tape! It put her on the map,
and she's not the only one! The Hollywood landscape is littered
with sex tapes, and they are not always bad for a career. From
Paris to Pam Anderson to even <i>Screech</i> from "Saved By The
Bell," Showbiz Tonight investigates celebrity sex tapes.

Showbiz Tonight's revealing interview with the front man for
