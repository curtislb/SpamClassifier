That is an idea. Pay expenses of band, including band members, roadies, etc. 
salaries. Release the music under a Free (and in my book, copyleft) license. 
This is certainly a benefit to the public.

I am more concerned with a Free license myself, rather than free of charge.

Even with a Free license, you could charge for gigs and merchandise, etc.

The thing is, if the music came with a Free license and I liked, I would 
happily pay the band for a CD. (Actually, I have been thinking recently that 
it might be a nice twist to go back to the "album format" for delivery of 
CDs. Basically, album size, materials, posters, lyrics, etc. with a CD inside 
instead of vinyl. Is it clear what I mean here?)

Again, for me, the crux of the matter is not whether they give it away or 
charge for it, it is whether it comes with a Free License.

This is effectively no more than a twist on the corporate or partnership 
model. Unless there is a Free license involved, what is to stop a sell out in 
a few years to the majors? (Leaving the majority of fans no better off than 
they are now.)

That is one option, but I think setting a price at which you will release a 
track with a Free license (say CC BY-SA for the sake of argument) is worth an 
experiment. If I can get some people together willing to record this way, I 
will run some experiments along these lines.
