Hi

We are noticing that a new Vaio laptop is extremely slow to boot
Debian. We thought it was PCMCIA problem an started without it, but it
still is slow from around the place that PCMCIA would have started.
Also the X11 is very sluggish. The laptop is noticeably slower than
other older desktop computers. 

Does anybody have any experience with this? We are looking for clue as
to what makes this happen. Windows XP does not have a boot problem.

Any hints much appreciated!

Preben
