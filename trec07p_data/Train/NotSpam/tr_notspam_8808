Just to provide some closure on this thread, let me add two comments:

1.  Spie's version of my sweep function:

diffid1 <-
function(h, id) {
     id <- as.factor(id)[ , drop = TRUE]
     apply(as.matrix(h), 2, function(x) x - tapply(x, id, mean)[id])
}

is far more elegant than my original, and works perfectly, but

2.  I should have mentioned that proposed strategy gets the
coefficient estimates right, however their standard errors need a
degrees of freedom correction, which in the present instance
is non-negligible -- sqrt(98/89) -- since the lm() step doesn't
know that we have already estimated the fixed effects with the
sweep operation.
