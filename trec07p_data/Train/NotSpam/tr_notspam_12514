"unambiguous under the law", but technical ambiguous. What character
encoding should be used?

IMHO "(c)" is the character representation of the copyright symbol,
and when you print it, you should substitute with the correct symbol,
as the "ff", "ffl", "fl", .. ligatures.

Anyway when the symbol is not printed, it should be written in some
other form (a sequence of bits, which are not law defined), so
IMHO any "obvious" representation should be valid.

IANAL
