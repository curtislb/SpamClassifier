Couldn't agree more. With the simplicity of speakup, its always there. Also 
even though orca supports gnome-terminal which can be used for command line 
stuff, for some reason I seem to prefer to switch to a text console and use 
speakup, and there are plenty of cases where I do use speakup rather than 
orca. Then there are those cases where orca doesn't work, what happens if my 
X configuration is messed up and gnome just doesn't start, etc.

As for compiling a kernel, yes I have done it, but having now used ubuntu 
where I had no great need to compile my own kernel, I probably would prefer 
not to go back to compiling my own.
