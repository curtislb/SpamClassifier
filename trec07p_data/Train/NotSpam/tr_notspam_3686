If you are going to register a spot in the vendor tree (vnd.) then you 
don't need the unofficial "-x-" any more, because you control the space. 
But if this is an open standard and not related to one particular 
company or group, then perhaps it's not the right place. "vnd" smells to 
me of the old days when every proprietary company had their own file format.

Having said that, we went for application/vnd.mozilla.xul+xml for XUL. 
Although that was a few years ago now.

Also (and I don't know anything about the technical side of how these 
packages work), isn't "sugar" just the name for the GUI? If I shipped an 
HTML app in one of them, isn't the string "sugar" inappropriate?
