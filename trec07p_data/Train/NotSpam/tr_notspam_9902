Hi all

It would be nice to have an interface such as Speechd-up for the Jupiter 
Screen Reader, see:
www.eklhad.net/linux/jupiter/index.html

Speakup apears to miss interesting features, or perhaps its documentation is 
not complete? For example, it's not able to make the entire shell session 
available for reviewing, and I become restricted to the 25 lines limit of 
the current screen.

Also, there's no way to program macros so that specific keys could read 
different parts of the screen, as well as custom settings for different 
apps.

There seems to be a command to read a text continuously (insert + r), 
however, it doesn't work fine here. It reads the first two lines of text and 
then stops reading.

Whether someone knows any solution for these problems concerning Speakup, or 
perhaps an alternate console screen reader that works with Softsynth, in 
particular ESpeak, I'll be grateful to know.

Cheers,
Cleverson
