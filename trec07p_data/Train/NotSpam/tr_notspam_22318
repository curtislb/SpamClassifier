Hi folks,

I'm trying to use the CPAN shell to install some modules from our
internal CPAN mirror.
I'm using a URL of the form ftp://MyCpanMirror/u02/CPAN/ , and I have a
valid .netrc configured with a user and password for the mirror box.

At first I was able to query/install modules easily, but then I did an
"install Bundle::CPAN", and now I can't log into my CPAN mirror. To be
specific, LWP and Net::FTP are attempting to use an anonymous login,
which is not allowed, instead of trying to log in via the user
information contained in .netrc.

I've read the docs for CPAN, LWP::UserAgent, and Net::FTP, but I don't
see how to change this behavior. I was under the impression that if a
.netrc was available, Net::FTP at least, would use it for
authentication.

Here is a snip of the CPAN shell output:

cpan[1]> install DBD::Oracle
CPAN: Storable loaded ok (v2.08)
Going to read /iu36/s01/.cpan/Metadata
  Database was generated on Fri, 22 Jun 2007 05:07:41 GMT
CPAN: LWP::UserAgent loaded ok (v2.003)
CPAN: Time::HiRes loaded ok (v1.52)
Fetching with LWP:
  ftp://MyCpanMirror/u02/CPAN/authors/01mailrc.txt.gz
LWP failed with code[404] message[Can't chdir to u02]
Fetching with Net::FTP:
  ftp://MyCpanMirror/u02/CPAN/authors/01mailrc.txt.gz
  Couldn't login on MyCpanMirror: User anonymous unknown.
Fetching with Net::FTP

  Couldn't login on MyCpanMirror: User anonymous unknown.
Fetching with LWP:

(I don't have access to the outside from this box)

What am I missing?

Thanks for the help!
