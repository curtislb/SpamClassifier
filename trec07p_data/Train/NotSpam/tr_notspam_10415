First off, we're not talking about free/non-free here; we're talking
about who controls the copyright of a glyph in a font. The
free/non-free nature of the glyph is dependent on how that work is
licensed, not the copyright status of the work.

Only if the depiction was a derivative work of the orignally
copyrighted work. Only trademark protects against the convergence of
unrelated works; copyright does not.

The question is whether or not that has been done. In order to talk
about that intelligently, we have to look at specific instances of the
symbol's use in a specific font within a specific package and the
process that resulted in creating the glyph.
