Some of the earlier posts on Strayform were very helpful,
but others are missing the point.  

What we would like to see is a new way that media is
created and funded.  It is designed to replace the
purchasing of CDs.  Buying CDs is inefficent.  With
current peer-to-peer technology their is no cost for
distribution.  The real value is in the process of
creation.  

So pay artists for creation.  Funding the creation process
has many benefits.  It is more efficent, resulting in
higher profits for artists and lower costs for consumers,
it removes the threat of piracy as a revenue drain on
artists, it allows fans to take part in the creation
process.
