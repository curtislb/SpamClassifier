A friend of mine is involved in a similar project called "64 Studio"

http://64studio.com/

whose focus is precisely a "tools up" free software artistic platform.
So I think this is already being worked on.

Unless what you meant was providing a body of artistic elements --
samples and music, for example -- in which case, I would suggest that a
more "open" solution would be to create a package of such work and offer
it to ALL of the free media-focused distributions.

Of course, if you're looking for money to support the project, you could
try proposing your idea to a commercial distribution. I believe that 64
Studio does plan to  go to a commercial support business model at some
point (I don't think they have money now) and of course, Canonical still
has capital. I don't see that being anywhere near as easy, but it might
work.

Cheers,
Terry
