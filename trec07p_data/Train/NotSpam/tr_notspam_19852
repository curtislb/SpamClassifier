Hello,
    Well, I personally like the Bash cryptic commands to some extent, and 
traditional Unix commands have been around for years.  But I can see your 
point.  As for a shell buffer, I find Emacspeak to be very useful in that 
regard--as well as being a very nice bit of software in general.  It's 
definitely not for everybody, though.
    I also love the console for the opertunities it provides for gaming 
under Linux--yes, I admit it, I do that sometimes.  Nethack, Adom, and the 
other Roguelike games work horribly under Windows, but with Speakup's 
ability to track the cursor and do so character by character and vertically 
as well as horizontally, they work quite well.  I have yet to see a 
graphical (or audio, for that matter) game for Linux which will work as 
well.
Yours,
Zack.
