Thanks for pointing this out. There is the citation:
@article{lindsey1999,
  title={On the use of corrections for overdispersion},
  author={Lindsey, JK},
  journal={Applied Statistics},
  volume={48},
  number={4},
  pages={553--561},
  year={1999},
  }

Which is the better (or ) best way to expand the existing model?
by adding some other relevant independent variables or by using other
more suitable model like "Negative Binomial Generalized Linear Model"?

Thanks!
