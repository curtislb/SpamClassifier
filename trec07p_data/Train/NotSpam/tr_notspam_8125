Hi All,

 

Hope you all had a great weekend.

 

I have a file:

 

Text.txt

--------

One

Match Not

Two

Match

Three 

Four

-------



Now I want to get only the line that has "Match" and not the line "Match
Not".

I used :

cat text.txt | perl -nle 'print $_ if (/Match/)&&(!/Match Not/)'

 

But I want to do that inside one regular expression. 

 

Regards,

Sarthak
