I am new to using R and would appreciate some advice on
which books to start with to get up to speed on using R.

My Background:
1-C# programmer.
2-Programmed directly using IMSL (Now Visual Numerics).
3- Used in past SPSS and Statistica.

I put together a list but would like to pick the "best of" 
and avoid redundancy.

Any suggestions on these books would be helpful (i.e. too much overlap,
porly written etc?)

Books:
1-Analysis of Integrated and Co-integrated Time Series with R (Use R) -
Bernhard Pfaff
2-An Introduction to R - W. N. Venables
3-Statistics: An Introduction using R - Michael J. Crawley
4-R Graphics (Computer Science and Data Analysis) - Paul Murrell
5-A Handbook of Statistical Analyses Using R - Brian S. Everitt
6-Introductory Statistics with R - Peter Dalgaard
7-Using R for Introductory Statistics - John Verzani
8-Data Analysis and Graphics Using R - John Maindonald;
9-Linear Models with R (Texts in Statistical Science) - Julian J.
Faraway
10-Analysis of Financial Time Series (Wiley Series in Probability and
Statistics)2nd edition - Ruey S. Tsay

Thanks.
