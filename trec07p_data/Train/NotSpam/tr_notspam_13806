My choice would be to replace the spaces with underline characters.
However, you indicated that you wanted space characters to be replaced
with ' _ ' strings--to each his own, I guess.  This little script
should do what you want (I hope).  Use at your own risk.

#!/bin/bash
#win2lin.sh
#converts Windblows file names to Linux file names
#Spaces in file names are translated to ' _ '
#upper case letters in file names are converted to lower case
#This script only performs conversions in the current directory--no
#directory tree traversal is provided.
#Use this script at your own risk.

function win2lin_func {
for i in *
do
  newname=`echo $i | tr [A-Z] [a-z] | sed "s/ / _ /g"`
  if [ "$newname" != "$i" ]; then
    echo Renaming \"$i\" to \"$newname\"
    mv -i "$i" "$newname"
  fi
done
}

#mainline code
#check for a single command line parameter

if [ "$#" != "1" ]; then
  echo Usage $0:
  echo $0 param/
  echo where param is the directory where files are to be renamed
  echo "(be sure to include the trailing /)."
  exit 1
fi

#process the file names
win2lin_func

#end of win2lin script

HTH, and have a _great_ day!
