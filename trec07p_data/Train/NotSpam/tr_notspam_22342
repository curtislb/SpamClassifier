Sounds like somebody goofed, and assumed that all CPAN mirrors allow
anonymous access. You probably need to file a bug report, but let's
see how far we can get first.

It's undocumented, but maybe try this:

  BEGIN { $CPAN::DEBUG = 512; } # FTP?

That's my impression as well. Does Net::Netrc work for you from the
command line, maybe something like this?

  perl -MNet::Netrc -lwe 'print join " ",
Net::Netrc->lookup("MyCpanMirror")->lpa'

If you're still able to use the ftp command to manually log in to your
mirror, you should be able to configure CPAN to use that, as a
workaround. I say you should, but I don't know how tenaciously it may
try to use Net::FTP (or whatever is broken) instead.

Good luck with it!
