I discussed this ticket with other participants in the recent hackathon in Toronto.  I am 
inclined to recommend that we not make any changes in Configure.pl's behavior as implied 
by the ticket, for a number of reasons:

1.  Configure.pl is a Perl script.  The truth value of the string 'no' in Perl is true.  Cet. par., in 
Perl if you want to negate something you 'undef' it or you assign it a value of 0 (or the string 
'0').  So the current behavior of the 'execcapable' option is consistent with Perl's customary 
behavior.

2.  In config/auto/jit.pm, $execcapable is set to 1 for Unix-ish operating systems and 
Windows and set to 0 for other OSes.  But if you want to set a different behavior, it appears 
to me that you can simply pass a value of 1 or 0 to the execcapable option.

3.  If we really thought we'd make extensive use of something equivalent to '--
execcapable=no', we could create a '--noexeccapable' option analogous to '--
nomanicheck' (see lib/Parrot/Configure/Options.pm).

4.  AFAICT from looking at Perl 5's Configure.sh, Perl 5 survives without a 'no' value for any 
of its configuration options.

In short, YAGNI.  What do others think?
