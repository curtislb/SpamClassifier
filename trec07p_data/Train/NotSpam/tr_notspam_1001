[0]reporter writes "According to a disturbing report just published by
Bloomberg, 'As the Kremlin gears up for the election of Putin's successor
next March, [1]Soviet-style controls are being extended to online news
after a presidential decree last month set up a new agency to supervise
both mass media and the Web.' However, unless the Kremlin pursues
Chinese-style/Turkish-style blocking of the Internet-Protocol addresses
of web sites like 'The Economist', even the Kremlin cannot control the
online media. If Putin pulled the plug on an anti-Putin web site inside
Russia, the anti-Putin web site could simply be migrated offshore to a
server in, say, the United States."

Federal regulator Mark Pryor, in a Senate Commerce Committee hearing, has
stated that [0]spyware distributors should face harsher penalties than
fees. His solution: imprisonment. "Federal Trade Commissioner William
Kovacic said most wrongdoers in the spyware arena 'can only be described
as vicious organized criminals. Many of most serious wrongdoers we
observed in this area, I believe, are only going to be deterred if their
freedom is withdrawn,' so it's important for the FTC to collaborate on
its cases with criminal law enforcement authorities, Kovacic said."

Earnest writes "A prank MySpace page has led to [0]a barrage of lawsuits
and the misuse of school resources as the principal targeted by the
pranksters attempted to find the perpetrators. In 2005, students at
Hickory High School in Pennsylvania created a fake MySpace profile of
principal Eric Trosch. As a result, the school's IT staff spent about 25
percent of his work time dealing with the issue and finding the culprits.
That's not all. 'Trosch kept at it, even taking measures that led to the
"cancellation of computer programming classes as well as usage of
computers for research for class projects." Now the basic educational
mission of the school was being compromised in order to keep students
from visiting these profiles during school hours (students were still
free to look at the profiles from home, of course).'"

[0]Andreaskem writes "A Carnegie Mellon University computer scientist
says transferring large data files, such as movies and music, over the
Internet could be sped up significantly if peer-to-peer (P2P)
file-sharing services were configured to share not only identical files,
[1]but also similar files. "SET speeds up data transfers by
simultaneously downloading different chunks of a desired data file from
multiple sources, rather than downloading an entire file from one slow
source. Even then, downloads can be slow because these networks can't
find enough sources to use all of a receiver's download bandwidth. That's
why SET takes the additional step of identifying files that are similar
to the desired file... No one knows the degree of similarity between data
files stored in computers around the world, but analyses suggest the
types of files most commonly shared are likely to contain a number of
similar elements. Many music files, for instance, may differ only in the
artist-and-title headers, but are otherwise 99 percent similar.""

situation last for some time. We are at absolute maximum production and
doing everything we can. The number of units that we have been able to
produce has far exceeded our hardware production in the past and the
production levels of a lot of our competitors but demand continues to be

Researchers at Georgia Institute of Technology have created a working
[0]prototype nanogenerator capable of generating as much as 4 watts per
cubic centimeter of continuous direct current. The generators are green
(to use), drawing power from natural motion in the surrounding
environment. They are based on non-toxic chemicals and should be safe for
use in biomechanical implants, but that's not their only potential use.
>From the article: "If you had a device like this in your shoes when you
walked, you would be able to generate your own small current to power
small electronics," Wang noted. "Anything that makes the nanowires move
within the generator can be used for generating power. Very little force
is required to move them."

mlimber writes "University of Colorado Law School professor Paul Ohm, a
specialist in computer crime law, criminal procedure, intellectual
property, and information privacy, writes about the [0]excessive fretting
over the Superhacker (or Superuser, as Ohm calls him), who steals
identities, software, and media and sows chaos with viruses etc., and how
the fear of these powerful users inordinately shapes laws and policy
related to privacy and digital rights."

[0]theodp writes "Reacting to an actor's do-it-yourself legal effort that
[1]triggered a reexam of Amazon.com's 1-Click patent, attorneys for
Amazon have fired back, deluging the USPTO with documents to review,
including Wikipedia articles. With the latest batch, Amazon's
[2]high-priced law firm even [3]requested that USTPO examiners review an
archived page of [4]Norm Quotes (yes, [5]Norm from Cheers) and [6]rule
that it does not invalidate CEO Jeff Bezos' 1-Click patent."

An anonymous reader writes "A robotics hobbyist has created what he
claims is the world's [0]smallest autonomous robot. The robot is half the
volume of the [1]robots produced by Sandia National Labs in 2001, moves
quite a bit faster, and was made using techniques and supplies accessible
to anyone." While Sandia Labs has had some time to improve on their
original designs, it's still pretty cool to see what one can do at home
as well.

Arun Demeure writes "Beyond3D has once again obtained new information on
[0]Intel's plans to compete against NVIDIA and AMD's graphics processors,
in what the Chief Architect of the project presents as a 'battle for
control of the computing platform.' He describes a new computing
architecture based on the many-core paradigm with super-wide execution
units, and the reasoning behind some of the design choices. Looks like
computer scientists and software programmers everywhere will have to
adapt to these new concepts, as there will be no silver bullet to achieve
high efficiency on new and exotic architectures."
