One of your list members, Ayo Kusamotu, from Lagos, Nigeria introduced
me to your listserv.  My name is Jeff Aresty, and I am a lawyer from
Massachusetts, and one of the founders of the virtual bar association,
Internetbar.org.  We are multidisciplinary and our mission is to open
paths to online justice, both economic and procedural.  Clearly, the
work of creative commons has great potential to do both.

Through May 15, 2007, we are registering young people (undergraduates,
graduates, and those within 5 years of their degree) to enter a contest
where the prize is to be the Reporter of the 6th International
Conference on Online Dispute Resolution, to be held in Hong Kong the
first week of December, 2007, all expenses paid.  The contest is
designed to organize a community that will explore how we build trust
online.  The contest url is www.internetbarcontest.org.   It is free to
register, and participate. Even if you are not eligible for the prize,
you can still join the community as a facilitator.  The contest runs in
two stages through the end of June, and then fifteen people will be
selected to write papers over the summer.  One will win the grand prize,
and the top five papers will be published as part of the Conference
proceedings.  

Thank you.

Jeff Aresty
