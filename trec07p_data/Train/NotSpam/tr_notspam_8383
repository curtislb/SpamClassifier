What type of system is this?

No, it is to avoid this issue with any function.  Any function used
without a prototype is a dangerous thing.

On such systems, the missing prototypes (after extensive tests are made
for finding the correct prototype header) should be provided by
libreplace, as it already does for many standard functions (for which a
reliable prototype is often found in the POSIX standard).
