SatCon Photovoltaic Inverters Installed at 1.1 MW SolarCraft Site




BOSTON, Jun 19, 2007 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- SatCon Technology Corporation(R)
(Nasdaq CM: SATC), a developer of power management and system
architecture solutions for the alternative energy and distributed power
markets today announced that its PowerGate(R) commercial grade inverters
have been installed as an integral part of a SolarCraft installed 1.1
Megawatt solar energy system at Paramount Farms, Inc., the world's
largest vertically integrated supplier of pistachios and almonds. The
installation, located in California's San Joaquin Valley, spans 8 acres
and is reportedly one of the largest single-site, privately-owned solar
energy systems in the United States. This solar system enables Paramount
Farms to generate enough clean electricity each day to power 300 average
homes. The new system will spare the air nearly 2,600 tons of harmful
greenhouse gases annually. Over the next 30 years, the air pollution
saved will be equivalent to driving over 176 million miles. 

SolarCraft, experts in solar system design and installation, was
responsible for the design and construction of the Paramount Farms
system. With over 4,000 commercial and residential installations to its
credit, SolarCraft has installed more solar energy systems than any
other company in California's North Bay. SolarCraft installs over 200
solar energy systems per year. 

"SolarCraft selected SatCon for this job because we have had a great
deal of success at many other commercial installations with this
inverter brand." stated Chris Bunas, Vice President of SolarCraft's
Solar Electric Division. "SatCon has become our main choice for
commercial inverters because of their high performance, ease of
installation and smaller overall packaging. So far, the two 500 kW
inverters at Paramount Farms have been performing beyond expectations." 

SatCon's PowerGate(R) Inverter series, ranging from 30 kW to 500 kW,
continues to gain acceptance as the Photovoltaic Inverter system of
choice. SatCon has delivered over 15MW of commercial grade inverters
this calendar year and is experiencing significant demand for its
inverter products.
