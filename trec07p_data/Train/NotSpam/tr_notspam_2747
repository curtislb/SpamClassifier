I tried this with VMWare Player. I was going to load up the Ubuntu 6.10 iso 
and install it on a virtual machine this way. I used easyvmx.com to generate 
the proper files and chose the ES whatever sound card it would use by 
default. Everything seemed to go OK until Orca loaded, and I got odd 
static-like noises instead of speech. I think sound is definitely broken 
some how in VMWare Player. I might uninstall that and try server instead.
