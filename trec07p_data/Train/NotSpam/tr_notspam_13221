Actually, although it's certainly possible that I missed some, I don't
believe I have missed any in the last year or more.  (Jeremy took some
that I had intentionally not checked into the soon-to-be-released
branch, but that's different.)

Yes, it's my fault.  I'm not debating that.  What caused it, though, was...

... my misunderstanding of this.  I made the change in my local tree but
I didn't check the change in to SAMBA_3_0_25 when I checked it into the
other two branches because you had said that SAMBA_3_0_25 was frozen and
I took that to mean that you did not want any checkins to that branch.
I now understand that frozen doesn't tell me not to check things in,
just that you will ignore those checkins for the release you are
currently working on.

Thank you!

I understand.  It's a royal PITA, but I understand.  And I do not
believe there are any current discrepancies in code that I've worked on
between the three branches.  Everything should, I think, be in sync.

Thanks again!
