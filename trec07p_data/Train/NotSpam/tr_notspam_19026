[0]pfaffman sends us word of a two-part article in LinuxInsider that lays
out to an audience of non-tech educators a [1]cogent argument for
[2]using F/OSS in schools. The piece was written by a University of
Tennessee professor for the education journal TechTrends. It makes the
case that proprietary software is inconvenient and that when schools
choose to use proprietary products they spend their constituents' money.
The article won't contain a whole lot of surprises for Linux initiates
(save perhaps some software recommendations for educational use), but
it's interesting to see these ideas presented so clearly to a wider, and
influential, audience."

driver who has been [1]fined $1000 for not paying a fuel tax when he
fills his tank with vegetable oil. Perhaps the funniest quote is this
one: '"With the high cost of fuel right now, the department does
recognize that a lot of people are looking for relief," said Reggie
Little, assistant director of the motor fuel taxes division. "We're not
here to hurt the small guy, we're just trying to make sure that the

StatisticallyDeadGuy writes "A University of Georgia scientist has
developed a statistical system that can, she claims, [0]predict the
outcome of wars with an accuracy of 80 percent. Her approach, applied
retrospectively, says the US chance of victory in the first Gulf War was
93%, while the poor Soviets only had a 7% chance in Afghanistan (if only
they'd known; failure maybe triggered the collapse of the USSR). As for
the current Iraq conflict: the US started off with a 70% chance of a
successful regime change, which was duly achieved — but extending the
mission past this to support a weak government has dropped the
probability of ultimate success to 26%. [1]Full elaboration of the
forecasting methodology is laid out in a new paper (subscription required
— link goes to the abstract). Some details can be gleaned from her
[2]2006 draft (PDF)."

[0]javipas writes "The [1]controversial message published by Linus
Torvalds ([2]mirrored) in the Linux Kernel Mailing List was from the
beginning to the end an open attack to Sun and its Open Source strategy.
Linus criticized Sun's real position on GPL, and claimed that Linux could
be dangerous to Sun. Upon his words, "they may be talking a lot more
[about Open Source] than they are or ever will be doing." [3]Jonathan
Schwartz's blog has been updated today with a post that is a direct
response to Linus claims, but in a much more elegant and coherent way.
Sun's CEO notes that "Companies compete, communities simply fracture",
and tries to explain why using GPL licenses is taking so long."

to set up a human rights committee to review the impact of Yahoo!'s
operations in places like China. The interesting proposals are numbers

news comes on the heels of jailed Chinese reporter Shi Tao, [5]suing
Yahoo! for its involvement in his conviction, and Google's [6]rejection
of a similar proposal. The anti-censorship proposal was submitted by the
same groups (several New York City pension funds) as the Google proposal.
The proxy statement also includes the Board's recommendations — "strongly
oppose[ing]" both proposals — with explanations of their reasoning."

which is interesting because it's written from the [0]perspective of

from the slightly faster page loading, Ars didn't find much to recommend
it to Windows users. 'The modest increase in rendering performance is
hardly worth the deficiencies, and Safari's user interface simply doesn't
provide the usability or flexibility of competing products. If the folks
at Apple think that providing Windows users with a taste of Mac OS X
through Safari is going to entice them to buy a Mac, it's going to take a
better effort than the Safari 3 beta. Even if the final release is more
polished and completely bug-free, it still won't be as powerful or
feature-loaded as Opera or Firefox.'"

efficient programs such as, a debugger, memory profiler tools and above

[...] Though they lack cognition and memory, the study shows plants are

the surface."

An anonymous reader writes "An article on OSWeekly.com discusses a few
things that [0]Microsoft could learn from OSS and Linux. 'As Microsoft
continues to understand that open source does not mean they cannot
generate a decent profit, I honestly wonder if they will eventually "get"
that releasing MS Office code to the open source community is their only
option. Since the whole threatening to sue thing will be met with the
same fan base response, just like the RIAA, it is certainly not a wise
decision. And if Microsoft thinks Open Office is a pain now, try suing
people over it, then see how many people refuse to buy their products.'"
