Roland:

Thanks for your reply.

I have sort of pay my "dues" with statistics and doing the hard math
reading of
Proofs.

Years ago reading lots of books on Multi-variate Methods such
As Principal Components, Cluster Analysis, Discriminant Analysis,
Multi Dimensional Scaling(MDS), Optimization both LP and QP and more.

At this point, want to jump in avoiding all the
Mathematical proofs and just apply R and the packages for what I want to
do.

So as example, How to set-up a dataset (timeseries of returns),
formatted so I can do
A cluster Analysis and nicely format a dendrogram.

I am hoping the right books can show me, not concerned about
which distance measure and cluster method (i.e. Ward's, Single Linkage
etc)
Done this and know based on type of data what works best.

Just some simple books to jump start me right into practically applying
R.


Thanks for your response.

Regards,
Neil

as one other message says, it depends a lot on your ideas what you want
to do with R. And, I'd like to add, how familiar you are with
statistics.
One book I am missing in your list is Venables / Ripley: Modern Applied
Statistics with S. I can highly recommend it.
If you are going to buy yourself only one book, then I would say: buy
Venables/Ripley

Best,
Roland
