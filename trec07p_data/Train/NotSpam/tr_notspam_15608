   When the expected behavior of a block of code is to throw warnings,
   then tests should be written to make sure those warnings are, in
   fact, being thrown.  We can do this in our Perl 5- based tests by
   using Parrot::IO::Capture::Mini to capture the warnings, then using
   Test::More::like() to determine if we got the warnings we expected.
   In r18763 I took this approach and applied the following patch to
   t/tools/pmc2cutils/05-gen_c.t . . .

This seems like a lot of trouble just to keep dead code in the codebase.
Is there some reason not to yank the useless methods?
