#!/usr/bin/perl
  use strict;
  use warnings;

  my $phase = 0;
  my $s;
  while (<>) {
      if    (0 == $phase) {
          /^\s*typedef union\s*(?:\{\s*)?$/
            and ++$phase and $s = $_;
      }
      elsif (1 == $phase) {
          $s .= $_;
          if (/^\s*}\s*(\w+)\s*;\s*$/) {
              'CHANNEL_INFO_T' eq $1
                and ++$phase and last;
              $s = '';
              $phase--;
          }
      }
      else { die "ugly phase($phase)"}
  }
  $phase == 2 and print $s;
__END__

(untested)


But a real parser would also catch variants such as

typedef union {
    TYPE_T type;
   MODE_T mode;
}
CHANNEL_INFO_T;
