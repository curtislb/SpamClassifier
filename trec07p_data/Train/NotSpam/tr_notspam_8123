Hi Derell,

I don't think it's correct to use -Werror-implicit-function-declaration
within the configure checks. Because the configure result now may
differs between the normal and developer build.

The correct fix would be to use a AC_CHECK_DECL() or AC_HAVE_DECL()
for the specific function.

(But I like the exit -> return cleanups :-)
