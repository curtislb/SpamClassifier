You certainly know exactly what you want.

perldoc -f readdir 	# how to read a dir and grep for files only

perldoc perlvar 	# for an explanation of @ARGV and processing of 
command-line args.

perldoc -f sprintf/printf 		# For a way to nicely format some headers 
or
perldoc -f format			# For an alternative way to format some headers.

See how you get on then, if your stuck, mail the list showing what 
you've tried and your'll get more pointers then.

Good luck,
