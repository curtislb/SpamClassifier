 From Discovery to Delivery: The Impact of University/Biotech Licensing
Agreements on Access to Medicines in the Developing World

MONDAY, APRIL 9, 2007, 6:30 p.m., Pound Hall 335, Harvard Law School
(hors d'oeuvres and refreshments at 6:15)

Each year, 10 million people die because they did not have access to
existing medicines. The high price of patented medicines is a major
contributor to this problem, especially the developing world. 
Universities, dedicated to the public good, research and patent many of
the most needed medicines but license their patent rights in exchange
for royalties to pharmaceutical companies that develop drugs and block
access to low-cost generic alternatives in the developing world.  Join
noted scientists, university administrators, IP lawyers and public
health experts in a discussion of how university licensing practices
can be changed to promote greater global access to
university-researched medicine.

A panel discussion featuring:
  • Isaac Kohlberg, Associate Provost & Chief Technology Development
Officer, Harvard University
  • Amy Kapczynski, Intellectual Property Attorney, Founder of
Universities Allied for Essential Medicines
  • William Rodriguez, Associate Director of International Operational
Research at the Harvard Medical School Division of AIDS
  • Liza Vertinsky, Associate, Wolf Greenfield & Sachs P.C.
  Moderated by:
  • Talha Syed, Fellow, Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy,
Biotechnology, and Bioethics

Sponsored by
Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy
Biotechnology, and Bioethics in collaboration with Ethics, Law and
Biotechnology (ELaB)
Harvard Law School chapter of Universities Allied for Essential
Medicines (UAEM)
