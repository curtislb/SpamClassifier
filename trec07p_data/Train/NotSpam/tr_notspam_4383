HEADLINES:
Senate Leader: Pres. Bush in “State of Denial” over Iraq
President Bush is in a "state of denial" over the war in Iraq and must listen to the majority of Americans who want U.S. combat troops to leave.  That’s what Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said today.  Reid laid out a Democratic plan for what he called a "responsible, strategically driven redeployment" of most American troops as part of a long-term strategy he said would have a better chance of leaving behind a stable, democratic Iraq than Bush's ongoing deployment of more soldiers and Marines.  He said Congress should give Iraqis "tangible, measurable and achievable benchmarks" to meet, and demand a regional conference with Iraq's neighbors to help settle the conflict.  Reid criticized a Friday speech in which the president asserted that despite last week's bloody wave of bombings, U.S. troops were making progress against the sectarian warfare that has plagued Baghdad and that "the direction of the fight is beginning to shift."  "The White House transcript says the presi!
 dent made those remarks in the state of Michigan," Reid said. "I believe he made them in the state of denial."  Meanwhile, White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said Reid and his fellow Democrats are in denial about the impact of a U.S. withdrawal, which she said would amount to a "defeat" that would condemn millions of Iraqis to slaughter.  "They are deluding themselves if they think that offering a surrender date is in the long-term strategic interest of this country," Perino said. And she said the "talking points" Reid derided are in fact "principled stands."

Virginia Tech Students Return to Campus, Classes after Massacre
"A lot of sadness, a lot of sorrow, a lot of silence," is how Tina Grimshaw, a shuttle bus driver, described the atmosphere on the Virginia Tech campus today.  A week after a massacre that changed their campus forever, students at Virginia Tech returned to classes.  An increased police presence -- described as visible but not overly dramatic -- is on the campus, where a shooting rampage claimed the lives of 32 students and faculty April 16. Mental health professionals wearing purple arm bands and faculty, staff and student volunteers wearing yellow ones marked with "May I Help?" are also available to assist the community.  But before classes began, many people attended a memorial service for the first two victims of the shootings -- Ryan Clark and Emily Hilscher.  Dozens of students gathered around the West Ambler Johnston dormitory, where the two were shot at that time a week ago.  Te school is being very liberal regarding students who don't show up. They're being given the!
  option of not returning for the remainder of this term and taking their present grades. There are no official numbers on how many are returning and how many have chosen not to.  But Grimshaw said some students were ready to get back to normal, though she thought that "normal" would take awhile to return. Others, she said, just want to finish the semester and go home.

Former Russian President Boris Yeltsin Dead
Former Russian President Boris Yeltsin, whose defiance of the 1991 Soviet coup attempt left him poised to lead a democratic Russia after the Soviet Union's collapse, has died at the age of 76, a Kremlin spokesman confirmed today.  His death was caused by sudden heart failure, medical sources told Interfax news agency.  Yeltsin resigned from office on Dec. 31, 1999 and appointed Vladimir Putin as president.  Since then, he's led a quiet life in a cottage outside of Moscow, appearing in public only for a few tennis tournaments.  Yeltsin's funeral will be held April 25, and a national day of mourning has been declared for that day, a statement from the Kremlin said.  Yeltsin became the first democratically elected president of Russia in 1991 and two months later put down a coup attempt against Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.  One of the images most associated with Yeltsin is that of him sitting on a tank during the raucous street rallies that marked the coup attempt.

Minimum Wage Hike Inches Closer After Tax Break Agreement
Key leaders in the House and Senate have agreed to a package of tax breaks for small business that should ease the passage of the minimum wage bill.  Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charles Rangel of New York announced Friday that they had come to an agreement on tax breaks for small business totaling about $4.8 billion.  The Senate Finance Committee had originally proposed tax breaks of $12 billion while the House approved a smaller $1.3 billion package. The difference had been a stumbling block between the House and Senate, stopping them from sending a minimum wage increase to the president for his signature.

Some of the Fastest Thumbs in the Land
Next time you see someone typing out a text message, don't assume it's frivolous -- that could be a champion in training.  Right now many are congratulating 13-year-old Morgan Pozgar.  On Saturday, she was crowned the first ever National Texting Champion, and awarded $25,000 for her blazing thumbs.  300 competitors vied for the prize, being tested for both speed and accuracy.  Contestants were shown phrases on overhead plasma screens and asked to type them on their handsets exactly as they appeared without typos or abbreviations.  Pozgar's winning phrase was, "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocios! Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious. If you say it loud enough you'll always sound precocious."  She had a text message speed of 42 seconds for a 151 character phrase, earning her the title and the cash.
