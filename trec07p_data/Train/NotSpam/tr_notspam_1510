Lou Dobbs Tonight
Friday the 13th…of April, 2007

Tonight, we’ll feature more reaction from Baghdad on the
suicide bomber that infiltrated the heavily fortified Green
Zone. And did Karl Rove intentionally delete sensitive e-mails
relating to the firing of eight U.S. attorneys? We’ll tell you
what’s in store for Rove and the Bush administration tonight.

Georgia passed one of the nation’s strictest anti-illegal
immigration laws, set to take effect this summer. But business
groups and contractors are already complaining about the
requirements. We’ll report on what actions some states have
taken in the face of federal inaction and whether or not those
laws will stand.

The state of Illinois could pass legislation as early as today
that will grant driving certificates to illegal aliens. Critics
of the bill question why illegal aliens should be given the
right to drive legally in America. Tennessee passed similar
legislation, but later suspended the law after the program was
riddled with problems. We’ll have a full report tonight.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez announced the United
States would place tariffs on Chinese coated paper imports in
an effort to help American workers. But Business Week has
uncovered the biggest beneficiaries are not American workers at
all…they’re private equity firms with close ties to the White
House. Tonight, we’ll follow up on the report.

In tonight's tribute to the men and women who serve this
country in uniform, we bring you the story of Air Force Tech
Sgt. Scott Williams. He was awarded the bronze star for his
distinguished service as a team leader in Iraq.

tonight’s show and to test your news knowledge in our Week in
Review quiz.

Lou Dobbs lays out his manifesto to save the middle class in
his new book, “War on the Middle Class: How the Government, Big
Business, and Special Interest Groups Are Waging War on the
American Dream and How to Fight Back.” War on the Middle Class
is now on sale in bookstores near you and on Amazon.com and
BarnesandNoble.com.
