[ CCing Dan, since he wrote the original startup notification and  I'm 
interested in his opinion ]

We decided a while ago to use X  for window management and I don't see a 
reason to revisit that decision. Etoys should respect the multiple 
windows semantic (which I know you are working on, thanks).

To reassure you, we are not going to use X as an IPC (as people have 
done in the past), since that gets unbelievably ugly: that's where dbus 
has his role in the shell -> activity instance communication.

If there is a _SUGAR_ACTIVITY_ID property the window is an activity, 
otherwise it's a raw X window. So I think it actually solves the problem.

The shell must know the activity and the bundle id as soon as an 
activity window is displayed, otherwise it can't represent it properly 
in the home. Relying on the dbus service for this was very fragile and 
introduced races which was hard or impossible to solve properly.

Window management should work using X communication. Mixing dbus and X 
there just introduce races and confusion. If we was going down the "dbus 
for window management" route then I'd agree with you, but we aren't.

Now, that's really a bad hack. I don't want to show a random icon on the 
screen and than replace it when the DBUS service appear... it just suck.

The startup phase is completed when the window appear on the screen, not 
when the dbus service appear. That's also exactly how startup 
notification is implemented in GNOME btw.
