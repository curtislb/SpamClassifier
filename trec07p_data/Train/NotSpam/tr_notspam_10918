Good Morning,

I would like to run a question by your technical support team.

My employer is currently using Samba server (Samba 2.0.5a)

 Solaris 8 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-4.

Samba is configured to communicate through port 139.

However we have been asked to change Samba configuration in order to 

change the communication from port 139 to 445.

I am not entirely sure what porcess/es or steps needed for this
alteration.

I would like to know if  there is any procedure or recommendation so I
would be able to

Implement this change.

In advance, I would like to thank you for all your assistance.

 

Regards,

George Sadathian
