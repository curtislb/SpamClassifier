Sacramento Bee
Prison package hailed

At signing ceremony, rehabilitation policy seen as a major shift.

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and legislative leaders promised a new era =
for California corrections Thursday, one where the prison system's =
operative philosophy of the past two decades -- warehousing inmates -- =
will give way to offering them a chance at rehabilitation.

At a signing ceremony on the Capitol's east steps, Schwarzenegger hailed =
the prison package contained in Assembly Bill 900 as representing a =
"monumental shift in how we manage prisons."

In the short term, the state is hoping that the $7.9 billion plan that =
adds space for 53,000 prison and jail beds will dissuade federal judges =
from imposing population caps that could lead to early releases of =
inmates from California's jampacked prisons. In the long run, the hope =
is that it will keep prisoners from reoffending.

"Our job is far from done," Schwarzenegger said. "We have made the =
commitment to provide the infrastructure we need to relieve =
overcrowding. And now we must follow through on the rehabilitation =
programs that we need to make sure that inmates who get released can =
lead productive, law-abiding lives so that our communities will stay =
safe."

At the end of the 2005-06 budget year, only 10,572 of the 171,900 =
inmates incarcerated at that time were enrolled in academic education =
programs and only 7,953 were in vocational programs. About 8,500 more =
prisoners were in drug treatment programs.

Under the bill Schwarzenegger signed Thursday, all of the proposed =
40,000 new beds expected to come on line in the California Department of =
Corrections and Rehabilitation will be linked to mental health, =
vocational, education and drug-treatment programs.

Joan Petersilia, head of the University of California, Irvine, Center =
for Evidence-Based Corrections, said that AB 900 represents a "historic =
turning point for California," where 172,344 inmates are being housed in =
spaces designed for about half that many.

"We're going to build the space so people can learn jobs," Petersilia, =
who has worked as a consultant to the state prison system for the past =
three years, said at the signing ceremony. "We're going to increase =
their literacy rate. And we can provide good, solid substance abuse =
treatment programs."

Petersilia added, however, that "we should not underestimate the =
difficulty of implementing this package." In an interview afterward, she =
cited staff vacancies throughout the prison system, its culture of =
punishment-over-rehabilitation and skepticism in the public mind as =
critical barriers the state has to overcome to make the program work.

The plan calls for building space for 16,000 beds at existing prisons, =
16,000 more at 30 or so "re-entry" centers to be located around the =
state and 8,000 additional beds at new correctional hospitals. The other =
13,000 beds are slated for county jails, which are now releasing 18,000 =
inmates a month due to overcrowding.

Sacramento County is one of about 25 communities around the state that =
have expressed an interest in housing a re-entry facility. Its district =
attorney, Jan Scully, said in an interview she believes the public will =
support the idea.

"I think that citizens are always concerned about whether or not it's in =
their own neighborhood, so I think there is going to have to be a lot of =
discussion, and the community is going to have to feel that it's in =
their best interest to have such a facility close by," Scully said. "I =
think it's going to be important for the Board of Supervisors to hold =
public hearings and those kinds of things. There's going to be a lot of =
homework to do first."

Scully described herself as "a big proponent of re-entry opportunities" =
and said she would help to get one located in Sacramento.

The bill breaks the construction program into two phases. The second can =
only proceed if the state proves it has met the rehabilitation =
requirements in the first, 32,000-bed phase of the program.

The 16,000 new beds would go into 10 existing prisons around the state =
to replace emergency housing in which triple-bunked inmates are sleeping =
in gyms, dayrooms and classrooms.

AB 900 also includes legislative approval of Schwarzenegger's emergency =
plan to ship 8,000 inmates -- against their will, if necessary -- to =
out-of-state prisons. The transfer plan has been held up by lawsuits =
filed by the California Correctional Peace Officers Association and =
Service Employees International Union Local 1000.

Another provision in the bill will convert 4,000 existing prison beds =
into drug-treatment slots for inmates.

The bill contains an urgency provision that allows corrections officials =
to begin construction immediately. Schwarzenegger said Thursday he =
expects the construction to be completed within 18 months.

Opponents of the bill such as state Sen. Gloria Romero, D-Los Angeles, =
said it represents just another prison construction plan for the state =
and that the administration missed a chance to incorporate a major =
sentencing overhaul and parole changes into the package, items that =
opponents said might reduce the need for new incarceration spaces in the =
future.

Schwarzenegger pledged Thursday that he is open to discussing sentencing =
and parole changes later in the legislative session. He also said he =
will continue to push a plan to relocate 4,500 nonviolent female =
offenders to community-based facilities to open up prison space to more =
dangerous offenders.

Assembly Speaker Fabian N=FA=F1ez, D-Los Angeles, said nobody got =
everything they wanted in AB 900. In signing the bill, Schwarzenegger =
made "a contract with the people of California" and "the Legislature is =
going to be watching" to make sure the prison agency follows through on =
the rehabilitation benchmarks, N=FA=F1ez said.

"This would have been an easy problem to solve if we were simply willing =
to build prison after prison, like houses on a Monopoly board," =
N=FA=F1ez said. "But we weren't."

Assembly Republican leader Mike Villines of Clovis said the package =
represents bipartisan cooperation at its finest.

"Republicans and Democrats put their differences aside," he said. "We =
put California first."
