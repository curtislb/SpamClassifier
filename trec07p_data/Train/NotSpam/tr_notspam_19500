I was thinking along the lines of the old Sound Blaster's "say" 
command for DOS, where you could have the computer say whatever.

With doubletalk, any text sent to the serial port will speak.
In linux you could do echo "hello" > /dev/tty0 or cat file.txt > /dev/tty0
but speakup will send everything on the console to speech anyways ...

If you want a "say" command you can make a script that does exactly
the same thing, accepting the text as input param and routing the input
to the serial port, or make a "sayfile" that does the same thing but 
accepting filename as input and doing cat within the script.
