Hi,

Thanks for the help.

Good news: I have figured out the problem. It seems there is a slight
IDL glitch - the "LoadOrderGroupKey" parameter is not a pointer type.

I have successfully created a Windows service from my Linux machine. I
am planning to add the deleteservice functionality as well and needs to
do some cosmetic changes.

I've downloaded bazar and created a local branch. 

Will keep you updated regarding an incoming patch.

Thanks a lot!

Danny.
