Speaking only for myself, of course, I read nothing in your messages for which you should even consider an apology.  I don't know whether the Speakup code should be rewritten or not, but it sure does seem that, as with much else, non-visual access is very much an afterthought at best for the makers of Linux kernels.

Subject: An apology


> Hello,
>     I would like to apologize for my recent tone on this mailing list.  The topic of Speakup support being taken out of Gentoo sources was, I suppose, a rather sensative one for me.  I have had a great deal of success with it.
>     The irony in all this, I suppose, is that I recently switched away from Gentoo-sources and took up Vanilla-sources.  This was because the CVS version of Speakup used in Gentoo-sources has problems with my synthesizer: problems fixed by my manual patching in of a more recent version.
>     I am confedent that in time we can work out a solution.  I'm not a technical person in a lot of ways: far be it from me to say what will work best.  I was rather strident in defending my points, and that wasn't called for.  Deedra, in particular, I apologize for beating a dead horse and not being more far-sighted.  
>     I'd hope something can be decided upon which will satisfy everybody here.  Maybe a complete rewrite of Speakup is called for, I don't know.  
> I remain, nevertheless, yours,
> Zachary Kline.
