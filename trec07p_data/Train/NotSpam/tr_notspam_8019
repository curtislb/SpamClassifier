I followed the advice given in the message referenced above.  I don't 
think the GFDL addresses how you define the whole work, but I don't see a 
set of manpages as substantially different from a set of HTML files; 
there, makeinfo puts the @copying information into a comment in each file, 
but the GFDL text and Invariant Sections themselves don't go in every 
file.  I presume this conforms to the FSF understanding of the 
requirements, given Texinfo's NEWS file:

	*** IMPORTANT NEWS FOR ALL AUTHORS OF TEXINFO MANUALS ***

	As of version 4.2, Texinfo has a new command @copying to define the
	copyright and copying permissions for a manual.  It's important to
	switch to using it as soon as possible (as in your next release),
	because the historical method of doing copyright permissions using
	@ifinfo failed to output copyright information in the HTML (or XML)
	formats.

I'd be glad if the FSF would simply move to the GSFDL when it comes out, 
but I have no hope of that either.  The most I might hope for is getting a 
statement regarding moving text between manuals and doc strings extracted 
from source code.

If RMS however wishes to get the new invariant section "Free Software and 
Free Manuals" (from the last printed edition of the GCC manual) added to 
the development versions of the GCC manual, he's listed as having Write 
After Approval access and can submit a patch for that himself; as I said 
at <http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=13573#c8> I have no 
interest in merging that particular change.
