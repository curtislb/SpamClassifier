Hi everyone,

I realise this is not a direct speakup thing, but I figured you all might 
have some ideas about the sound card problems I'm having.

A friend of mine recently upgraded my machine to Debian 4 and speakup 
4.6.18.  All went well and, as well as my previous cut and paste problems, 
the upgrade fixed some previous sound card problems I was having.  The 
new problems came in when he tried to change my default sound card from my 
Ensoniq card to my Soundblaster Live card.  He followed the instructions 
in the Debian and alsa how-tos.  However, the system will now not load up 
the sound card drivers and will not record.  The arecord error is:
3:(snd_pcm_open_noupdate) Unknown PCM default
arecord: main:550: audio open error: No such device

Does anyone have some experience and/or ideas on what we can do? My first 
priority is to just have both cards working again.  And then having the SB 
Live as default would be a bonus.

Thanks all.

Amanda
