7:34 AM, 6/18/07, Update: Final tests on tap to verify computer recovery, S=
ARJ operation=20

Ground controllers tested a new solar array rotation system overnight in pr=
eparation for switching over to normal sun-tracking mode. Russian ground co=
ntrollers, meanwhile, are gearing up for a critical test of the revived com=
puters in the Russian segment of the space station to make sure they can co=
ntrol the lab's orientation with rocket thrusters as required after the shu=
ttle Atlantis departs.

If all goes well, NASA's Mission Management Team is expected to give shuttl=
e commander Rick Sturckow and his crewmates permission to seal the hatches =
between the station and the orbiter late today in preparation for undocking=
 Tuesday.

Here is a schedule of today's activities (in EDT and mission elapsed time; =
includes rev. N of the NASA television schedule):

10:42 AM...10...15...04...Atlantis undocks from space station

The primary goal of year's first shuttle mission was to install a new set o=
f solar arrays, known as starboard, or S4, arrays on the right side of the =
station's main power truss, along with a solar alpha rotary joint, or SARJ,=
 designed to rotate the huge panels like a giant paddle wheel to keep them =
roughly face-on to the sun. An identical SARJ and another set of solar arra=
ys - P4 - were attached to the left side of the power truss last September.

Each SARJ uses two redundant motors called drive lock assemblies, or DLAs, =
to turn a large gear, which in turn rotates the outboard solar arrays at up=
 to 4 degrees per minute. The DLAs were moved from their launch positions a=
nd engaged with the drive gear during spacewalks by the Atlantis astronauts=
. Overnight, the DLAs were powered up and briefly tested.

"We powered up and looked at both drive lock assemblies, there are two of t=
hem, and we have what we call a string one (command chain) and then a secon=
d string that's redundant," said station Flight Director Holly Ridings. "We=
 have separate boxes and commands for redundancy requirements.

"So we looked at both of those drive lock assemblies, moved them around to =
different positions. Of course, we can't see them, but they're physically m=
oving and we get telemetry feedback and so we checked out those DLAs on bot=
h strings and made sure they were all working properly. And they were, so t=
hat was good news. After that, we actually moved the SARJ just a little bit=
, 5 degrees, again on each string.

"We were looking at the video really closely and it's pretty slight, you ca=
n't really see it, but we've got telemetry feedback. We were looking at our=
 momentum and you could see the change in momentum, it was between 4 and 5 =
degrees, which corresponded with the (commanded) 5 degrees, so we knew that=
 it was working properly.

Later today, flight controllers plan to initiate auto-track mode in which t=
he U.S. computer system computes the position of the sun relative to the sp=
ace station as the lab circles the Earth and drives the solar arrays to kee=
p them properly oriented.

"That will be a big step," Ridings said. "You'll obviously be able to see t=
hat. We're really excited about that."

After that, ground controllers will test a so-called switch-over program to=
 "move from one string over to the second redundant string if something goe=
s wrong. We want to make sure that works."

But the most critical test of the day comes later this morning. The space s=
tation's orientation will be changed by U.S. control systems to properly or=
ient the combined shuttle-station vehicle for a water dump by Atlantis. At =
that point, flight controllers plan to switch attitude control over to the =
Russian terminal computers and rocket thrusters to put the station back in =
its normal orientation.

The station uses a combination of control systems - shuttle thrusters, U.S.=
 control moment gyroscopes and Russian thrusters to control its orientation=
. During normal operation between shuttle visits, the CMGs provide stabilit=
y and pointing control. But large adjustments require the Russian thrusters=
, which are controlled by so-called terminal computers in the Russian segme=
nt of the station.

Last week, the command module's three terminal computers and three central =
command-and-control computers crashed when something affected the operation=
 of secondary power supply surge protectors. After three days of around-the=
-clock troubleshooting, Russian engineers came up with a fix and asked stat=
ion commander Fyodor Yurchikhin and flight engineer Oleg Kotov to use jumpe=
r cables to bypass the suspect power supply switches. The repair worked, an=
d the computers were reactivated Friday and Saturday.

Today, the flight control team will carry out a final major test to verify =
the attitude control system is working properly.

"We're going to go to orbiter vernier (thruster) control in order to do a w=
ater dump and then after that, we'll hand over to what we call RS (Russian =
segment) thruster control where we're firing those thrusters and our termin=
al computer in the Russian segment of the service module is using the algor=
ithms in order to fire them in the correct sequence," Ridings said. "And so=
, that's a big step in our checkout of the computers to make sure everythin=
g's working correctly, one of the things we really want to see before we go=
 and undock the next day.

"After that, we're going to do another little step, which is called U.S. th=
ruster only, where we still use the Russian thrusters but instead of the te=
rminal computer being the brains of the operation, we're actually going to =
have the U.S. GNC (guidance, navigation and control) computer being the bra=
ins of the operation. And that's a mode we spend a lot of time in nominally.

"So we're going to go from Russian thruster control to USTO and then we'll =
have satisfied ourselves the thrusters are working properly, talking direct=
ly to the (terminal computer) and then talking through the (terminal comput=
er) over to our GNC. And then we should be good and ready to undock."

While the SARJ is activated and the attitude control system is checked out,=
 the Atlantis astronauts will enjoy a half-day of off-duty time before sayi=
ng farewell to their space station colleagues in a brief ceremony scheduled=
 for 6:23 p.m. After that, hatches between the two spacecraft will be close=
d in preparation for undocking Tuesday.
