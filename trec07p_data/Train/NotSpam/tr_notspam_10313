As I understand it, if you have access to the server's keytab, then  
in principle you can forge credentials for anyone, including non- 
existent users (but only for that server).  What you suggest would  
prevent someone faking the PAC data in a credential, and from  
inventing a fake user, but they could still fake the credential.

In other words it wouldn't stop John Jones from presenting a fake  
credential for Sam Smith that just happened to include the real PAC  
data that Sam would have had if it were really Sam.

Am I missing something?
