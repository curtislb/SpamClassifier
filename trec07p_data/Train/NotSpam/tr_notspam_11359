Several years ago, I wrote an R package RinS
which embeds R in S-Plus as a regular "chapter"
and then allowed one to call R functions from S-Plus
in the form

  .R('rfunction', x, y, z)

I haven't looked at it for a long time, but the basic
architecture should still work. What might need to be changed
are some #defines, etc. in the C code.

It is much more flexible and easier approach than exchanging data via
files and creating scripts in for R to execute.
