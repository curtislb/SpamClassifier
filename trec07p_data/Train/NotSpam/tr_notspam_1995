Intellectual Property and Access to Essential Medicines: The Impact on
Global Health

Global Justice and Universities Allied for Essential Medicines are
  hosting a panel discussion on the interrelation between intellectual
property, patents, and access to essential medicines.  The panel will
consist of three distinguished speakers from different disciplines:

Thomas Pogge, Professor of Philosophy. His philosophical work has
recently been on issues of global justice, and on the existence of
extreme poverty as a human rights violation.  He has also looked at
issues of justice in healthcare, examining how the benefits of
pharmaceutical innovation can be better distributed to the world's
poor. He is currently working on solutions to this ethical problem, one
of which is a special type of patent. 

Dr. David Hoos, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology, Mailman School of
Public Health.  Dr. Hoos is the coordinator at MSPH for the Fogarty
International Center of the NIH funded Columbia University – Southern
Africa AIDS International Training and Research Program. In addition,
Dr. Hoos is a member of the MTCT Plus Secretariat at MSPH, with
responsibility for drug procurement for this international HIV/AIDS
treatment program. He is responsible also for several other new
international training and technical assistance initiatives at MSPH
primarily in HIV/AIDS related areas. Dr. Hoos is also involved in a
HIV seroprevalence study of acute psychiatric patients in KwaZulu
Natal, South Africa.  Dr. Hoos is also serving on a number of
international panels related to scale up of international HIV/AID
treatment, including the Procurement Advisory Group to the Global Fund
for AIDS, TB and Malaria, and the HIV/AIDS workgroup for the UN
Millenium Development Goals.

Bhaven Sampat, Professor at the Mailman School of Public Health:  Dr.
Sampat's research centers on the economics of biomedical innovation,
the law and economics of the patent system, and science policy. His
current projects examine the political economy of the National
Institutes of Health, the effects of patents on access to medicines in
India, the interactions between patent laws and FDA regulation in the
pharmaceutical industry, the determinants of patent quality in the
U.S. patent system, and challenges to evidence--based medicine in
contexts of rapid technological change.

Please join us for the panel and the following Question and Answer
session.
Refreshments will be served. Please join us! email kjc2106@columbia.edu
