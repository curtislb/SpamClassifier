Well, the above is total Greek to me.  However, I must say that there is 
absolutely no reason why Bacula would every accompany OpenSSL in any sense of 
the the English meaning of accompany that I am aware of, nor is Bacula in the 
same directory tree as any OpenSSL shared object unless you consider 
everything is under root thus everything on the server is in the same 
directory "tree".

By the way, just to be clear, I consider all this (not you guys but these 
license difficulties) to be a real pain.  As long as the code is Open Source 
(i.e. I can get it, see it and modify it), I have no problem with it being 
linked with Bacula. 

I modified the Bacula GPL license at Debian's request to remove the issue you 
find with OpenSSL, however, that created a much bigger problem for me -- it 
made Bacula in violation of other peoples GPLed code that is used in Bacula.  
As a consequence, I removed all Bacula modifications to the GPL making Bacula 
clean -- it violates no one's license.  Each person, distributor, packager 
can decide for himself whether or not to enable Bacula to use encryption.  At 
the current time if encryption is turned on, Bacula expects an OpenSSL 
interface.

I much appreciate that Debian has for a long time packaged Bacula as part of 
the Debian system.  If it were only a simple matter of keeping that clause 
rather than a question of violating other people's copyright, I would keep 
the clause despite what Fedora/Red Hat think/want.  So, sorry if this causes 
you problems, but I prefer to be in compliance.

Best regards,

Kern
