Changes and additions:

   SR-12 (05/11/07): Hail damage repairs virtually complete; Atlantis, exte=

02:30 p.m., 05/24/07, Update: Flight plan, launch window update=20

Work to ready the shuttle Atlantis for launch June 8 on a long-delayed spac=
e station assembly mission is going smoothly at pad 39A, officials said tod=
ay, with four days of contingency time still available to handle unexpected=
 problems.

A two-day flight readiness review is scheduled for May 30 and 31 to assess =
launch processing, to review work to repair the shuttle's hail-damaged exte=
rnal fuel tank and to set an official launch date. A news conference is pla=
nned for the afternoon of May 31 with shuttle Program Manager Wayne Hale, L=
aunch Director Mike Leinbach and Bill Gerstenmaier, chief of space operatio=
ns at NASA headquarters. As of this writing, the target launch time is 7:38=
:00 p.m. on June 8.

The goal of Atlantis' mission is to attach the 36,000-pound S3/S4 solar arr=
ay segment and rotary joint to the right side of the space station's main p=
ower truss, to extend the new arrays and to activate the solar alpha rotary=
 joint, or SARJ, to permit the arrays to track the sun in concert with the =
P4 arrays on the left side of the truss.

The astronauts also plan to complete the retraction of two solar array blan=
kets that must be folded before the P6 segment, which provided initial powe=
r to the station, can be moved to the left end of the power truss later thi=
s year. The crew of the shuttle Discovery ran into major problems retractin=
g one side of the array - P6-4B - in December and procedures have been modi=
fied for the still-extended P6-2B blankets.

In addition, Atlantis will deliver a new space station crew member - Clay A=
nderson - and bring Sunita Williams back to Earth after six months in space.

A detailed mission preview will be posted early next week. In the meantime,=
 an updated launch windows chart has been posted on the CBS News STS-117 Qu=
ick-Look page

http://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/currentglance.html
