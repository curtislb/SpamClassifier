<strong>Ahead on CNN</strong>

Raw Politics Tonight: Immigration deal under siege, McCain pumps up fundraising

Supporters of the immigration deal may need to build a border fence around their offices -- their bill is under siege, even drawing an off-color, private comment from a ranking Republican, CNN's Tom Foreman reports in tonight's "Raw Politics."

Also, John McCain had a bad start in fund raising for his presidential bid, but now he's in the midst of a grueling schedule of money-raising events.

And a one hundred percent failure: the federal government has launched its annual seat belt awareness campaign and President Bush didn't seem to get the memo.

Catch "Raw Politics" tonight on Anderson Cooper 360, 10 p.m. ET.
