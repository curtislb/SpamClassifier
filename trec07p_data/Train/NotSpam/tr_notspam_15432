Lou Dobbs Tonight
Friday, June 1, 2007

Tonight, President Bush is out defending the Senate’s so-called
grand compromise that would grant amnesty to millions of
illegal aliens in America. President Bush suggests the illegal
immigration debate is about whether or not you appreciate the
presence of Latinos in this country. We’ll report tonight on
why President Bush is playing the race card.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is already facing a
massive backlog in processing the applications of people
seeking U.S. citizenship. So how will the already overwhelmed
agency process the applications of millions of illegal aliens
who could be awarded citizenship if the Senate’s so called
grand compromise is passed? Find out tonight.

Senator and presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, gave a
speech in Silicon Valley Thursday under the banner “New Jobs
for Tomorrow.” Only Clitnon wasn’t speaking out in support of
jobs for American workers: Speaking before more than 200
high-tech company executives, Senator Clinton spoke out in
support of bringing in more H1-B visa workers from countries
like India and China to work in the United States. How are
American workers reacting to the Senator’s comments?

In our tribute to the men and women who serve this country in
uniform, we’ll bring you the story of Army Sgt. Micheaux
Sanders. The Army Sgt. was wounded in a battle with insurgents
but continued to fight, and for that, he was awarded the Silver
Star for bravery.

And we'll be joined by three of the country's best political
analysts for a full round-up and discussion of the week that
was: Former White House Political Director Ed Rollins,
Democratic National Committeeman Robert Zimmerman and Pulitzer
Prize-winning columnist for the New York Daily News, Michael
Goodwin, join Lou tonight.

Visit http://cnn.com/loudobbstonight to read Lou’s
latest commentary on how the left wing and the right wing of
this nation’s media are hell-bent on attacking him personally,
and why he won’t back down.

Lou Dobbs lays out his manifesto to save the middle class in
his new book, “War on the Middle Class: How the Government, Big
Business, and Special Interest Groups Are Waging War on the
American Dream and How to Fight Back.” War on the Middle Class
is now on sale in bookstores near you and on Amazon.com and
BarnesandNoble.com.
