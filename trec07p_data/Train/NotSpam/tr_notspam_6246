I don't see what that would add. Why should we set up a domain member if
we just one need a dc to run against?

If we'd have one such "sane default", then there is no point in having
multiple environments at all.

In that case, why not add an ENV= variable so you can run "make testenv
ENV=member" ? Or perhaps we can simply add "make testenv-dc" and "make
testenv-member"?

We can print out the environment name for failed tests, if that would help.

That will make other things more complex. For example, we'd need to
change the environment variables to be $DC1_IP, $DC1_USERNAME,
$DC2_PASSWORD, etc because the tests can be run against either of the
dcs or domain member.

It also makes things like "make test TESTS=SAMR" slower as the
provisioning is two or three times as slow.

It's not just the time it takes to set up the environment, also the fact
that it makes it harder to support other targets (because of the
complexity of the environment they need to support) and the inability to
mix environments.

Cheers,
