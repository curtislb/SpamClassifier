Lou Dobbs Tonight
Thursday, May 24, 2007

Tonight, President Bush under fire on multiple fronts,
including his plan for victory and funding for the Iraq war and
the so-called comprehensive immigration reform compromise. And
Democrats are voting for the critical Iraq war funding bill, an
issue that has fractured the Democratic Party. We’ll have the
latest from Capitol Hill tonight.

>From the left and the right, a dangerous consensus is emerging
that this Senate immigration compromise is “good enough” and
needs to be passed despite its flaws. But as we report tonight,
history has proven that passing flawed legislation does nothing
to restore law to the immigration process. Instead, it
guarantees loopholes and incentives for the next wave of
illegal immigration. We’ll have that report tonight.

We’ll also take a look at other countries in the world that are
dealing with a massive influx of immigration into their labor
forces. We’ll compare and contrast the immigration policies in
Canada, France and Australia with those of the United States in
terms of admitting family members, qualifications for entry and
quotas.

Arizona Republicans are outraged by the support of their
elected officials for amnesty. Dozens of Republicans protested
outside Sen. John Kyl’s office this week, and some have
officially left the party. A leading state lawmaker is calling
for the resignation of Sen. John McCain, who has missed nearly
half of the Senate’s votes while campaigning for President.
We’ll bring you that story tonight.

And union leaders are outraged over the Senate’s amnesty
legislation. Critics say the bill will increase the numbers of
H1-B visas granted to high tech workers from overseas to the
extent that there will be no incentives for college students to
pursue degrees in the math and sciences. How soon will it be
until U.S. colleges and universities graduate very few people
with degrees in engineering?

Sen. Jim Bunning is a leading opponent of the Senate's amnesty
legislation. Sen. Bunning says the bill will reward lawbreakers
with a get out of jail free pass, and he joins Lou tonight for
a frank discussion of the issues.

And Senator Ben Nelson says millions more illegal aliens will
come to the United States unless the Senate's amnesty bill
tackles border security first. The Senator joins us as well.

latest commentary on why we’ve failed to learn our history
lesson	when it comes to immigration laws.
