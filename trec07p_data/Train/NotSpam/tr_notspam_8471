I added the patch via (http://krbdev.mit.edu/rt/, Bug ID is: #5555. I 
assigned that bug to you (hope you don't mind).

It modifies an internal, private structure (the krb5_gic_opt_private in 
krb5-1.6.1/src/include/k5-int.h) and adds two new calls to libkrb5 
(incl. header). So, I think it does not.

Hm, I've never seen personal copyright in MIT code, that is why I just 
used the "default" copyright header. If you do add personal copyright in 
an appropriate location, you can of course add my name there. If not, 
that's fine as well.

Thanks,
Guenther
