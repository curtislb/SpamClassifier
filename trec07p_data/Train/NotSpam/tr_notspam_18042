Assertions like this really ought to be broken up in the source. By
using multiple assertions, it's immediately obvious which assertion as
actually failing. I've been meaning to split this up for quite some
time but never got around to it.

Good work! This has been the cause of a number of Perl 6 GC errors. I
spent some time trying to track it down before but never made it as
far as you did.

Here's hoping that this is the last GC bug. ;-)
