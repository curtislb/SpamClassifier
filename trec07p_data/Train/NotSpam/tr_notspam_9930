As discussed at SambaXP, we'd like to get the ball for TP5 rolling and
release it in the next few weeks.

The build farm state is reasonable at the moment; hopefully we can fix 
the couple of tests that are broken in the next few days.

I hope this TP can enter Debian experimental. At the moment, tdb and ldb 
are already in sid. talloc was initially refused (because of some 
licensing issues), but should enter sid soon.

Metze mentioned there is a bug in the DCE/RPC code when marking the 
connection dead that should be fixed before TP 5. Are there any other 
issues people think should be fixed for TP 5?

Cheers,

Jelmer
