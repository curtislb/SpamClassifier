Why .filename.xmp ? It should be basename.xmp (no dot prepended)
I don't know where this convention comes from but definitely not the one
from the current (non-free) implementations.
I'd rather wish we don't reinvent the wheel.

xmp_init() cost a lot to call. Same as xmp_terminate(). You should only
call then once. Actually xmp_terminate() isn't mandatory as when the
programm quits, things will be cleaned up.

And the CC namespace of XMP is defined in the library. It is NS_CC. This
is cosmetic, but ensure that we use the right string.
