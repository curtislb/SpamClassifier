What do you need a serial port for? I have a networking degree focusing on
Cisco devices and if there isn't a serial port you simply access it by USB
via a USB to serial adapter. Serial ports have been becoming more and more
extinct.

the solution to that is usb->serial converters.  I'm going to school for IT,
and hope to get a job in networking at some point soon, so made sure the
laptop I got had a serial port.  While this wasn't the only deciding factor,
it was pretty high on the list.  I was willing to sacrafice some of the 8 or
16 serial ports on certain laptops (why would someone want that many USB on
a laptop anyway)? for a serial port.
