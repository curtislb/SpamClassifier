I don't think so.  Consider:

    #(
    #	1,
    #	2,
    #	3,
    #).sort.say

Translating that to $_.sort.say is going to elicit Great Astonishment.

And by and large, line-endiness doesn't matter for #} because people
generally put } on a line by itself anyway.  And when the #} is
*unexpected* it almost certainly means they meant it as a line-end
comment:

    #for @foo {
    #	.say
    #}; exit();

Finally, if the user really wants to terminate a comment after }, all they
have to do is just make sure the opening #{ isn't first thing on a line.
And then it's even symmetrical in a sense, going from mid-line to mid-line.
