    Thanks.  Still getting used to BSD's way of doing things.  I used 
group access for specific task types I want restricted, like access to 
the mailx command, which makes a wondermous spammers tool.  Also changed 
the names of commands like attrib and used it to lock down programs, 
keeping root kits guessing and less effective.  What I really would've 
liked to do is set up the security protocols to require that executables 
also have attrib's indestructible bit set in order to run, and then 
re-write attrib so that it could only be run from the local keyboard. 
It could be used to set up a virus/worm proof system if they can't 
upload and run anything without root permission.  Just don't break 
attrib or you'll have to reset the security protocols. from a bootup disk.

         Michael
