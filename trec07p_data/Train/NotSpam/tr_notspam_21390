You might also want to give virtualbox a try under windows.

This is the open source and free software Qemu.  It is quite fast, and is able to emulate several types of CPU as well as different types of sound card, network card, etc.  Running under Windows I can create .bat files, and run different systems from each.  I'm currently trying to get LFS working--I know, it's a lot of waiting and compiling, but I've got time.  If anybody's interested, the Qemu home page is:

Some people have told me they don't think a fat penguin really embodies the 
grace of Linux, which just tells me they have never seen a angry penguin 
charging at them in excess of 100mph.  They'd be a lot more careful about what 
they say if they had.
