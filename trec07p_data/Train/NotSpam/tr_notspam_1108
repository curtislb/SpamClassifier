On the other hand, we've managed very well in Perl 5 with the flag data in
embed.fnc and generating the annotated headers programmatically.

I think it would have been nice to have had something like this some years
ago (er, maybe 10) to prevent the magpies from turning any and every function
in the Perl 5 core into part of the supported API.

Particularly given that on some platforms (such as Win32) API functions need
to be exported explicitly, resulting in modules written on *nix platforms
not working on Win32. 

(and actually, I'm tempted to add it even now to Perl 5 to enforce what
remains of our sanity)
