Maiki,

 

I am glad you like the concept  I think it is difficult
for people to wrap their heads around, but once you do
there are a lot of advantages.Let me answer your points
one at a time.

 

Distributing online digital media is nearly costless:

If licensed under Creative Commons these files can be
downloaded, e-mailed, shared, and reproduced.  Consumers
will do these actions themselves providing a network of
distribution that is costless to them, but has greater
range, speed, convenience, and intelligence than
distribution through cds on store shelves.

 

Backups would be unnecessary:  

If you lose your copy simply download another copy from
our site or from someone else.

 

CDs providing value to fans:

CDs compared to online downloads have little value.  The
artwork and other materials that have traditionally been
packaged with CDs are media in themselves and can be
created through other proposals or included in a single
proposal along with the music.  If someone would like to
burn the music to CD, print the album art and other
supplements, and put the together, they are free to do so.

 

 

Yours,

Brandt Cannici
