TGIF All!

I hope my thread is relevant and not off-topic here. If it is, please
ignore it and I apologize for taking up your time.

I'm currently looking to implement a web function and an OS/X widget
utilizing JavaScript's XmlHttpRequest (aka asynchronous javascript, aka
AJAX). I thought at first it might make more sense to write the backend
part of my script in PHP, but PHP lacks
http://search.cpan.org/dist/File-Tail/Tail.pm which I'd like to use for
continuous screening of a spool file.

I was hoping someone could point me in the correct direction to have
Perl properly speak with XmlHttpRequest. My main objective is to use
AJAX functionality to speak to Perl on the backend, find me updates to
the spool/log file, and push that information back to the JavaScript
object which processes it and puts it into the browser.

Is what I'm looking for feasible? Make sense?

Thank you all, and enjoy your weekend!
