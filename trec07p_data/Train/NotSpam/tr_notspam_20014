Hello,
    While I realize that there may very well be some bennefit to compiling 
the Speakup system as a module, I use it directly in kernel because it 
doesn't cause trouble and because I know I'm likely the only person who will 
ever use the machine, and I'll always want Speakup.  Granted, I have a 
Dectalk Express, but still...
Thanks,
Zack.
