One of the problematic aspects of the patent system is the extensive
litigation it creates. Patentees litigate because of their desire to ensure
a differentiated product, and because patent boundaries are often uncertain.
In pharmaceutical markets, innovators use patents strategically, often
trying to extend their period of monopoly through increasingly weak patents.
This inevitably leads to litigation, which has tremendous, wasteful costs.

Much litigation could be avoided through the use of a prize system, such as
that proposed in HR417, since the incentive to invent around would be less.
Similarly, there would be no benefit from trying to extend the period during
which rewards would be granted through the use of weak patents which
confered no actual benefit to consumers. This suggests that a reduction in
litigation could be an important potential benefit from a prize system.

James Bessen and Michael Meurer have a recent working paper examining the
cost of patent litigation, available at
http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=983736
. They conclude, strikingly:

"Using a large set of event studies, we estimate the total cost that patent
litigation imposes on firms and we estimate the risk of infringement
litigation. We find that, contrary to what is sometimes assumed, the
business costs of litigation far exceed the direct legal costs. And we find
that by the late 1990s, patent litigation risk was of the same order as, if
not larger than, estimates of the private benefits firms receive from
patents. Moreover, consistent with the previous literature, the losses to
alleged infringers do not correspond to a transfer of wealth to patent
holders; instead there is a substantial joint loss of wealth. Our estimates
concern private costs rather than the social costs of litigation,
nevertheless these estimates tell us something about the effectiveness of
patents as a policy tool to encourage investment in innovation.

In the best case, this suggests that the patent system is at present an
inefficient form of subsidy or regulation. Thomas Hopkins estimates the
total 1992 cost of general regulatory compliance is $389,911 per firm (in
1995 dollars). But the costs of complying with the patent system—annual
infringement risk of $4.5 million—are much larger.

In the worst case, the net effect of patents today may be to reduce the
profits of public firms and to possibly impose disincentives on innovative
activity as well. Exploration of the possible causes and the significance of
this for policy and for normative analysis are beyond the scope of this
paper, however."
