Well you could run grml under vmware, or maybe ubuntu and play with orca.
The usb to serial converts still apply with speakup in or out of vmware.
I am jus lucky enough myself when I built my machine it had one comport on it.
I really actually don't use speakup much anymore sinse we have gnome, and yasr if I need it.
