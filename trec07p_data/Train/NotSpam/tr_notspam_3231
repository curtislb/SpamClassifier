There's two cases for mapping from SIDs to UGIDs.

First case is where full SIDs are explicitly stored in the directory  
or have a static partitioning (like Unix Users and Unix Groups). In  
this case, you don't need to be told what kind of ID the caller is  
looking for, because the SID is globally unique, and must only map to  
one ID.

Second case is where the SID is dynamically generated from other  
information in the directory. In this case, knowing the type of ID in  
advance helps a lot and can prevent you generating bogus SIDs.

I take it that it is this second case that is problematic?

I don't see any winbind client calls in idmap_tdb.c. Could you spell  
this out a bit more?

So existing idmap modules will need to be changed?
