I'm not sure if I would charcterize my analysis as including major 
objections, but rather some concerns.
I explicitly stated that I did n ot actually find DFSG problems, although 
two complicated portions were not analyized.
So I would say I had concerns but not nessisrally objections.

Nevertheless, I would also say that my post is hardly consensus. So while no 
major objections
may have been raised on list, it is also true that there is no real consenus 
that  the licence in its current draft
from does meet the DFSG.  Impling that it does to the FSF is not a great 
idea.

IANAL, IANADD
