The only place InactiveDestroy is appropriate is just after a fork in
either the parent or the child (depending on which one is keeping the
handle).  You should immediately disconnect the database handle after
setting the flag (either explicitly with disconnect or implicitly by
opening another and assigning it to the same scalar).  In the case of
the code in question it looks like this

                my $pid = fork();
                if ($pid == 0 && defined($pid)){
                        # child connection
                        # do lots of stuff in here, including make our
own db connection
                        $dbh->{InactiveDestroy} = 1;
                        $dbh = DBI->connect($dsn, $dbun, $dbpw,
{RaiseError => 1});
                        # do stuff
                        exit;
                } elsif ($pid) {
                        # this is the parent - do nothing
                } else {
                        warn "unable to fork: resources unavailable.\n";
                }
