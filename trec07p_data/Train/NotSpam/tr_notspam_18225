						<b>A Newsnight exclusive tonight:</b>
<br>

<br>
We have an incredible interview with the former wife of a British Muslim ex=
tremist. She tells us how her husband tried to persuade her to carry out a =
suicide attack in the UK. She explains in detail how her husband showed her=
 how to wear an explosive belt. We'll be discussing how such extremism can =
be tackled.
<br>

<br>
<B>Iraq Inquiry</b>
<br>

<br>
The Conservatives are calling for a full inquiry into the war in Iraq. Gord=
on Brown, visiting Baghdad today, said it would be wrong to hold an inquiry=
 now while British troops are still serving in Iraq. We'll be debating the =
issue.=20
<br>

<br>
<b>Iranian Influence in Afghanistan</b>
<br>

<br>
A high tech "shaped" bomb has been found in Kabul today. These are similar =
to the ones used in Iraq against Allied vehicles, and the military say coul=
d come from Iran. Alastair Leithead reports from Afghanistan on the extent =
of Iran's influence in the country.
<br>

<br>
<b>Dog Eat Dog World </b>
<br>

<br>
How many dogs should you be allowed to walk on the pavement at one time? Ke=
nsington and Chelsea have issued a by-law saying no more than two. That's j=
ust barking mad say some residents. We visit some of the richest streets in=
 the country and meet Tory activists who are furious at the dogmatic approa=
ch taken by their Conservative council.
<br>

<br>
Do join Jeremy at 10:30 tonight.
