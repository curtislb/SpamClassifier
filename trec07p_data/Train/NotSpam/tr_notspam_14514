  MS had such extreme input into WSIS process, via specific country
representatives, for the same reason why CRIA's Graham Henderson has the
ear of the Heritage Minister(s) (Conservative or Liberal) and Heritage
Committee.  Henderson is able to set up meetings trivially.  These
politicians actually trust these special interests as being a source of
useful information.  They mistakenly believe these special interests are
somehow the public interest.

  It is our job to try to help educate politicians as to the difference
between these special interests and the public interest, especially when
the two are in such extreme conflict.

IE: I really wonder why providers of historically expensive equipment
for recording, editing and distributing/broadcasting content are still
offered copyright at all now that these technologies are cheap enough to
be in the hands of everyone.   The sections of the Canadian copyright
act that grant rights to "makers" of recordings and broadcasters should
be repealed.


  See the latest in the USA where the redundant recording labels now
want the regime that makes radio work (compulsory licensing for
composers, no royalty for makers or performers) repealed so that they
(the redundant "makers" of recordings) can take the lions share of the
money away from composers and performers (the only parties that should
have copyright at all).  The falsely claim is that this is about getting
money for performers, when it is really about "makers" taking it away
from songwriters, and there are uninformed politicians that believe them.
