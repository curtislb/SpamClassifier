Lou Dobbs Tonight
Monday June 4, 2007

Tonight, top military commanders in Iraq on the progress of the
war in Iraq say only one quarter of Baghdad is in a “controlled
state.” We’ll have full coverage.

The National Association of Former Border Patrol Officers are
holding a presser today against the Senate's so called grand
immigration compromise. They say the bill was "rushed onto the
express train for passage... with little transparency for the
American citizen and no input from experts." We'll have a
special report on their reaction to the Senate’s illegal alien
amnesty legislation.

Nearly 100 amendments are included in the grand compromise that
would grant amnesty to the millions of illegal aliens living in
the United States. Join us tonight for a full examination of
the bill. We’ll be discussing what those amendments mean for
its success, or failure.

Big Business is gearing up to weaken tough employer sanctions
included in the Senate’s proposed amnesty legislation. Business
groups argue that a provision built into the bill requiring
employers to prove the legal status of the people they are
employing is too burdensome. We’ll have a full report.

We'll discuss the growing debate over politics and religion in
this country. Tony Perkins, President of the Family Research
Council and Rev. Barry Lynn, Executive Director at Americans
United for the Separation of Church and State join Lou tonight.

latest commentary as he offers a response to the vigorous

Lou Dobbs lays out his manifesto to save the middle class in

Business, and Special Interest Groups Are Waging War on the
American Dream and How to Fight Back.” War on the Middle Class
is now on sale in bookstores near you and on Amazon.com and
