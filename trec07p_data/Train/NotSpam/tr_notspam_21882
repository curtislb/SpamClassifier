Opere d'arte rubate ritrovate in un casolare
21/06/2007, ore 20:48

Fermo | La scoperta a cura del Commissariato di Fermo; opere trafugate da un
antiquario di Porto San Giorgio sono state rinvenute in un casolare a San
Marco alle Paludi, nei guai un pugliese di 31 anni indagato per ricettazione

Eccellente operazione portata a termine dal Commissariato di Polizia di
Fermo, che dopo un accurato lavoro d'indagine hanno portato a termine il
recupero di numerosi oggetti d'arte sottratti ad un negozio antiquario di
Porto San Giorgio lo scorso marzo.

Gli oggetti, statue, cornici, arazzi, una cassapanza, alcuni scrittoi ed un
pianoforte, per un valore complessivo che si aggir? sui 70.000 euro, sono
stati ritrovati in campagna, a poca distanza dalla Chiesa di San Marco alle
Paludi, in un casolare.

Gli inquirenti sono riusciti a risalire alla merce rubata dopo aver scoperto
alcune foto degli oggetti d'arte rubati nel corso di una perquisizione nei
confronti di un pugliese di 31 anni, ora indagato per ricettazione, e
possibile anello di congiunzione tra i ladri e gli acquirenti delle opere.

Ma non si esclude che possa essere lui stesso il ladro degli oggetti al
negozio di antiquariato, con l'aiuto di altri complici.

Ora si continua ad indagare per tentare di trovare la quadratura del
cerchio. Nel frattempo, un risultato importante, che restituisce oggetti di
valore al proprietario.

Moderator comment.

Within a museum building RFID rarely does what it promises. The track-and trace option only works if a LOT of receivers are installed in the museum or if every doorframe is supplied with an antenna. In all museums that I know of RFID is only used for motion detection and not for track and trace. In none of these museums RFID is used to 'reveal the exact position' of paintings, or any other objects. If Julian Bickersteth intends to follow the overseas trend he will be discover that RFID is just used as an 'old fashioned' motion detector.
The "cheapest radio identifiers are still 60 or 70 cents" he is referring to are passive tags and can only be traced when they pass very near by a reader or antenna (like in library books). Active tags that send their signal over an much longer distance are not only much bigger because of the battery that is inside, but also are much more expensive (c. ? 45,00 each). These tags may be easier to trace over a longer distance, but also are very visible for a thief and therefore most of the time easy to remove.

THE would-be art thief thinks he's cracked it. The gallery's security guard is patrolling elsewhere, perhaps investigating a disturbance staged as a distraction. The thief begins to unscrew the old master, planning to slip it into a bag or under his coat before melting into the weekend crowds. He knows the gallery's front door has no security scanner.

But security staff are already onto him. Motion detectors installed in the painting will detect the slightest movement. And even if they fail, a radio frequency identifier (RFID) attached to the back of the frame will help track a painting that has been removed from the wall. A signal sent every 15 seconds reveals the painting's exact position. Before he knows it, the thief is confronted, the painting saved and a gallery's reputation remains intact.

As we know, the Art Gallery of NSW had no such high-tech security when the diminutive A Cavalier (Self-Portrait), by the 17th-century Dutch artist Frans van Mieris, was stolen the Sunday before last. There wasn't even a security camera in the small room where it hung. Before long, however, such technology will not only improve gallery and museum security, it will transform the experience of visitors.

Julian Bickersteth, the managing director of International Conservation Services, a Sydney museum consultancy, says Australian cultural institutions will inevitably follow the overseas trend.

"Take-up in Australia has been slow because it is not a cheap system to put in place," he says, noting that a bar code for a painting, for example, costs about five cents whereas the cheapest radio identifiers are still 60 or 70 cents. "Like all these electronic things, it needs a lot of effort. And it then has to be tied into your overall security system.

"Essentially you'll have a system that is electronically checking the location of every painting in the gallery every 15 seconds, a far cry from the traditional system of guards wandering around to check they're all there.

"The sad thing about the [Art Gallery of NSW] theft is that it's not been a problem in Australia - it's been much more one in Europe and the US. But it means that here we'll have to start looking more at security," he says.

These advances in security technology are also transforming the gallery experience, particularly in the US. Information stored on the identifier mounted on a picture can be accessed by hand-held devices, such as PDAs, that are lent to visitors when they enter the gallery. The data can range from basic catalogue information to a video interview with the artist, and even interactive games for school-aged visitors.
"If you're standing in front of Jackson Pollock's Blue Poles at the National Gallery, for instance, you can have video streaming from the RFID to your PDA showing him making the work and slapping paint all over the place," Bickersteth says. "Clearly there's a whole new level of visitor experience which we are going to be quickly encountering."

Traditionalists might splutter at the thought of such high-tech add-ons and ask what's wrong with just standing in front of a painting and looking at it. It is a question Bickersteth has considered. "The interesting issue, of course, is when are you starting to detract from the visual experience? An awful lot of people would go and stand in front of Blue Poles and just soak it up and not be distracted by all these other things.

"I think the answer is that we're moving into a new generation, and it's certainly the case with my children, where they say they want more. We have the ability to provide the gen Ys with a lot more contextual information at the touch of a button, and I think it's great, actually.

"You don't have to do it - you can just stand there and look at it - but at the same time you can find out the context. How did he paint this work? Where does it fit in? You get all those different levels."

Changes are already happening in Australia, with online collections, podcasts and other digital resources, and Bickersteth says the evolution of web-based communities and hosted services has significant implications for cultural institutions.

"No longer is content king; now the user is king," he says. "That's the paradigm that we in the museum world are coming to, that people are choosing what they want to look at and what information they want rather than just being fed the information we think they should have. We can't do anything to stop that.

"At some level, I think it's quite exciting. There's a big movement at the moment to what's called co-creation, whereby it is not just the curators who have the knowledge, it's the ability of the public to also feed them knowledge."

He cites the example of the Australian War Memorial's photographic collection, which is available online. "They encourage you to go and look at that, and if you see Uncle Fred standing on the wing of a Lancaster bomber in 1944, please tell us. They then feed that information back into the collection."

With fine art, however, things get murkier. "Do we really want to know what Miranda from Bondi thinks about Edmund Capon's latest acquisition? Do we want an amateur providing her views on things? But then that's when blogs are useful."

The biggest hurdle in Australia is its relatively slow broadband speed, especially when compared with the US. "We've been slow in getting our cultural content onto the web, so until we've got better web content I don't think we'll see better take-up of technology in terms of contextual information provision in museums and galleries," Bickersteth says.

Five men carry out art burglary 

Several oil paintings have been stolen from a house in Godstone, Surrey, by
five balaclava-clad men. 
One of the works on canvas, called Shooting Party, by George White, is
valued at about ?15,800, police said. 

And another painting, Portrait of Lydia Harvey, by John Heins Senior, is
thought to be worth about ?14,000. 

In an appeal for information on Thursday, officers said the break-in, at a
property in Leigh Place Lane, happened between 30 and 31 May.

Guilty plea in Dr. Seuss thefts
BY KIMBALL PERRY | KPERRY@ENQUIRER.COM
It's off to the slam, I am, because I'm in a jam, I am.

That's what John Hunnicutt is trying to avoid.

Hunnicutt pleaded guilty to the theft of more than $50,000 in autographed
Dr. Seuss lithographs and jade figurines stolen from Kathleen Lester's
Symmes Township home.

Now he's cooperating with police, hoping to lessen his prison sentence.

That led to the Tuesday arrest and Wednesday court appearance of Sean
Kammerer.

Hunnicutt, 41, pleaded guilty June 14 to burglarizing Lester's home and
receiving stolen property, a plea deal that is expected to result in a
two-year prison term when he is sentenced next week.

Hunnicutt, though, is cooperating with police to recover the stolen items,
hoping that shortens his sentence.

Hunnicutt told police Kammerer helped him steal the art.

Kammerer, 41, of West Chester, was arrested Tuesday and charged with
complicity to burglary, accused of providing Hunnicutt with a ride to and
from the home.

Police said Hunnicutt did some handyman work at Lester's home and later
returned - after getting a ride from Kammerer - to steal the lithographs and
jade figurines.

The lithographs were of original pages of some Seuss books and were
autographed by the author, Theodor Seuss Geisel.

Kammerer's father, Robert F. Kammerer, who operates the Springdale Coin and
Antique Shop, said he bought the lithographs from Hunnicutt.

"He had some pictures he wanted to sell," Robert Kammerer said Wednesday of
Hunnicutt.

"We bought them not knowing they were stolen. It was a good buy."

Robert Kammerer said he did not pay "more than $1,000" for the lithographs.

Robert Kammerer said he and his son didn't find out until Tuesday the
lithographs were stolen.

They found out, Robert Kammerer said, when police pulled over the van his
son was driving and found some of the lithographs inside. They arrested Sean
Kammerer.

That arrest came less than a week after Hunnicutt pleaded guilty before
Hamilton County Common Pleas Court Judge Robert Ruehlman.

Sean Kammerer's attorney said in court Wednesday he has "mental issues" and
is easily manipulated.

"I think he was used in this case," said his attorney, Anna Schmalz.

Neither police nor Lester returned calls Wednesday.

Cannington museum hit by thieves
Date: 2007-06-21 
Author: Scott Howard

'I guess that even if it's nailed down, someone will find a way to steal
it.' 
Ted Foster can only shake his head.
"I guess that even if it's nailed down, someone will find a way to steal
it," said the president of the Cannington Historical Society.
The steel rails, plates and spikes were stolen from the Cannington Museum's
railroad display last Monday night (June 11).
It's the latest act in a rampant string of crime at the museum in recent
years. But this really strikes home for Mr. Foster and other members of the
historical society.
"This was not an act of vandalism. This was pre-meditated theft. The
culprits knew the site and they had the tools necessary to remove the
spikes. They also had the heavy machinery to haul it away," Mr. Foster said.
Mr. Foster estimates that it would cost $10,000 to replace the rails with
new material. But the true loss is the historical value of the rails. They
were made in 1883 and are truly irreplaceable.
"This isn't something that you can pick up at Home Depot," he said.
In past years, the caboose at the museum has been targeted by vandals, with
windows and doors being smashed and the roof and siding damaged and
destroyed.
The theft of the railway line has Mr. Foster questioning whether the
historical society should even bother continuing their efforts to preserve
the heritage of the village.
"Is there really any point in continuing to replace artifacts only to have
them vandalized or stolen?" Mr. Foster asked.
"The Historical Society is a volunteer organization funded by public
donations and fundraising. We do not have the funds or volunteer labour
necessary to continually repair and replace items that are stolen or
destroyed. We may have to consider scaling back or closing the collection at
the museum."
Anyone with information regarding the theft is asked to call the Durham
Police at 1-888-579-1520 or Crime Stoppers at 1-888-222-8477 (TIPS).

Detienen a un vecino de Olot en posesi?n de 37 obras de arte robadas
A?adir comentario

Olot. (EFE).- Los Mossos d'Esquadra han detenido a un vecino de Olot acusado
de tener en su poder 37 obras de arte robadas y de cometer un delito de
receptaci?n, mientras la polic?a contin?a investigando si el detenido es el
autor material del robo de las mismas.

PALABRAS CLAVE

Olot, Mossos, Garrotxa, Vilanova 
Los agentes identificaron a Sergio G.C., de 26 a?os y vecino de Olot, como
el individuo que dej? las obras de arte robadas envueltas en s?banas en dos
domicilios de Olot con el pretexto de estar realizando una mudanza.

Supuestamente, las personas que resid?an en estos domicilios no conoc?an el
contenido ni el origen de estos "paquetes".

El pasado d?a 9 los Mossos de la comisar?a de Olot recibieron una denuncia
de un individuo que manifestaba haber sido v?ctima de un robo en su
domicilio, en el que se estaban llevando a cabo algunos trabajos de reforma.

Concretamente explic? que le hab?an desaparecido 37 cuadros, algunos de
ellos de reconocidos pintores y de alto valor como Vallsquer, Planagum?,
Barnadas, Vilanova o Bosch Pla, algunas joyas y diversas antig?edades.

Los indicios apuntaban que el robo podr?a haber sido llevado a cabo entre el
4 y el 8 de junio, pero el propietario no ech? en falta sus pertenencias
hasta el d?a que dio aviso a la polic?a, el 9 de junio, ya que utiliza la
casa como segunda residencia.

Los Mossos concluyeron que ning?n acceso a la casa hab?a sido forzado, por
lo que sospecharon que los ladrones habr?an actuado aprovechando las
reformas que se estaban haciendo en el edificio.

Siguiendo diversos indicios, los Mossos sospecharon que las obras de arte
pod?an estar escondidas en dos domicilios particulares de la capital de la
Garrotxa y al confirmarlo contactaron con las personas que viv?an en los
lugares donde se escond?an los objetos robados y recuperaron todo el bot?n.

Despu?s de tomar declaraci?n a estas dos personas, los agentes determinaron
que posiblemente no ten?an conocimiento de lo que guardaban en casa, ya que
la persona que hab?a llevado las obras de arte, Sergio G.C, las hab?a
envuelto y les hab?a dicho que se estaba cambiando de piso y que necesitaba
dejarlas all? durante unos d?as

A pesar de esta detenci?n y la recuperaci?n de las obras, los mossos no dan
por cerrada la investigaci?n ya que todav?a queda por determinar si el
detenido habr?a sido tambi?n el autor material del robo, o bien ?ste es obra
de otra persona.

La detenci?n de Sergio G.C., que tiene antecedentes por numerosos delitos,
se dej? sin efecto a la espera que declarara ante el juez.

Kenyans fete repatriated relics 
By Odiambo Joseph 
BBC News, Chalani, Kenya  

Photos:
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6231134.stm


For the last 22 years, a village along Kenya's picturesque coast has blamed
its ill fortune on the theft of two memorial wooden statues known as
vigango. 
Earlier this week, Chalani village in Kilifi District was the scene of
joyous celebration as villagers received two vigango which had been
repatriated from the United States. 


Vigango are wooden statues which are considered sacred by Kenya's Mijikenda
ethnic group and erected on the graves of revered elders. 

Hundreds of vigango have reportedly been stolen and exported to Europe and
the US, where they are sold to private collectors hungry for ethnic African
art. 

The thefts are carried out by poor youth who are seduced by the prospect of
easy money, which they make from selling the stolen artefacts to traders
fronting for foreign buyers. 

The National Museum of Kenya has been spearheading efforts to repatriate
these vigango. 

The principal curator of the museum, Phillip Jimbi Katana, travelled to the
remote village in the coastal region to hand over the two statues. 

"We are handing over two vigango, which were stolen here in 1985 and they
found their way all the way to America," Mr Katana said. 

Small gods 

To the Mijikenda community, vigango are small gods believed to hold the
spirits of departed elders. 


The carved wooden statues depict human faces and are erected on the graves
of members of the Gohu society, a powerful tribal council. 

Vigango can be four to six feet high, and their size is determined by the
status of the Gohu member. 

The Mijikenda believe the vigango bring luck and prosperity as the dead
elders intercede with God to bring good tidings to the family and the
community. 

Kalume Mwakiru's family says it has suffered numerous tragedies in the last
two decades including sickness, bad harvests and the death of their family
patriarch. And they insist that this is because the two vigango were stolen
from family graves. 

When Mr Mwakiru's two sons died, he erected vigango on their graves. But the
carved wooden statues, decorated with triangular etchings, were stolen
shortly after. 

Mr Mwakiru died soon afterwards, and his wife Kache Kalume Mwakiru blames
his death on the theft of the vigango. 

Festus Tinga Mwakiru, the new head of the family, says the theft of the two
statues is directly responsible for the family's plight. 

"When the vigango were stolen, the family became sick and poor. I feel that
I am poor because the vigango were stolen," he says. 

Song and dance 

The two vigango which were returned to the Mwakiru family were found at the
Illinois State Museum and the Hampton University Museum in Virginia. 


 I expect to make money because the vigango are now back 
Festus Tinga Mwakiru  

Chalani village came alive with song and dance as the vigango were returned
to the Mwakiru family and installed on the desecrated graves. 

Only members of the revered Gohu Council are allowed to handle the sacred
vigango and 10 senior elders were on hand to receive the two statues and
erect them on the graves. 

The chairman of the Gohu council, 70-year-old Kisau Mwaduna, said, "This
function is very important to us because we are witnessing the return of
vigango. 

"We have heard a lot of reports from various families in this whole region
that vigango are being stolen daily, this issue has been troubling us for
many years." 

High spirits 

Mr Katana, the principal curator of the National Museums of Kenya, is a
Mijikenda and deeply values his community's beliefs and traditions. 

"We believe if somebody steals it, then that person is going to be affected.
He might even become mad," Mr Katana said during the ceremony. 

"If you steal a vigango, it is going to come back to you because the vigango
is somebody's spirit. That spirit is going to disturb you and haunt you." 

Now that the vigango are back, Festus Tinga Mwakiru's spirits are high and
he believes his family's ill fortune is about to end. 

"Now, I'm feeling alright. I expect to make money because the vigango are
now back. The vigango will bring me good luck and I feel very happy." 

The Hampton University Museum is said to still hold at least 98 other
vigango statues. 

No doubt 98 other families will see this return of these two vigango as a
sign that perhaps their ancestors' spirits will soon find their way home and
bring prosperity and good fortune with them.

Stolen sculpture valued at $14K
THE ENQUIRER 
Cincinnati police still haven't figured out who took a copper sculpture at
Spring Grove Cemetery on Spring Grove Avenue.

But they are saying today the piece of art is worth about $14,000.

The sculpture was discovered missing Thursday from the cemetery's garden
courtyard. "Copper Copse" consisted of five trees sculpted out of copper.

Four of the copper trees - each about 1? feet high and 2 feet wide - were
sawed from their concrete bases.

Police alerted scrap yard dealers to watch for the unique copper pieces.

Police believe the theft is part of a rash of recent copper thefts in the
area as prices for scrap copper have been on the rise.

?10,000 art thief fled with a parking ticket

A THIEF who took ?10,000 paintings from a Holloway art shop is still on the
run ? two years after he received a parking ticket while his getaway car was
parked outside the shop.
The audacious theft happened on a busy weekday afternoon in March 2005 as a
courier collection was due to be made at Leonard Villa framers, in
Caledonian Road.
Owner Lenny Villa believes he was the victim of a carefully planned sting,
with the thief impersonating a courier.
?I had ordered a courier van to deliver four paintings and frames to
customers in the West End,? he said. ?They were collected by a man disguised
as a courier employee. The man got away before I could get his number
plate.?
Four paintings by artist Susan MacArthur, all with white gold frames, were
stolen.
While talking to Mr Villa, the thief, who was in his 20s, received a parking
ticket for his silver Series 5 BMW, which was illegally parked on the
opposite side of Caledonian Road. 
Mr Villa said: ?I brought this to the attention of Islington Council, who
told me that fines could only be revealed to the police.
?They assured me it was being looked into but, after weeks of chasing them
up, the council told me they knew nothing about it.?
Police confirmed yesterday (Thursday) that no one had been arrested for the
theft. 
Mr Villa had taken out full insurance for the frames but when he made a
claim he was offered nothing because it was a case of theft by deception and
not a break-in.

Missing Magritte painting located 
A painting by Rene Magritte valued at ?350,000 and stolen last year from a
south London storeroom has been recovered. 
A member of the public contacted the Art & Antiques Unit of the Metropolitan
Police on Thursday to say he thought he had found the painting. 

The 1927 picture Les Reflets du Temps had been reported missing from storage
in August 2006. 

The man had checked the painting against the London Stolen Art Database. 

The picture, which features a surrealist scene of a beach, sea and hat, is
being kept by the Art & Antiques Unit while they investigate its
disappearance, and will be returned to its owner, police said. 


 RENE MAGRITTE 
Born in Lessines, Belgium in 1898 
Moves to Paris in 1927 to become leading light of the Surrealist movement 
His work often features men in bowler hats, apples and pipes 
Former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney is an avid collector  

Det Supt Vernon Rapley, head of the unit, said: "For anyone considering
buying art, antiquities or cultural property the database is an invaluable
resource to help buyers check that they aren't being sold stolen items. 

"I am really pleased that the database has enabled this Magritte to be found
so that the victim can have it returned to them." 

The Art & Antiques Unit stores details and images of some 58,000 pieces of
stolen art. 

Rene Magritte, who died in 1967, was one of the best known artists of the
20th Century, creating dream-like surreal images which have become iconic. 

Born in Belgium in 1898, Magritte became a leading members of the surrealist
art community in Paris in the 1920s.

PALABRAS CLAVE

Sothebys, Andy Warhol, Londres 
La obra, una serigraf?a en acr?lico y tinta sobre lienzo titulada '30 Maos
coloreados', de la serie Reversals, fue robada en 1981 en la capital
francesa, donde estaba expuesta, y se perdi? totalmente su pista durante
todo ese tiempo.

La pintura fue recuperada este mismo a?o gracias al Art Loss Register (ARL),
el mayor banco de datos del mundo de obras perdidas o robadas, despu?s de
que alguien la llevara a Sotheby's el pasado noviembre para su valoraci?n.

El especialista de Sotheby's encargado de tasarla vio que hab?a algunas
lagunas en su historial de procedencia y se puso en contacto con el ALR, que
logr? rastrear su origen y revolver un caso que sus aseguradores no hab?an
podido solucionar.

"Nos encanta haber contribuido a que aflorara esa obra perdida y que se
vendiera tan bien en Sotheby's", declar? a la prensa Julian Radcliffe,
fundador de ARL, que vendi? la obra en representaci?n de los aseguradores,
que eran sus nuevos propietarios.

'30 Maos coloreados' fue un encargo que hizo al pintor estadounidense el
galerista suizo Bruno Bishofberger para una exposici?n celebrada en Z?rich
en 1980.

Polic?a impide robo de busto de Juan Montalvo en Uruguay 
Grupo de j?venes hab?an logrado arrancarlo de su pedestal 

 La Polic?a de Montevideo, Uruguay, logr? esta madrugada impedir que un
grupo de j?venes se robe el busto del escritor ecuatoriano Juan Montalvo
Fiallos, en un acto delictivo que fue denunciado por los vecinos de la plaza
Ecuador.

El hecho se habr?a producido en horas de la madrugada, cuando un grupo de
j?venes, entre los 16 y 20 a?os, hab?an logrado arrancar el busto de bronce
del escritor ecuatoriano, que se halla ubicado en la zona de 'Punta Gorda',
un elegante barrio de Montevideo, uruguay, en donde est? la conocida Plaza
Ecuador. Tras la denuncia de los vecinos, de que un grupo de maleantes
estaba atacando el bien p?blico, concurrieron hasta el sitio, encontr?ndolos
con la escultura en un carro tirado por un caballo, y que se aprestaban ya a
dejar el lugar. La acci?n efectiva de los uniformados logr? capturar a este
grupo de j?venes, cinco en total, que entre 16 y 20 a?os, hab?an cometido el
delito. Al ser inquiridos por la polic?a uruguaya, los j?venes confesaron
que pensaban vender este busto para comprar pasta de coca?a, seg?n
explicaron en el parte de las investigaciones. La Polic?a, tras recuperar el
busto, procedi? a entregar a la intendencia de Montevideo, para que el mismo
sea puesto en su sitio original, en la Plaza Ecuador. El busto al parecer no
habr?a sufrido da?os mayores, y podr? ser puesto nuevamente en su pedestal
en los pr?ximos d?as.

Les tableaux vol?s ? Bouc- Bel-Air retrouv?s au Canada
Publi? le vendredi 22 juin 2007 ? 05H26

Apr?s des mois d'enqu?te minutieuse des gendarmes

  

 L'adjudant Corneille et ses hommes de la gendarmerie de Bouc-Bel-Air ont
r?ussi ? mettre la main sur 14 des 40 ex-voto d?rob?s. L'enqu?te se
poursuit.

C'est un v?ritable travail de fourmi qu'ont r?alis? les gendarmes de
Bouc-Bel-Air et de la r?gion parisienne ces derni?res semaines. En effet,
apr?s la disparition d'une quarantaine d'ex-voto de grande valeur ?
Bouc-Bel-Air, les enqu?teurs ne disposaient d'aucune piste pour r?soudre
l'affaire.

Ces tableaux qui dataient du XVIIe si?cle, offerts en remerciement d'un voeu
exauc?, ?taient tous entrepos?s dans la tour du ch?teau, situ? dans le
centre du village. En octobre 2006, on avait d?couvert leur disparition. Pas
d'indice ni de trace, aucune piste. Impossible de savoir pr?cis?ment quand
ces oeuvres avaient ?t? d?rob?s. Et surtout, par qui. Un minutieux travail
de b?n?dictin avait alors ?t? op?r? pour r?pertorier un ? un tous les
tableaux vol?s. Pr?judice estim?: 56000 euros. 

C'est en avril dernier que tout s'acc?l?re: un gendarme du Service technique
de renseignement judiciaire et de documentation, o? sont centralis?s les
fichiers en r?gion parisienne, rep?re sur internet l'un des tableaux vol?s ?
Bouc. L'oeuvre figure sur un c?l?bre site d'ench?res par internet. Il fait
aussit?t plusieurs recherches pour retrouver des personnes susceptibles de
fournir des renseignements sur les tableaux. Et c'est une collectionneuse
qu?b?coise qui fait ?voluer l'enqu?te: elle a d?j? fait l'acquisition de
trois d'entre eux.

"Cette personne ?tait de bonne foi, persuad?e que les oeuvres qu'elles
avaient achet?es provenaient d'un r?seau licite", explique une source proche
de l'enqu?te. Les militaires parviennent rapidement, gr?ce ? la
collaboration de cette collectionneuse, ? retrouver la trace d'un individu
originaire du Vaucluse, qui ?volue dans le milieu artistique. A son
domicile, les gendarmes retrouvent quatorze ex-voto. 

L'homme dit les avoir achet?s chez un interm?diaire avant de commencer ? les
restaurer pour les revendre ensuite 3000 euros la pi?ce. La majorit? des
tableaux vol?s se trouvaient en effet en assez mauvais ?tat, jamais r?nov?s
depuis leur ?poque d'origine. L'homme originaire du Vaucluse aurait
rembours? la collectionneuse qu?b?coise. L'enqu?te men?e par la brigade de
gendarmerie de Bouc-Bel-Air se poursuit pour retrouver les 26 autres ex-voto
d?rob?s dans le ch?teau de Bouc, ainsi que les malfaiteurs qui les avaient
vol?s.
