Yes.

If it's important to determine how much of your slowdown is due to a
poor algorithm, how much due to a poor implementation, and how much
due a poorly-designed JVM, you could spend a few weeks coding and
benchmarking and testing, of course.

Or you could spend an hour or two trying to convince your manager that
it's sufficient to have a fast Perl program on the job today, because
you have a slow Java program on standby in case we all forget Perl
tomorrow.

Why do you ask this question in a Perl forum? Yes, Perl is great at
string manipulation; but you have your Perl program, you're happy with
it, it's your Java code that you're wondering about improving. If you
ask the Java people, they can give you better answers about improving
your Java code. And they're especially eager when they hear that Java
needs help to compete against Perl.

Cheers!
