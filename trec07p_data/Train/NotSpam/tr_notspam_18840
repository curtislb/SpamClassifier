Pat:

I have done PCA to extract eigenvectors on return series for equities.

Rotation does help and does make factors more understandable,
have had success doing this.

You are right, when doing pure statistical factors, one tends to find first factor
which explains most of the variance is the Market Beta.

Our scree score showed 20 factors explains most of the variance in equity returns.

If you sort on the factor loadings, the other first few factors tend to things such as 
interest rates,Energy prices, currency exposure. After that it gets a little more
complicated what the factors are but they tend to be sector specific. 

That's the major complaint about pure statistical factor analysis...
Interpretation but can get reasonable idea by sorting factor cores.

As for missing values, a lot of work has been done there with sampling
such as EM and Maximum Likehood.

I will check out your R code. Hopefully it will get included
Eventually in the Portfolio package.

Being new to R, will need to figure out how to "source" the code to R!

Regards,
Neil

Neil,

'factor.model.stat' is a part of POP, which is an R package (that runs under S-PLUS as well).

We've made 'factor.model.stat' public domain so you don't have to have POP in order to use it.  The version of 'factor.model.stat' in the Public Domain area is not in a package.
You can just 'source' the code.  I just checked and 'factor.model.stat' is not in the 'portfolio' package -- I'm not sure why they haven't included it.

The statistical factors are already orthogonal.  Rotation is only aimed at trying to make them more interpretable.  I'm not very optimistic about that, other than the first factor represents the market.  But if you do have success, I'd be interested in hearing of it.

A caveat to the paragraph above is that orthogonality assumes no missing values.  Having no missing values is not a very common occurrence though (at least for a lot of us).  Most of the code in 'factor.model.stat' is handling missing values.

I haven't had call for rotations, but I'd be extremely surprised if there weren't a bunch somewhere in R.  The 'RSiteSearch' function should be your friend for this.

Pat
