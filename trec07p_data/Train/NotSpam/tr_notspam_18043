Fixed in r18911.

I'm not sure it is a GC bug.  At least, if it's a GC bug, it's in assuming 
that GC flags have any meaning outside of a GC run.  I have a very strong 
inclination to revert the "Mark all STRINGs as live" change and fix all code 
that looks at GC flags outside of src/gc/*.c.

I do hope that Perl 6 runs better on Win32 with the temporary fix though.
