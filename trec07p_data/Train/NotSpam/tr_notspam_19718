Check what search() gives you.  Make sure package:grDevices is on that
list.

I ran into that problem myself.  I never figured out how come it used
to be there, but suddenly ceased to be.  The problem didn't appear
until R-2.5.0.  In the USER-VISIBLE CHANGES under 
CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.0.0,
I see this:

    o	Package 'graphics' has been split into 'grDevices' (the graphics
	devices shared between base and grid graphics) and 'graphics'
	(base graphics).  Each of the 'graphics' and 'grid' packages
	load 'grDevices' when they are attached.  Note that
	ps.options() has been moved to grDevices and user hooks may
	need to be updated.

My suspicion is that grDevices did not have to be specifically loaded
if graphics was one of your default packages loaded at startup.  Since
few others seem to have had the same experience, I'd hesitate to call
it a bug.  I've got round the problem by adding grDevices to the list
in my ~/.Rprofile file.

Others might have a better explanation, of course.
