Please, always

  use strict;
  use warnings;

at the start of your programs. That will find a lot of simple problems.

You're testing whether your file handle $output is opened to a read-permitted
file. First of all you opened it write-only so you won't be able to read from
the handle even if you have read permissions. Secondly you've closed the handle,
so it's not referring to a file at all any more.

Just open the file for read, checking any errors you get. If you don't
have read permission then the open will fail:

  open my $in, 'test.xml' or die "ERROR:  can't read XML file: $!";

  while (<$in>) {
    print;
  }

HTH,

Rob
