Great on the new Debian installer.
Not really sure why this happens, but when using the k7 based kernel and I
put some load on my machine for a while the kernel locks up and this forces
me to reboot.
I rolled my own 2.6.21 and the problems go away so not really sure what
causes this to happen.
It may be Speakup related, possibly not. Anyone else seen this problem with
the new Etch iso?

Thanks,
Tom

It's needed if you have more than 1GB memory. Else it's just a slowdown.
