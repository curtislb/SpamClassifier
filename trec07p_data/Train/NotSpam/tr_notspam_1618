The easiest way may be to put the 'use' directives in order:

  use module1;  # in current directory
  use lib 'path-to-other-directory';  # changes @INC
  use module2;  # in other directory

Then again, the easiest way may be to organize your modules properly.
Maybe you should put module2 into a directory that doesn't have any
modules you don't want, or maybe you should upgrade or remove module1.

You could also use a BEGIN block to put the new search paths at the
end of @INC instead of the start, or you could add another 'use lib'
to ensure that '.' is among the first directories searched. But I have
to say I'm partial to organizing modules according to your needs, in
the end.

Cheers!
