Thiru Balasubramaniam, Knowledge Ecology International

"The 60th World Health Assembly is taking another important step to
change the way the WHO and Member States deal with innovation and
access.

The World Health Assembly adopted language that requests the WHO
Director-General Margaret Chan to encourage the development of
proposals for health-needs driven R&D, including those "addressing the
linkage between paying for the cost of R&D and the prices" of
medicines, vaccines, diagnostic tools and other health care products.

A number of NGOs, academic experts and country negotiators (including
Brazil, Chile, Canada and Norway) say that separating the price of
pharmaceuticals from the systems for paying for R&D can lead to more
equitable health care outcomes, and less rationing of medicines.

The African Group, the European Union and Switzerland played a
constructive role in these debates. We acknowledge the mediating role
of the Namibian chair and the aforementioned delegations in
resurrecting the spirit of Geneva and clearing the path forward for the
WHO IGWG to develop new systems for paying for R&D that are not linked
to the prices of medicines.  Examples of such approaches are direct
government funding of research, and rewards like prizes, that operate
independent from drug prices."
