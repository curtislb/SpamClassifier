Oh....SAS is quite efficient in dollar handling, at least when it comes
to the annual commercial licenses...along the same lines as the
purported efficiency of the U.S. income tax system:

  "How much money do you have?  Send it in..."

There is a reason why SAS is the largest privately held software company
in the world and it is not due to the academic licensing structure,
which constitutes only about 12% of their revenue, based upon their
public figures.

Since SPSS is mentioned, it also functions using similar economic
models...
