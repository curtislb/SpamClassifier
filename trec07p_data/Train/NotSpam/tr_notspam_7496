An anonymous reader writes "Australia's University of Queensland has
secured a $115,000 grant for a 660-gallon fuel cell that should produce 2
kilowatts of power. A [0]prototype has been operating at the university
laboratory for three months. This fuel cell type is essentially a battery
in which bacteria consume water-soluble brewing waste such as sugar,
starch and alcohol, plus in this instance produces clean water."

lab animals, from worms to mice, live up to 50% longer (or even more) on

how this works. Scientists at the Salk Institute have found a specific

[0]yamamushi asks: "Within the past few weeks, students across [1]Boerne
ISD were being called into offices to discuss the use of proxies to
circumvent the schools websense system. The problem is that some of these
students are being suspended from school for up to 3 months at a time.
Shouldn't the school district be liable for their own insecurity? Why are
they punishing so many students for something that should be handled from
the district's end? I know at the time I was going to school there, I was
punished for using a Linux LiveCD to login to their computers without
using a password, even after I told the admins how to disable booting
from CD-ROMs. They refused to update any of the computers and as such I
was using the same tactic till the day I graduated." While security
breaches by students are something to take seriously, should school
administrations continue with their knee-jerk mentality to something like
this, especially at the times when its obvious that no malicious intent
was involved?

bricko noted a story of our modern journalism world gone so wrong it
makes me sad. "Editor-in-Chief Harry McCracken [0]quit abruptly today
because the company's new CEO, Colin Crawford, tried to kill a story
about Apple and Steve Jobs." The link discusses that the CEO was the
former head of MacWorld and would get calls from Jobs. Apparently he also
told the staff that product reviews had to be nicer to vendors who
advertise in the magazine. The sad thing is that given the economics of
publishing in this day and age, I doubt anything even comes of this even
tho it essentially confirms that PC World reviews should be thought of as
no more than press releases. I know that's how I will consider links from
them in the future. But congratulations to anyone willing to stick to
their guns on such matters.

| Do We Really Need a Security Industry?                             |

[0]netbuzz noted that Bruce Schneir's latest column [1] discusses the
security industry where he points out that "The primary reason the IT
security industry exists is because IT products and services aren't
naturally secure. If computers were already secure against viruses, there
wouldn't be any need for antivirus products. If bad network traffic
couldn't be used to attack computers, no one would bother buying a
firewall. If there were no more buffer overflows, no one would have to
buy products to protect against their effects. If the IT products we
purchased were secure out of the box, we wouldn't have to spend billions
every year making them secure."

An anonymous reader asks: "I am an IT professional, and due to budget
constraints, I have been told to install multiple copies of MS Office,
despite offering to install OpenOffice, and other OpenSource Office
products. Even though most of the uses are for people using Excel like a
database, or formatting of text in cells, other programs are not
tolerated. I have been over ruled by our controller, to my disagreement.
I would never turn them in, but I am in tough place by knowing doing
something illegal. I want to keep my job, but disagree with some of the
decision making on this issue. Other than drafting a letter to the owners
of the company on how I disagree with the policy, what else can I do?"

[0]CoolVibe writes "From the abstract in the talk: "World-renowned
Science Fiction writer and futurist Bruce Sterling will outline his ideas
for SPIMES, a form of ubiquitous computing that gives smarts and
'searchabiliity' to even the most mundane of physical products. Imagine
losing your car keys and being able to search for them with Google
Earth." It's a very interesting lecture given by [1]Bruce Sterling about
something we might see in the near future. The lecture can be viewed
[2]here on Google Video."

El Lobo writes "The Mono open-source project will create [0]a Linux
version of Silverlight by the end of year, said Miguel de Icaza, a Novell
vice president and head of Mono. Asked about plans for Linux, Microsoft
executives have been non-committal, saying that it will depend on demand.
But de Icaza, who is attending Mix, was able to commit without
hesitating."

[0]NewYorkCountryLawyer writes "The RIAA seems to have a problem making
things stick in the Windy City. It has once again [1] backed down in BMG
v. Thao, after suing a misidentified defendant. Same thing occurred last
October in [2]Elektra v. Wilke. In the Thao case, the RIAA based its case
on information that the cable modem used to partake in file sharing was
registered to Mr. Thao. However, it turned out that Mr. Thao was [3]not
even a subscriber (pdf) of the [4]ISP (pdf) at the time of the alleged
file-sharing, and therefore did not have possession of the suspect cable
modem at that time."
