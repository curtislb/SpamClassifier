That is a good question.  Probably the answer is that Debian needs a wiki
specific to items like this and users' crib-sheets on how various hard-
ware-specific issues have been solved.  It could be indexed by hardware
name and any useful crossindexing.  By using a wiki, the community would
be able to keep it indexed and up-to-date.

Thanks for that.  I am going to try it when I get a moment.

That is different from the one I tried. Still, modems are history now
unless I want to run hylafax. Actually the 600E spends most of its time
in a house with no landline. And Fax is history too, anyway.

Hehe, yes.  They are getting old.  IMO, your talents would be better
used on something more current.  I was not really thinking it through
when I epressed keenness on the idea.  It is worth doing for reasonably
recent kit, but the 600E, for all that it has a better keyboard than any
other laptop I have tried, is geriatric now.

That's true.  Yes, that could be a route.  Backing up via nfs over
ethernet will work easily enough. But even that sounds like a waste
of your time unless there are a lot of us dinosaurs around.  On balance,
I'll go with trying the modprobe configuration and let the rest slip. I
use the Acer Aspire 1640Z for almost everything now, so I'd better
concentrate on solving _it's_ sound and the intractable pppd/dhclient
incompatibility.

Thanks for your help.
