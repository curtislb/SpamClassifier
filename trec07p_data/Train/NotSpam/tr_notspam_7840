A few notations, due to the issues involved with xf86-input-evdev (and
xorg/linux input in general).

Correct, we just don't handle those well at the moment, and would show
up as mouse buttons if we did.

(This may actually be preferable if done right, but.)

See above, ask if you'd like more details on the use of non-core-pointer
button devices and how we might use those here.

NAK.  Until we move to the input-hotplug xserver, and the
xf86-input-evdev for that (for former has not been released, the latter
doesn't have much of this done yet) there is simply not support for keys
above 247 or 248 (I forget which, but 0x100 - 8 or - 9).

This is due to X11 protocol restrictions which simply don't allow keys
above 255, and the fact that the first 8 keys are not valid.

In the input-hotplug xserver we have some ways we can hack around that,
but nothing that can be easily back ported.

There is simply not room below 255 that we are going to get allocated to
XO specific keys either, so in the short to medium term we're going to
have to find another solution.

Alternatively, a simple tool that takes arguments, or a config file with
comments, would also be a good choice.  But I have nothing to say
against Python for this usage if it's clean enough.


That's all that I have to say as far as input stuff goes, I may comment
on the ebook specific side of things in another email or forum though.

I've always taken the position that if you can't find anything bad to
say about a language or an operating system then you don't understand
it. I also agree with you about the advocacy. AHS. ASS.
