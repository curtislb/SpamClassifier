To explain why I reverted, rather than let it go waiting for the full 
proposal: I'm not comfortable using an environment variable to alter the 
behavior of an opcode. Among other things, it's a global change, when 
you're more likely to want a very local selection of how you load libraries.

It's fair. This is a roadblock for someone who's doing good work on 
Parrot, so we want to get it cleared out as soon as possible. In this 
case, I'll do the review. For many patches a simple code review is 
enough, but this is a change that affects the core of Parrot deeply 
enough and broadly enough that it needs architectural review. I don't 
always see every message on the mailing list, but when I miss one, you 
can email me directly, email Coke or particle so they can remind me, or 
catch me on IRC during parrotsketch.
