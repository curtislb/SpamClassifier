Hi Jerry,

first of all: wow! an impressing piece of work. I fully understand your 
patch pressure :)

I send you my UPN logon patch in a separate mail today.

Could we expand the winbindd_tdc_domain structure more so that it can 
contain at least a flag indicating whether we know if one of the remote 
domains is AD or not? We need to have this to have our "logon offline in 
AD domain, register krb5 ticket gain handler, device comes up, automatic 
ticket aquisition" path still working.

This relates to the above then.

One was the LOGON_KRB5_FAIL_CLOCK_SKEW info3 flag, that one you just 
define yourself and is not part of the dc-returned info3 structure, right?

Thanks,
Guenther
