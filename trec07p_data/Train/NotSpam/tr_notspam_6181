Hello,
    Orca doesn't have an 'espeak' module for speech synthesis, as I recall. 
What it does have is a Gnome Speech module.  Gnome Speech in turn hooks into 
Speech Dispatcher, which hooks into Espeak.
Now, I have had no difficulties with Orca forgetting any preferences of 
mine--it uses Espeak just fine.
Hope this is helpful,
Zack.
