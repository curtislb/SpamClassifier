						Today's Quote for the Day
<br>

<br>
"Tony Blair was more of a tragic than a comic figure. Zombie Brown has more=
 comic potential because he's perceived as being so serious" - comedian and=
 impressionist Rory Bremner.
<br>

<br>
<b>Palestine</b>
<br>

<br>
Jordan's King Abdullah prophesied in December last year that the truly pess=
imistic scenario for the Middle East would be three civil wars in 2007 - in=
 Iraq, in Lebanon, and in Palestine. Well, it looks like about two and a ha=
lf.=20
<br>

<br>
Tonight we'll have the latest from Gaza and the West Bank and what now look=
s like the schism between two Palestinian statelets, plus we hope to hear f=
rom a top level Israeli.=20
<br>

<br>
<b>Control Orders</b>
<br>

<br>
The Government has been consistent in its loathing of control orders for de=
aling with terrorist suspects against whom there is insufficient evidence t=
o bring charges.=20
<br>

<br>
Now we learn that one of those who absconded had links to a key player in t=
he 7/7 London bombings and the leader of the gang which tried a similar kin=
d of mayhem but was stopped just in time. We'll debate what can be done abo=
ut suspects of this type - if anything.=20=20
<br>

<br>
<b>Liveleak</b>
<br>

<br>
A British based company gets 200 videos from US soldiers a day. They show a=
 side of Iraq you rarely see on the television screens. Some are very  dist=
urbing, showing US soldiers taunting Iraqis. And the Pentagon is trying to =
stop them showing their personal record of the war.=20
<br>

<br>
<b>Broken Society</b>=20=20
<br>

<br>
Do you know what a "shank" is? If you don't then our very disturbing film f=
rom Hackney tonight will tell you about the nastiest side of our youth cult=
ure, the violence, and the hopelessness of one young man who says that if h=
e fails his exams he will pursue a career as a crack dealer. It's the stuff=
 of nightmares, but it is happening in our country.
<br>

<br>
<b>Finally</b>
<br>

<br>
On a day of uniformly grim news, my colleague Leanne lightens the load with=
 the following Joke Fit For an Eleven Year Old (Well, almost):
<br>
=20
<br>
Last night, my wife and I were sitting in the living room and I=20
<br>
said to her, "I never want to live in a vegetative state, dependent on some=
 machine and fluids from a bottle. If that ever happens, just pull the Plug=
."=20
<br>

<br>
She got up, unplugged the TV, and then threw out my beer.=20
<br>

<br>
She's Such A B**ch....
<br>
=20
<br>
Newsnight - Live and Unplugged is at 10.30pm on BBC2.
