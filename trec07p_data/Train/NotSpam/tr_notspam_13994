Presidential montage falls foul of Moscow customs

Tom Parfitt in Moscow
Thursday May 24, 2007

Art seizure: The Candle of our Life by the Blue Nose Group, a painting that pokes fun at Vladimir Putin

Alexander Pushkin flicks a cigarette lighter as Russian president Vladimir Putin warms his hand on a candle held by a beer-bellied Jesus Christ.

The trinity seems harmless enough within contemporary art's scatological canon, but this week customs officers in Moscow refused to ship the photomontage, The Candle of our Life, to an exhibition at the St?dtische Gallerie in Dresden. By coincidence, the city was Mr Putin's home as a KGB member in the 1980s.

In a sign of Russian paranoia about satirising public figures, customs officials turned away six works of art, two featuring the president.

Natalia Milovzorova, a spokeswoman for the Marat Guelman gallery, which was sending the work by a Siberian art collective, Blue Noses, said the decision was "absurd" but had been overcome by sending a digital copy. She added: "It's as if we returned to dissident times."

The St?dtische curator Johannes Schmidt told Reuters: "This is a setback for us. Russian authorities seem to be tightening the screws."

The gallery found out what had happened when ExpART, the firm shipping the art works, wrote apologising for the "inconvenience made by such a brutal decision of the customs". The firm had been advised that the works could "unleash international dissension".

Last year customs confiscated eight of Blue Noses' photos on their way to London . The images featured three members of Blue Noses wearing masks of terrorist leader Osama bin Laden, US president George Bush, and Mr Putin, all cavorting on a sofa in their underpants.

Alexander Shaburov, one of the Blue Noses, declined to comment except to say: "Sometimes in Russia a flea is turned into an elephant."

El robo de arte sacro, bajo los ojos del clero: Investigadora UNAM
Cecilia Mart?nez   

   * Es necesario tener  una relaci?n m?s estrecha con el clero, para la protecci?n a las iglesias y las medidas de prevenci?n contra el robo de arte sacro, inform? la restauradora del Instituto de investigaciones est?ticas de la Universidad Nacional Aut?noma de M?xico Gabriela Garc?a Lascura?n durante el congreso de catalogaci?n del patrimonio cultural.

Adem?s dijo que urgen m?s recursos econ?micos para el cuidado, mantenimiento y resguardo a las obras y vestigios religiosos, porque es lo ?ltimo que se apoya, ni las autoridades ni los gobiernos pueden solos, se necesita esa vinculaci?n y la participaci?n de la misma sociedad.

En el caso de la UNAM, como instituci?n asesorara y esta pendiente para dar seguimiento, pero es necesario que existan programas de mantenimiento y prevenci?n contra el robo de arte sacro, o acciones para contra restar los desastres naturales como sismos o lluvias.

Cito como ejemplo el estado de Oaxaca, donde las propias comunidades resguardan las obras religiosas e incluso fue dif?cil que permitieran para hacer la catalogaci?n de sus piezas muchas veces no lo permiten por desconfianza.

Gabriela Gac?a explic? que se dan talleres en las comunidades con los mayordomos para explicar las medidas de prevensi?n contra el robo al arte sacro, pero no ha sido suficiente, adem?s de que trabajan en coordinaci?n con INTERPOL, Procuradur?a General de la Rep?blica, porque en caso de un delito relacionado con piezas catalogadas se pueda responder de manera inmediata, se boletines y se de con los responsables.

Por ?ltimo, declar? que existen versiones encontradas sobre que medida implementar para el aseguramiento del arte sacro, algunas autoridades opinan que entre m?s se conozcan las obras va a ser m?s dif?cil que se puedan dar este robo, pero los investigadores consideran que si se publican estos cat?logos se dar?n armas a los delincuentes.

DIEBSTAHL IM NATURKUNDEMUSEUM GEAHNDET
Hochwertige Steine gemopst

COBURG/KRONACH - Ein besonders dreister Diebstahl hielt Ende November vergangenen Jahres die Kripo Coburg in Atem. Ein Unbekannter hatte damals Mineralien aus dem Naturkundemusem der Stadt Coburg und der Stadt Bamberg gestohlen und diese an einen Abnehmer verh?ckert. Zu einer Bew?hrungsstrafe von einem Jahr und neun Monaten sowie zu 150 Stunden gemeinn?tzige Arbeit wurde der einstige ?Langfinger? aus dem Raum Brandenburg am Mittwoch vom Sch?ffengericht Kronach verurteilt.

Sechs Monate lang hatte der Baumaschinenf?hrer vor dem Hauptverhandlungstermin in Untersuchungshaft verbracht, den Gerichtssaal konnte er am Ende der Verhandlung als freier Mann verlassen. Noch zu Prozessauftakt verweigerte der Angeklagte noch jegliche Angaben zu den Vorw?rfen der Staatsanwaltschaft, die lauteten:

Irgendwann in der Zeit von Juli 2005 bis November 2006 soll der Angeklagte bei Besuchen im Coburger Museum Steine im Wert von rund 1900 Euro gestohlen haben. Im gleichen Zeitraum soll er sich auch im Bamberger Museum an hochwertigen Ausstellungsst?cken im Wert von rund 500 Euro vergriffen haben. Mitangeklagt auch eine der gr??ten Diebestouren des 33-J?hrigen im Raum M?nster. Im M?rz 2006 soll er im ?Mineralogischen Museum? bei einem Besuch die Scheibe einer Vitrine eingeschlagen und seltene Erzmineralien im Wert von mindestens 100 000 Euro zerst?rt haben. Dannach soll er abgesplitterte Steinkristalle im Wert von 30 000 Euro gestohlen haben.

Im zweiten Anlauf der Verhandlung gab der 33-J?hrige am Mittwoch dann die Diebst?hle in Coburg und Bamberg zu. Er informierte, dass ihm sein Hauptabnehmer angeboten habe, ihm interessante St?cke abzukaufen. In der Zeit des Diebstahls habe er damals am Bau der B 173 mitgearbeitet. Fachwissen ?ber Mineralien habe er sich bereits in den vergangenen Jahren angeeignet. Nur zum Teil gab der Angeklagte die Diebst?hle in M?nster zu.

?Er hat mindesten 40 St?cke geklaut?, erkl?rte ein Mitarbeiter des Coburger Naturkundemuseums. Lediglich f?nf seien nach der Beschlagnahmung des Diebesgutes in die Ausstellung zur?ck gekehrt. Lange Zeit habe man im Museum nicht bemerkt, dass etwas gestohlen wurde, da der Angeklagte zum Ausgleich gef?lschte, minderwertige Mineralien in die Ausstellungsschachteln gelegt habe.

Ein Coburger Kripobeamter informierte am Mittwoch, wie der Minerialiendieb bekannt wurde. Nach der Anzeige durch die Museen habe sich ein Anrufer unter falschem Namen gemeldet und habe den 33-J?hrigen und dessen Abnehmer benannt. Bei einer Durchsuchung beim K?ufer seien dann die Steine beschlagnahmt worden.

Die Gest?ndigkeit des Angeklagten lobte Staatsanwalt Dr. Christian Pfab. Strafmildernd sei, dass der Angeklagte bereits sechs Monate in Haft gesessen habe. Nicht nachweisbar sei jedoch der Diebstahl in M?nster. Der Anklagevertreter forderte eine Bew?hrungsstrafe von zwei Jahren sowie 1500 Euro f?r eine gemeinn?tzige Einrichtung. Kritik ?bte Verteidiger Olaf Schr?der, an den Diebstahlschutzvorrichtungen der Museen. Der Verteidiger wollte eine Bew?hrungsstrafe zwischen eineinhalb und zwei Jahren.

?Die lange Untersuchungshaft war ein wesentlicher Gesichtspunkt, dass der Angeklagte nicht ins Gef?ngnis muss?, begr?ndete Richterin Sigrun G?ller die Bew?hrungsstrafe. Der Diebstahl in M?nster k?nnte dem Angeklagten nicht nachgewiesen werden, deshalb k?nne er f?r diese Taten nur wegen versuchten Diebstahls und Sachbesch?digung verurteilt werden. dd

Mastodon jawbone stolen from bait shop

May 24, 2007

WILLIAMS, Ind. --Thieves stole a 65-pound mastodon jawbone and other artifacts from a display at a bait and tackle shop. Chris Amstutz, owner of White River Bait & Tackle, said someone entered through a window early Monday morning and took the items that he had collected through the years.

"I don't think they were professionals," he said. "They dropped some stuff along the way. I'm guessing it was some kids."

Amstutz found the relic while diving for mussels in the White River in 1988. He said his display was well known in the community about 25 miles south of Bloomington.

It was a complete jawbone with four teeth still in it, he said.

The curator of paleobiology at the Indiana State Museum confirmed that the find was a mastodon jaw, Amstutz said.

He was considering offering a reward if the jawbone is returned intact.

"It took me 40 years to find this one," he said.

Albania wants its stolen antiquities back

Athens - The Greek culture ministry will examine a demand by Albania for the restitution of two ancient marble statues stolen in 1997 that subsequently turned up in Greece, officials said on Thursday.

The two headless statues representing siblings Artemis and Apollo, the ancient Greek gods of hunting and music, date from the second and third centuries BC respectively.

They were stolen from the archaeological sites of Phoenice and Butrint in southern Albania, and turned up in the possession of a Greek and an Albanian arrested in Greece in 1997, a senior police officer said.

"Our policy is to return antiquities that are the object of trafficking," said George Gligoris, head of the Greek police unit combating the looting of antiquities.

'Our policy is to return antiquities that are the object of trafficking'
"We are awaiting an official demand" to begin the process, he said.

The statues are currently stored in the museum of the port of Piraeus.

The Greek and Albanian traffickers, who have since served their sentences, had attempted to sell the statues in Athens, Gligoris said.

In 2003, Greece returned to Albania three Roman-era marble heads stolen from Butrint during the chaos that followed the fall of the Albanian communist regime in 1991.

Custodian Accused Of Stealing Museum Artifacts
POSTED: 2:19 pm PDT May 25, 2007

SAN DIEGO -- A former employee of the San Diego Natural History Museum is behind bars Friday after being arrested on suspicion of stealing items worth $15,000, according to San Diego police.

Ruben Lopez, 23, of Kensington was taken into custody Thursday, after detectives served a search warrant at his home.

Officials said they found the missing items as well as methamphetamine and drug paraphernalia inside Lopez's home.

Police said Lopez allegedly stole the items in May of 2004 when he was a custodian at the museum.

Investigators said museum proprietors initially were not certain whether the items had been stolen or misplaced during a reorganization of exhibits.

Among the artifacts recovered was a preserved hawksbill sea turtle.

"There's a lot of damage -- the bill is broken, the legs are dangling," said museum spokeswoman Delle Willett. "It looks like someone had a tug-of-war with it."

Detectives also recovered a Spanish history book dating to 1754 and some antique survey equipment.

"We have a whole new security system in place, and we are also doing background checks," Willett said. "This shouldn't happen again."

Lopez was charged with grand theft, possession of narcotics for sale and embezzlement.

12 opere d?arte ritrovate dai Carabinieri
50.000 euro il valore e tre le persone denunciate per ricettazione

I Carabinieri della stazione di Cortona dopo quattro mesi d?indagini portate avanti assieme al Nucleo per la tutela del patrimonio culturale di Firenze, hanno ritrovato dodici delle quattordici opere d?arte sottratte nel gennaio 2007 da un?abitazione cortonese.
Si tratta di oli su tela, specchiere di pregio e quadri risalenti al Seicento, al Settecento e ai primi del Novecento per un valore di circa 50.000 euro.
Il ritrovamento ? stato possibile grazie alla documentazione della signora vittima del furto, che con fotografie e una particolareggiata descrizione delle opere sottratte ha permesso agli uomini dell?Arma di muoversi negli ambienti legati al commercio di oggetti d?arte e di antiquariato.
L?indagine ha portato quindi all?identificazione di 3 persone, F.M. un cortonese di 30 anni residente a Perugia, F. V. residente a Gubbio di 55 anni e S. P. di Iesi di 61 anni che nelle proprie abitazioni e magazzini avevano nascosto la refurtiva; per loro ? scattata la denuncia per ricettazione.
Intanto i Carabinieri sono sulle tracce di coloro che hanno materialmente portato a termine il furto.

Burial cave looter faces state charges
The Kona man was convicted in federal court of helping a man remove artifacts
By Rod Thompson
rthompson@starbulletin.com

HILO ? A Kona man who pleaded guilty under federal law to conspiring to sell stolen Hawaiian artifacts from the Kanupa burial cave on the Big Island has been indicted by the state on a similar charge.

Daniel Taylor was indicted yesterday by a Big Island grand jury on a first-degree theft charge, punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a fine of $25,000.

"The state of Hawaii views any looting of Hawaiian burial sites as extraordinarily serious," said Attorney General Mark Bennett.

Taylor previously pleaded guilty to violating the federal Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990. He is awaiting sentencing.

Another defendant in the federal case, John A. Carta, was sentenced in February to a year in prison, but he died before beginning the sentence, said Edward Ayau, of Molokai.

Edward Halealoha Ayau's group, Hui Malama I Na Kupuna O Hawaii Nei, had been in charge of "repatriating" or returning museum objects to the cave from which they were taken by collector J.S. Emerson in 1858.

Those items, believed to number 157, were eventually placed in two museums, the Peabody Essex Museum in Massachusetts and the Bishop Museum in Honolulu.

During the 1990s, under the then-new federal law, Ayau's group sought their return. It received the Bishop collection in 1997 and the Peabody Essex collection early this decade, and returned all of the objects to Kanupa Cave.

According to information from the federal cases, Carta led Taylor, a dealer in collectible items, to the cave in North Kohala on June 17, 2004, and helped him remove items.

Carta admitted that Taylor paid him $200 and gave him an old car in exchange. Taylor sold at least two of the stolen items, including a fisherman's bowl for $2,083.

Ayau said from the beginning that Carta did not have enough knowledge to initiate the looting of the cave.

"How did they get to a particular cave? Somebody told them, and that somebody is still running loose who masterminded this," he said.

Bennett said it is "conceivable" that investigators will develop additional information leading to more charges.

La Iglesia plantea inventariar sus bienes para paliar los robos
25/05/2007

Varios expertos participaron en un curso sobre protecci?n del patrimonio

En obispados ?y museos de Lugo aparecen multitud de reliquias cuyo origen se desconoce

(Firma: Luc?a R. Insua | Lugar: lugo)

Los robos y la desaparici?n de piezas de gran valor hist?rico y art?stico hacen peligrar el rico patrimonio de la Iglesia en la provincia. De este modo, al aislamiento de numerosos templos se unen factores como la despoblaci?n del rural y la ausencia o ineficacia de los sistemas de seguridad como elementos disuasorios. ?En algunas parroquias han conectado alarmas a la Guardia Civil y los robos se siguen produciendo?, expuso el director del Museo Catedralicio de Ourense, Miguel ?ngel Gonz?lez, en la segunda jornada sobre conservaci?n y protecci?n del patrimonio cultural, celebrada en la Casa Diocesana de Lugo. Gonz?lez, que es adem?s delegado diocesano de patrimonio en el Obispado de Ourense, indic? que ?ltimamente el punto de mira de los hurtos se ha dirigido a bienes no art?sticos, ?como monedas de lampadarios y aparatos de megafon?a?.

Uno de los sacerdotes participantes en el congreso explic? c?mo un libro parroquial que hab?a sido robado en una rectoral cercana a Lugo fue vendido en el mercado ambulante de la plaza de la Soledad. ?Menos mal que o mercou un home que o devolveu ao Bispado?, coment?. El fiscal de Urbanismo de Lugo, Antonio Mart?nez, que tambi?n intervino en el seminario, tom? nota del caso, si bien se?al? que la Polic?a suele actuar con eficacia ya que frecuenta el lugar.

Otras veces, bienes como c?lices de plata, cruces e incluso libros de bautismo, se extrav?an ?sin mala fe? en manos de particulares a quienes se los ceden los p?rrocos para que los guarden, sin haber efectuado un documento de dep?sito.

Para paliar la situaci?n, los expertos coinciden en la importancia de inventariar el acervo de cada parroquia, una pauta que aparece recogida en el c?digo de derecho can?nigo pero que se encuentra en desuso. ?Antes el cura que se marchaba dejaba al sucesor una lista con todo lo que hab?a. Ahora que el cambio de clero es tan habitual si falta algo el sacerdote no reclama porque ni siquiera sabe que existe?, se?ala Gonz?lez.

Origen desconocido
As?, no es de extra?ar la aparici?n en obispados y museos de multitud de reliquias cuyo origen se desconoce. ?Si existe un inventario y se produce un robo se puede ense?ar una foto a la polic?a y explicar las caracter?sticas de la pieza. De otra forma, un san Roque es muy parecido a otro?, cuenta el experto en patrimonio ourensano.

Por su parte, el fiscal Antonio Mart?nez relat? que el patrimonio cultural encuentra protecci?n en la Constituci?n Espa?ola, el C?digo Penal, diversas figuras espec?ficas e incluso el C?digo Penal Militar.

Por la ma?ana, la subdirectora xeral de Protecci?n da Cidade e dos Cami?os de Santiago, Mar?a Teresa Nieto, hab?a hablado de los instrumentos que la Lei de Ordenaci?n Urban?stica e Protecci?n do Medio Rural de Galicia. Nieto expuso a los sacerdotes los instrumentos previstos por la legislaci?n para proteger y conservar el patrimonio cultural. Es el caso de los cat?logos que deben formar parte de cualquier plan general de ordenaci?n municipal, de las normas que obligan a las nuevas construcciones a adaptarse y a armonizar con el entorno en el medio rural, de los planes especiales de protecci?n que emite la Conseller?a de Cultura, de los informes sectoriales o de las autorizaciones previas que exigen determinadas actuaciones.

Arrowheads stolen from S. Utah museum

By Ben Winslow
Deseret Morning News

St. George police are investigating a heist from a museum of pioneer history artifacts.

In a midday burglary on Tuesday, the thieves walked past volunteers at the McQuarrie Memorial Museum with a collection of American Indian arrowheads.

"These Indian artifacts, there's people out there who want them to sell," said Jeniene Hamelwright, the museum's director. "The police have notified pawn shops."

Police said the men walked into the museum about 12:15 p.m., wandering through the rooms and looking at the exhibits.

"They came in and signed in, we think under assumed names," Hamelwright told the Deseret Morning News on Wednesday. "They just wanted to wander around, so our ladies did not go downstairs with them."

In the museum's basement are collections of ancient American Indian artifacts.

"They were beautifully arranged. They were just hanging on the wall," Hamelwright said. "Most of our things are locked up, but those weren't."

Museum officials said the thieves grabbed the framed displays and hid them under a cloth. They walked out a basement door, passing by a woman working on an office computer who was unaware they were stealing.

The thieves could have made a clean getaway, but Hamelwright said one of the men came back.

"He said, 'I forgot my hat,"' and headed downstairs again, Hamelwright said.

The doors are equipped with security alarms, and it was then that one of the volunteers heard the beep of a door ajar. She came downstairs and confronted the man, who inquired about a group tour and quickly left. It was then the volunteer noticed the theft.

"They saw the two men carrying them out and putting it in a car," St. George Police Sgt. Craig Harding said. "They called police."

Police are checking for fingerprints the thieves may have left behind. Harding said they have a few leads but declined to say if they have identified any suspects. Hamelwright said she believes the men were at the museum last week, perhaps casing things.

The arrowheads are valued at more than $8,000.

Hamelwright said they are looking at changes in security for the museum, which has been operated by the Daughters of Utah Pioneers since 1938.

The DUP's valuable collections of Utah historical artifacts have made tempting targets for thieves before. In April 2006, the Utah Department of Public Safety made a series of arrests in connection with a heist of rare Mormon books and medals worth more than $1 million from the DUP museum on Utah's Capitol Hill.

Anyone with information on these latest thefts is asked to call St. George police at 435-634-5001.

Raiders snatch ?1.5m antiques
By Andy Davey
STOLEN: A valuable statue

A REWARD has been offered for the return of a ?1.5million haul of valuable antique statues snatched in a raid on a flat in Bournemouth.

Burglars entered a first floor flat in Studland Road, between noon and 11.20pm on Thursday, May 17, and stole 12 Art Deco statues as well as cameras and electrical equipment.

Now police are appealing for information and an insurance company has put up a ?50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the offenders, and recovery of the stolen items.

Detective Sergeant Craig Travers of Bournemouth CID, said: "It looks like the thieves knew exactly what to take and there's no doubt that they would have used a vehicle to remove this number of items. It's my hope that by releasing pictures of some of the very distinctive statues, together with the offer of a substantial reward, anyone with any information about the burglary, or about those involved, will come forward.

"I can't rule out the possibility that the stolen items may be in the local area, perhaps being stored by someone who may not even know that they are looking after stolen property.

"It is also my hope that those dealing in art and antiques will take careful note of the details of the stolen statues and I'm appealing to any dealer who knows, or believes they know, the whereabouts of any item."

Witnesses and anyone with any information should telephone Dorset Police on 01202 222222 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.

An Impasse in Italian Talks Over Return of Artifacts
By ELISABETTA POVOLEDO
May 26, 2007

ROME, May 25 ? After months of intense discussions, negotiations between a New York antiquities collector and the Italian government have bogged down over a demand that she never be pursued by Italy again, several people close to the talks say.

Italy is seeking the return of nine artifacts from the collector, Shelby White, contending that they were looted from its soil.

Lawyers for both sides had been optimistic earlier this year that a deal could be struck. But an impasse developed over Ms. White?s insistence that in exchange for the objects, the Italian Culture Ministry grant her immunity from legal action of any kind and promise not to go after anything else she owns or acquires in the future, people familiar with the talks said.

Italian officials do not suggest that Ms. White or her husband, the financier Leon Levy, who died in 2003, knowingly bought artifacts whose provenance was suspect. But they say that forgoing potential investigations of any suspected wrongdoing in the future would essentially allow tomb robbers and dishonest dealers to traffic with impunity.

Restricting an inquiry would be tantamount to ?collaborating with the pillaging,? an Italian official who is following the negotiations asserted in an interview. He said he did not want his name used because both sides had agreed not to discuss the negotiations until a formal agreement had been struck.

Ms. White?s spokesman, Fraser Seitel, declined to discuss the specifics of the situation, but said that Ms. White ?remains hopeful that an accord will be reached.?

Over three decades Ms. White and Mr. Levy amassed one of the world?s finest private collections of classical antiquities. Some two dozen pieces in their collection are on view in the new Greek and Roman galleries at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, which were inaugurated last month. Mr. Levy and Ms. White, who is a trustee of the museum, are said to have donated about $20 million to create the galleries, whose centerpiece, a vast Roman-style court, bears their names.

Some Italian negotiators had hoped that a pact could be announced in advance of the Met opening ? one of the biggest events of the spring art season ? to heighten awareness of the looting of archaeological sites. (Some critics of Italy?s aggressive pursuit of foreign collections say that it has relied more on negative news media exposure than on moral suasion.)

Last November the Italian Culture Ministry presented Ms. White with a list of more than 20 pieces in her collection that its investigators had tracked to dealers who Italy says have been linked to looted antiquities. (The list was narrowed to nine during the negotiations.) Those dealers include Giacomo Medici, an Italian antiquities dealer who is appealing a 2004 conviction in a Rome court for dealing in illicit archaeological artifacts, and Robin Symes, a London dealer under investigation here who has not been indicted.

Italian officials say that Ms. White is under no legal obligation to return anything but that they hope to appeal to her sense of fairness. They cite recent agreements with the Met and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, which both transferred title of rare objects to Italy after being presented with evidence that they had been looted from there in recent decades.

Italy is also negotiating for the return of antiquities from the Princeton University Art Museum and the Cleveland Museum of Art. But talks have broken down with the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles. Several of the pieces Italy is demanding from the Getty originally belonged to Barbara and Lawrence Fleischman, another important collecting couple.

Adding to the pressures on the Getty, a former antiquities curator at the museum and an American dealer have been on trial in Rome since 2005 on charges of conspiring to acquire looted artifacts. The outcome of that trial and Ms. White?s negotiations with Italy have been avidly awaited by the tiny network of antiquities dealers in the United States and abroad.

Italian officials and archaeologists say that other collectors who have purchased artifacts in recent years from the galleries and dealers that are under Italian scrutiny may have cause for worry about their investments.

?If you try and resell the objects, the cultural ministry could start an injunction, and if you try to give them to a museum, it risks being asked to give it back,? said David Gill, a professor of archaeology and ancient history at the University of Wales in Swansea. ?You can?t be remembered as a great benefactor.?

In a 1999 study Mr. Gill and Christopher Chippindale, another British archaeologist, wrote that 93 percent of the objects in an exhibition of Levy-White artifacts at the Met had no established provenance.

Mazhari wanted tax benefits, art theft trial told
IRWIN BLOCK
The Gazette
Friday, May 25, 2007

Paintings allegedly stolen from a prominent Montreal artist were to be donated to museums in return for tax benefits, a Superior Court trial was told yesterday.

Guy Coupal, a former companion of Olympic gold medal biathlete Myriam Bedard, offered this opinion while testifying at the jury trial of Bedard's current companion, Nima Mazhari.

Mazhari, an artist, is accused of theft and possession of stolen goods - which are alleged to be 20 paintings by the late Ghitta Caiserman-Roth, with whom he shared a studio from December 2001 to November 2003. They are valued at a total of $100,000.

Justice Wilbrod Claude Decarie did not strike Coupal's remark from the record, but warned him: "Don't tell stories. Just answer the questions." Coupal, a Montreal police officer, said he found Mazhari "very invasive" when in the winter of 2001 he starting calling Coupal's Nuns' Island condo, which he shared with Bedard.

Mazhari planned to include Bedard in a coffee-table book he was planning on 100 Quebec women, but Coupal was suspicious. "She was getting indoctrinated by him. ... I did not want to hear about him," he testified.

In December 2001, Coupal said Bedard asked him to look for a "covered vehicle" to collect paintings that belonged to Mazhari and "a famous painter." Myriam Bedard previously told the court she never made the request.

Coupal said he did not know how 20 paintings were delivered to his condo. He was told they were "given" to Mazhari and never suspected they were stolen.

He said he went to police, about the time new reports circulated that the works may have been stolen, to distance himself from any criminal act.

Coupal recalled hanging about 10 of the works on the walls, some with Bedard's help, and he noticed price tags of $7,500 and $7,000 on two works. "I would never pay that amount," he remarked.

Showed pictures of works that allegedly were stolen, Coupal said he could not say for sure if they were among the artworks in his house.

The trial is to continue today.

ICOM calls for repatriation of cultural properties abroad
May 24th, 2007

The International Council of Museum (ICOM) has called for the repatriation of African cultural properties in foreign museums.
Obinna Emelike and Priscilla Olakunle

The call was made by Violetta Ekpo, Nigerian representative to the Paris-based ICOM, in her lecture titled: Museums and Universal Heritage: The right to ownership, which was part of the activities marking the World Museums Day, organised by the Centre for Black and African Arts & Civilization (CBAAC) recently at the National Theatre, Lagos.

Ekpo said that the need for the repatriation of the antiquities was informed by the fact that most African cultural materials in foreign museums were acquired through illegal means.

"Usually, such items are prohibited for export. The transfer of ownership rights of such cultural properties is illegal, if done contrary to the protection laws and regulations adopted by its state of origin".

She noted that United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), in its 1970 International Convention, recognises as a nation?s property under protection, the one that has been created by its nationals or other national within the territory of the state, found within the national territory, or acquired through authorised archaeological, ethnological or scientific missions, or through legal exchange, donation or purchase.

She urged Africa and Nigeria in particular, to take advantage of the UNESCO?s Information Kit on the Return and Restitution of Cultural Property (UNIDROIT) Convention, which provides for the return of stolen or illegally exported cultural property to their country of origin, to demand for the reparation of her illegally acquired antiquities in several European museums.

On return, the antiquities according to her, would constitute a huge tourism attraction by wooing foreigners to come and see them here, and enabling Africans to have a better understanding of their history, and proper identification with their cultural heritage.

The ICOM representative however, said that Nigeria should strengthen her law, regulations and export policies to safe guard further illicit trading on her antiquities and to protect exiting ones.

She urged Nigeria to provide adequate facilities to house the antiquities on their return to the country. The lack of facilities and experienced curators/personnel, according to her, has been one of the reasons most foreign museums give for not returning them back to their country of origin.

She further said that UNESCO and ICOM, in collaboration with other organisations such as INTERPOL, WCO among others have adopted additional measures for the protection of cultural property and facilitating the repatriation of illegally displaced cultural items.

In his address, Aremu Dada, acting chairman, governing board, CBAAC, said the event signifies the first time the centre is fulfilling its obligation as a strategic member ICOM.

He disclosed that CBAAC was established as a follow-up of FESTAC?77, and as a modest way of institutionalising the gains of the historic festival, noting that the Centre has been waxing stringer since then in the promotion and propagation of Black and African cultural heritage.

In his remarks, Tunde Babawale, director/chief executive, CBAAC, said the Centre is marking the World Museums Day because museums are as germane to human history as culture is to a people?s existence.

Babawale noted that the topic of the commemorative lecture was most appropriate and applicable to CBAAC, now the Centre has started mounting pressure on the British Museum for the release of the original sample of the FESTAC? 77 mask which is in their possession.

He noted that Nigerian government deemed it necessary to create a museum of Black and African Arts and Civilization to preserve the numerous works of art displayed at the successful Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture (FESTAC), hosted by Nigeria in 1977.

"Since inception, CBAAC, which was established by the 59 Black and African countries that participated in the festival, as a child of necessity, has taken custody of all these materials and artefacts, which are consistently augmented", the director/chief executive said.

Other events marking the celebration include an exhibition titled: Museum and Universal Heritage held at the Exhibition Hall of the Centre which displayed cultural paintings, drawings, wood works among others that depicted the richness and trueness of the African cultural heritage and historical development.

It also witnessed several dance performances by different cultural groups, a roundtable discussion, question/answer session by the participants which include students from some secondary schools in Lagos.

May 18 of every year has been set aside by ICOM Paris to commemorate World Museums Day, with mandate to all cultural agencies, member countries and individuals in the service of humanity to observe.

Antiquities Department asks political faction to evacuate Basra Museum
By Amar Abed
Azzaman, May 26, 2007

A political faction has occupied the premises of Basra Museum which used to house thousands of archaeological relics.

The Basra Museum was looted shortly after U.S.-led invasion of the country in 2003. The British troops who occupied Basra did nothing to protect the museum.

The museum?s collection of magnificent and priceless artifacts was stolen or broken and homeless families moved into its premises.

A statement by The Antiquities Department faxed to the newspaper says the museum and its annexes are now occupied by an influential political faction in Basra which paid off the families to persuade them to move.

The statement did not name the political party but said its leaders were demanding huge sums of money before leaving. 

Most of the museum?s possessions are still missing and the building itself is in need of repairs and renovation.

The statement said the department has received numerous artifacts that belonged to the Basra Museum. It said it hoped its reopening would persuade those still holding its relicts to return them.

The statement said it has received 12 tablets out of hundreds which used to be housed in the museum.

The retrieved collection also includes 72 pottery pieces, 177 coins as well as 33 artifacts representing different stages of Mesopotamian history.

Felony charge for student in Nobel Prize medal theft

OAKLAND ? The University of California, Berkeley, student arrested for stealing the university's first Nobel Prize medal has been charged with felony grand theft and could face up to one year in prison.

Ian Michael Sanchez, 22, who worked at the Lawrence Hall of Science when he was arrested for stealing the medal, was arraigned Friday, a spokeswoman for the Alameda County District's Office said.

He is due back in court on June 8 to enter a plea.

The coin-like 1939 Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to Professor Ernest O. Lawrence for the invention of the cyclotron, an accelerator of sub-atomic particles that led to the nuclear age. The medal was in a locked display case at the Lawrence Hall of Science in the Berkeley hills when it was stolen in late February.

It was recovered a few days later after Sanchez showed the 23-karat gold award, worth $4,200, to friends and one of them reported the theft to authorities, police said.

He was later arrested and released on bail.

The 4-ounce prize had been housed with other artifacts of Lawrence's life and work in the publicly accessible and sprawling E.O. Lawrence Memorial Room at the science museum. Hall of science spokeswoman Linda Schneider said the theft, and now the criminal charge, is disturbing considering the museum is usually a safe and quiet place.

"Everybody was pretty saddened by it and even more so now that it's such a serious charge," Schneider said.

The medal has been moved to a "very secure location" and out of public view, Schneider said.

A replica of the award is on display, she said.

The real medal will be returned to a new display as part of the commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the Lawrence Hall of Science in May 2008, Schneider said.

Schneider added that there "definitely has been discussion about security issues" since the theft.

Schneider said Sanchez, who earned roughly $10 an hour when he worked at the Hall of Science, told authorities he used a key to open the small lock on the medal's display case and snatched the medal "on a whim." Police said the lock was jimmied.

Sanchez may also face student conduct charges ? a warning, suspension or expulsion ? but that was not known Friday.

"Federal student privacy regulations prohibit the university from commenting on anything related to disciplinary actions involving the student," UC spokeswoman Mudle Felde said.

Sanchez was not available for comment late Friday.

Lawrence died in 1958. The Lawrence Hall of Science was named in his honor. One of his cyclotrons, not the first, which was teacup size, is displayed in front of the Hall of Science, a university spokesman said.
