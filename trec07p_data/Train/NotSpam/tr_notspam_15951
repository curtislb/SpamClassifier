You say it right here, "when change an interface".
What would be nice, is to have something like in samba4, where you can
mark an interface as public or private, and have a much better
dependency driven set of auto-generated proto headers.

Changing a private interface pose no problem, the real problem is with
public interfaces, well I'd agree to keep manually changing public
interfaces eventually, as that would make you immediately (hopefully :)
understand you are changing a public facing interface non just an
internal function.

But for most of the internal code, having to change headers by hand is
just an annoying slowdown imo.

I agree we have a problem with bad internal dependencies, and that we
could have a better way to build and manage them so that modularization
is easier. But I think that going back to just manually built headers is
not necessarily the best way to go.

I agree with Tridge that the Samba4 build system shows we can achieve a
better system that address all concerns.

Simo.
