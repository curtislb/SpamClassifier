WIPO Development Agenda: Language on open collaborative models in

June 15th, 2007 by Thiru Balasubramaniam

We have heard that negotiations have finished on Cluster D and E were
wrapped up last evening.   Cluster C has one issue pending. As of 10 AM
Geneva time, only the text of Cluster D was available.  Particularly
significant is the agreement on the text of having WIPO Member States
exchange information on experiences  on open collaborative projects
such as the Human Genome Project.  Also important was the agreement on
language on impact assessment studies.

“Annex B
Cluster D: Assessments, Evaluation and Impact Studies
Draft Agreed Proposals”

     1. To exchange experiences on open collaborative projects such as
the Human Genome Project as well as on IP models.

     2. Upon request and as directed by Member States, WIPO may conduct
studies on the protection of intellectual property, to identify the
possible links and impacts between IP and development.

     3. To strengthen WIPO’s capacity to perform objective assessments
of the impact of the organization’s activities on development.
