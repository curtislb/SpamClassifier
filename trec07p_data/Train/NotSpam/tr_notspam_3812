09:10 a.m., 04/21/07, Update: Soyuz brings outgoing station crew, space tou=
rist, back to Earth

After a fiery plunge from space, a Soyuz descent module carrying outgoing s=
pace station commander Mike Lopez-Alegria, Mikhail Tyurin and U.S. space to=
urist Charles Simonyi made a safe parachute descent to Kazakhstan today, la=
nding at 8:31:30 a.m. EDT. Touchdown marked the end of a 215-day flight for=
 Lopez-Alegria and Tyurin, the 14th crew to live aboard the international s=
pace station, and the end of a two-week voyage by Simonyi, who rode into or=
bit April 7 with two new station crew members as the fifth space tourist to=
 visit the lab complex.

Landing originally was targeted for Friday, but Russian mission managers, c=
oncerned about wet conditions at the normal landing zone, delayed entry one=
 day to permit the Soyuz to reach a more southerly zone where conditions we=
re more acceptable. Russian recovery forces stationed nearby quickly conver=
ged on the spacecraft to help the returning crew members get out of the cra=
mped capsule.

Live television from Kazakhstan showed the Soyuz TMA-9 descent module resti=
ng on its side under a bright blue afternoon sky, surrounded by technicians=
 and flight surgeons. About 15 minutes after touchdown, technicians carried=
 Tyurin out of the capsule, followed by Simonyi and Lopez-Alegria. Simonyi =
looked and moved normally after his relatively short flight while Tyurin an=
d Lopez-Alegria moved more slowly and appeared tired as they felt the pull =
of gravity for the first time in seven months.

Smiling and answering questions, Simonyi described the flight as "fantastic=
" and "everything I expected."

"Good to be back, good to be back on Earth. Fantastic," he said.

Said Lopez-Alegria: "It was about what I expected. But it feels good. ... I=
t's all good."

NASA spokesman Rob Navias said by satellite phone from the landing site "th=
e preliminary indication from the flight surgeons here on the ground is tha=
t all three crew members are in excellent shape."

After medical checks and refreshments, the spacemen will be flown to Star C=
ity near Moscow for debriefing, reunions with friends and family members an=
d the start of the physical rehabilitation needed to readjust to gravity.

"Thank you very much for the hospitality. I enjoyed working here and workin=
g with the excellent crews and commanders," Simonyi said during a farewell =
ceremony aboard the space station earlier this morning. "It is a bitterswee=
t moment for all of us. We are very sad leaving the station but at the same=
 time looking forward to continuing our work on Earth."

Lopez-Alegria echoed those sentiments early Friday, saying "we have very mi=
xed emotions about leaving, but it doesn't matter what we think - it is tim=
e. I just want to pass on for the whole crew that we've had a blast. It's b=
een a short seven months in a way, but it's time to come home and hand over=
 the torch to the next crew. ... It's been our pleasure."

Lopez-Alegria and Tyurin blasted off Sept. 18, accompanied by space tourist=
 Anousheh Ansari. She returned to Earth Sept. 28 with the outgoing Expediti=
on 13 crew while Tyurin and Lopez-Alegria joined European Space Agency astr=
onaut Thomas Reiter, who rode to the station last summer on a space shuttle=
. Last December, Reiter was replaced by NASA astronaut Sunita Williams, who=
 arrived aboard the shuttle Discovery. Now part of the Expedition 15 crew, =
joining commander Fyodor Yurchikhin and flight engineer Oleg Kotov, William=
s plans to return to Earth later in the summer.

"It's hard to believe we were just having tea with them a couple of hours a=
go," Williams marveled from the space station, watching live television fro=
m the landing zone beamed up from mission control in Houston.

Lopez-Alegria, a veteran of three earlier shuttle missions, now holds the U=
.S. record for the longest single flight. He also ranks second on the list =
of most experienced spacewalkers, with 67 hours and 40 minutes of EVA time.
