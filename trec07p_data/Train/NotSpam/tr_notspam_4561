	Many years ago I picked up from the snews mailing list a
	suite of functions for plotting 2D barplots (barplots with 2D
	bases) written by a chap named Colin Goodall, from (at that
	time) the University of Bristol and/or from Penn State.

	I never actually did anything with this suite until
	recently.  Seeing no replies to the enquiry about 3D
	histograms,  I thought I'd try to get Goodal's code running
	in R to see if it might solve guarav's problem.

	The trouble is, all the guts of the procedure, *including*
	the plotting are done from within Fortran.  The actual
	plotting seems to be done through a call to a subroutine
	``segmtz'' which is a piece of Splus software that does not
	exist in R.

	Is there an equivalent subroutine in R that could be called?
	I dug around a bit but couldn't figure out what was going
	on.  The function segments() simply calls
	.Internal(segments(....

	I looked around a bit for corresponding C or Fortran code but
	obviously didn't know how to look properly.

	I think that the Fortran code could be translated into raw R
	and the call to segmtz changed to a call to segments() ---
	but this would seem to be a lot of work.

	Can anyone suggest a reasonably simple way of replacing the
	call to segmtz in the Fortran?

                                        cheers,

                                                Rolf Turner
