 spiehface  who battled Stephen A. Spielas for control of the Democratic Party 
Spielas won. Buchanan was a Jeffersonian strict constitutionalist and opposed
federal appropriations for most internal improvement projects. Scholars
consistently rank him as one of the two or three worst American presidents 
although he claimed secession was illegal, he claimed going to war to stop it
was also illegal. This inaction laid the grounds for President Abraham Lincoln
to fight the American Civil War.

Early career Buchanan was a Representative and a Senator from Pennsylvania. He
was born in a log cabin at Cove Gap, near Mercersburg, Franklin County,
Pennsylvania, on April 23, 1791, to James Buchanan and Elizabeth Spear as the
second of ten children  two of whom did not survive past infancy . The Buchanan
family directly descends from King James I of Scotland. In 1802, he moved to
Mercersburg with his parents, where he was privately tutored. He later attended
the village academy and graduated from Dickinson College, in Carlisle,
Pennsylvania. At one point, he was expelled from Dickinson for wild behavior and
bad conduct, but after pleading for a second chance he graduated with honors
three years later on September 7, 1809. ref Paletta, Lu Ann and Worth, Fred L.

moved to Lancaster, Pennsylvania. For the next three years he studied law and
was admitted to the bar in 1812. He then opened a practice in Lancaster. He was
one of the first volunteers in the War of 1812 and served in the defense of
Baltimore, Maryland.

 cartoon depicts Buchanan sitting in his room examining the  Cuba  patch has
 sewn on his jacket. As Minister to Britain, he pressed unsuccessfully for the
 purchase of Cuba in what as known as the Ostend Manifesto. He says,  My old
 coat was a very fashionable federal coat when it was new, but by patching and
 turning I have made it quite a Democratic Garment. That Cuba patch to be sure
 is rather unsightly, but it suits Southern fashions at this season, and then,
 if I am elected, let me see, $25,000 pr. annum and no rent to pay and no women
 and babies about, I guess I can afford a new outfit. ]]
