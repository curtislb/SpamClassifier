The  Carolina Parakeet   Conuropsis carolinensis ref  Conuropsis, from
 Conurus , an obsolete name of the genus [[Aratinga]]  cf. conure and see also
 Synonyms  above , and   opsis ,  of similar appearance to . carolinensis,  from
Carolina .  ref   was the only parrot species native to the eastern United
States. It was found from the Ohio Valley to the Gulf of Mexico, and lived in
old forests along rivers. It was the only species at the time classified in the
genus  Conuropsis . It was called  puzzi la nee    head of yellow   or  pot pot
chee  by the Seminole and  kelinky  in Chikasha  Snyder   Russell, 2002 .

The last wild specimen was killed in Okeechobee County in Florida in 1904, and
the last captive bird died at the Cincinnati Zoo in 1918. This was the male
specimen  Incas,  who died within a year of his mate  Lady Jane.  It was not
until 1939, however, that it was determined that the Carolina parakeet had
ceased to be.

At some date between 1937 and 1955, 3 parakeets resembling this species were
sighted and filmed in the Okefenokee Swamp of Georgia. However, the American
Ornithologists Union concluded after analyzing the film, that they had probably
filmed feral parakeets. Additional reports of the bird were made in Okeechobee
County in Florida until the late 1920s, but these are not supported by
specimens.

Reasons for extinction The Carolina Parakeet died out because of a number of
different threats. To make space for more agricultural land, large areas of
forest were cut down, taking away its living space. The colorful feathers  green
body, yellow head, and red around the bill  were in demand as decorations in
ladies  hats, and the birds were kept as pets. Even though the birds bred easily
in captivity, little was done by owners to increase the population of tamed
birds. Finally, they were killed in large numbers because farmers considered
them a pest, although many farmers valued them for controlling invasive
cockleburs.

A factor that contributed to their extinction was the unfortunate flocking
behavior that led them to return immediately to a location where some of the
birds had just been killed. This led to even more being shot by hunters as they
gathered about the wounded and dead members of the flock.

This combination of factors extirpated the species from most of its range until
the early years of the 20th century. However, the last populations were not much
hunted for food or feathers, nor did the farmers in rural Florida consider them
a pest as the benefit of the birds  love of cockleburs clearly outweighed the
minor damage they did to the small scale garden plots. The final extinction of
the species is somewhat of a mystery, but the most likely cause seems to be that
the birds succumbed to poultry disease, as suggested by the rapid disappearance
of the last, small, but apparently healthy and reproducing flocks of these
highly social birds. If this is true, the very fact that the Carolina Parakeet
was finally tolerated to roam in the vicinity of human settlements proved its
undoing  Snyder   Russell, 2002 .

The Louisiana subspecies of the Carolina Parakeet, C. c. ludovicianus ref 
ludovicianus,  from Louisiana .  ref , was slightly different in color to the
parent species, being more bluish green and generally of a somewhat subdued
coloration, and went extinct in much the same way, but at a somewhat earlier
date  early 1910s . The Appalachians separated these birds from the eastern C.
c. carolinensis

In museums About 720 skins and 16 skeletons are housed in museums around the
world  Luther, 1996 . Of the 49 supposed egg specimens McKinley  1977  accepted
20 as certainly and 7 as probably correctly assigned to this species. 5 eggs
controversially attributed to this species that were collected in Florida on
April 30, 1927  FSM     check whether the same as Florida Museum of Natural
History     87234   3 eggs   and 89434   2 eggs . These are not accepted as
valid by McKinley  1977  based on their small size and early date of collection,
but molecular analysis could possibly determine whether these are in fact eggs
of Carolina Parakeets.

A fossil parrot, Conuropsis fratercula ref  fratercula, from Latin for  little
brother . This was a smaller bird, three quarters the size of the Carolina
Parakeet.  ref , was described based on a single humerus from the Miocene Sheep
Creek Formation  possibly late Hemingfordian, c.16 mya, possibly later  of Snake
Creek, Nebraska  Wetmore, 1926 . However, it is not altogether certain that this
species is correctly assigned to Conuropsis  Olson, 1985 , but some authors
consider it a paleosubspecies of the Carolina Parakeet. This is almost certainly
erroneous given the long distance in time, and probably based on a
misunderstanding of the original description. Therein, C. fratercula is called a
 new subspecies  but fratercula is consistently applied as a species level name
throughout the publication, and the fossil is correctly referenced thus in the
discussion   blockquote  The present species is of peculiar interest as it
represents the first known parrotlike bird to be described as a fossil from
North America.   Wetmore 1926  italics added   blockquote 

Parakeets in the US Although the extinction of the Carolina Parakeet represents
the irrevocable loss of eastern North America s only truly indigenous parrot,
