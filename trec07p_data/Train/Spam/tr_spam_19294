<P>Dear Memo,</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can hardly type fast enough today as I sit here=
 in front of my keyboard because I know that what I'm about to tell you is s=
o powerful and the benefits to you will be so immediate, there isn't a momen=

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recently discovered that a beautiful bracelet m=
ade of pure silver on your wrist can mean the difference to you right now be=
tween wanting and having, rejoicing and despairing!</P>
<P align=3Dcenter><IMG alt=3D"" src=3D"http://www2.myhealthwealthandhappines=

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I have found for you is the Bracelet of Powe=
r, named for all the positive forces and energies that it will harness and b=
ring into your life to positively transfigure it.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memo, you are at an&nbsp;important crossroad righ=
t now, a real defining moment so please read this very carefully.</P>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>I had a vision that spelled out everything crucial<BR>t=

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning as I awoke, before I could actually =
focus my sight, there appeared before me a beautiful, shimmering Technicolor=
 rainbow. At the end of it stood a huge pot with shining gold piled high and=
 spilling over the sides. More than you can even begin to imagine!</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that same bright rainbow-lit sky there appeare=
d 5 exquisite Chinese characters, hand-drawn, stretching out as far and as w=
ide as my eyes could see. Suddenly, a great shower of silver began to pour d=
own, brilliant, resplendent silver and just then, a shrouded figure walked t=
hrough that shower with arms outstretched and palms upturned, ready to recei=
ve the magnificent bounty of these unforeseen riches. Now I cannot help but =
wonder Memo, and my heart is beating very fast as I type this, <EM>could</EM=
> that person be <U>you</U>?</P>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>Your life is about to change in all the ways that mean =
most to you</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if I told you that following a certain date,=
 and a date not at all far off, with just a little help from you, your entir=
e life could be radically transformed into the kind of life you have only dr=
eamed about, read about, seen in movies? Memo, that's EXACTLY what I'm sayin=
g.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if I said that from now on you can live anyp=
lace you like, travel in luxury anywhere you choose, drive fancy cars, enter=
tain on a lavish scale and buy yourself <I>everything </I>you feel like buyi=
ng ALL the time?</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the blessings of warm enduring friendships a=
nd all the love you've ever wanted can all be yours remarkably easily?</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That you could step out of your chauffeur-driven =
limousine in Paris into the fanciest jeweler and select gifts for yourself, =
your friends and family that cost more than most people earn in 5 years?</P>=

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I'm saying, Memo, is that a spectacular futu=
re is waiting to unfold for you and all you have to do is reach out and grab=
 it with both hands!</P>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>Wealth and happiness can truly be yours!<BR>STARTING ON=
 MAY 16TH TO BE PRECISE...</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that I have been writing your forecast for a =
while, I can imagine your frustrations and disappointments, of the direction=
s you'd like your life to go in and the fulfillment, financial, emotional, s=
piritual, physical that continually eludes you.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Memo, starting on May 16th, all of that can s=
tart you on a new path, a completely positive and different journey of wealt=
h and good fortune, better health and more loving relationships.</P>

<P align=3Dcenter><B>May 16th can be a spectacular day for you<BR></B><B>you=
'll never forget</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May 16th, Uranus,  the planet of sudden breakt=
hroughs and new beginnings, is at a pivotally strong point in its cycle and =
what this means for you is that this will help you to decipher just what nee=
ds to be done to achieve success! Obstacles can easily be removed, self-doub=
t can be removed and then strength and clarity, positive change and rich rew=
ards will take their place.</P>

<P align=3Dcenter><B>The Bracelet that opens up the world to you</B><B>&nbsp=
;</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memo, building upon my vision about the shower of=
 abundant silver and the Chinese characters, combining that with all of the =
strength that May 16th has to offer you, when I came upon this mystical and =
magical talisman, I knew I must waste no time in telling you about it becaus=
e it is so imperative that you have it in your possession by that very impor=
tant date. There is no time to waste!</P>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>A thing of Beauty, a tool of Power</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bracelet of Power is beautiful enough to stan=
d alone, even <I>without </I>it's extraordinary talismanic abilities. Five C=
hinese characters, each representing an area in your life about to be happil=
y transformed, dance across this delicately crafted yet substantial bracelet=
 in solid sterling silver.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning on May 16th, that special day for you, =
wear your Bracelet of Power and concentrate especially hard on one of the ch=
aracters, the Fu character, which activates the blessing of good fortune. Fo=
cus on it, close your eyes and say a little prayer every day you want it to =
work for you.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, every week, you will focus and concentrate =
on a different character.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the Fu character, there are 4 more cha=
racters to activate:<BR><BR></P></TD>

<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Memo, to make sure your Bracelet is stored aw=
ay in a box that befits its importance and helps the Bracelet retain its pow=
ers when not in use, I will send you&nbsp;a stunning red velvet presentation=
 box.</P>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>Your FIRST FREE gift: The book that points you<BR>in th=
e direction of maximum rewards, success and good fortune</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the mystery, lore and history of these Chi=
nese characters, it is rumored to date back 5,000 years, to the time of the =
Yellow Emperor. A historian named Canjie sat on the ground one night observi=
ng the transformation of the moon and the footprints of the animals around h=
im and was inspired to create Chinese script, the first characters ever and =
an invention that was said to astound the deities and man alike.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In traditional Chinese society, it was believed t=
hat written words were the language of heaven and the knowledge of words mea=
nt an exalted position of personal communication with heaven.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your Bracelet of Power, I will send you an i=
ntriguing and comprehensive booklet that explores this lore further, in rich=
 detail, as well as teaching you how to bless and use your Bracelet for the =
maximum rewards.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memo, just for taking this vital step and reachin=
g out for the Bracelet of Power to radically remake your life, I will reward=
 you with this splendid and opulent serpentine teardrop pendant. Serpentine =
is a powerful healing stone that aids the clearing of blocked areas and is s=
aid to promote good luck and can help people reach their business and person=
al dreams and desires. PLUS, I will also send you a silver-plated chain and =
an organza&nbsp;pouch for storing and keeping it.</P></TD>

<P align=3Dleft>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And perhaps the best part of all is =
that right now, because of my urgent and commanding vision with the Chinese =
characters AND because the vital date of May 16th is fast approaching, I wil=
l send all of this to you for THE LOWEST PRICE YOU CAN IMAGINE, for just $6.=
95 to cover shipping and handling, so you can have a full 30 days to use and=
 try the Bracelet of Power without any commitment whatsoever.</P>
<P align=3Dleft>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, after 30 days, you choose to kee=

or four easy installments of only $24.95, but only if you're completely sati=
sfied.&nbsp;</P>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>My Unconditional Lifetime Money-back Guarantee:<BR></B>=

<P align=3Dleft>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experience the incredible results! B=

g you hoped it would be, just send it back to me and I will refund your paym=
ent immediately, including shipping and handling. No questions, no arguments=
 and no explanations necessary. But no matter what, you can still keep the s=
erpentine teardrop pendant, silver chain and pouch and booklet as my gifts t=
o you.</P>

<P align=3Dleft>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memo, please don't delay. You are ju=
st a few tiny steps away from having everything you've ever dreamed of and m=
ore. Perhaps it's an unexpected, dearly-needed windfall of cash, a call from=
 an old friend or love you didn't know how to locate, or an offer of a fanta=
stic job you wanted but didn't dare hope for...</P>

<P align=3Dleft>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want you to know, Memo, one small =
