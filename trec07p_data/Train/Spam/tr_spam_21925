All About Blz Newsletter for May 5/6/2007



This is a time sensitive message. Space is limited so act now.


Want to stay home and still provide a comfortable life for you and your family?

Well here is the good news. YOU CAN!

We are looking for well spoken individuals who have a telephone and can return calls for us.

Is that you?

Myself and others do this every day and are having a blast. Sit at home, stay in your PJs if you like as thats not important. Many of us are currently generating upwards of 3k daily and you can too.

Just pick up that phone, dial  8 O O  5 3 8  6 7 O 4  and listen to my message.

Call 24hrs/7days without c0st or 0bligation.

IMPORTANT:

Act now, pick up that phone and call. We only have so many spaces available and I don't want you to miss out.

That number again is 8 O O  5 3 8  6 7 O 4

Regards

I look forward to hearing from you but if you choose not
to call then let me know Solis@cowput.com
