Hello,

Good day, My name is Ocha Spielas, i am working with a bank here in
Nigeria as a Manager. I am writing you in respect of a foreign customer
whom made a US$10.5M depository for an investment program that has
remained dormant for years, up till then i did not heard from him not
until when i received a news that there was a tsunami disaster in Asia
that kill thousands of Indonesia’s, include one of our Bank customer
Mr.Haryanto. Hence, I have decided to contact you due to the urgency of
this transaction.On personal investigation, I discovered that the account
holder died on December 26, 2004 in tsunami disaster . I made further
investigation and discovered that the customer died without making a WILL
on the depository.


Right now I am contacting you to help receive and safely secure the money
over there as his relatives or next of kin, since all my effort to  locate
his family with the telephone number he gave me (62853700612) proved
nothing, if you are willing to do this deal, you should not in any reason
tell anybody about this transaction until you confirm the money in your
account/home, because all we need is to get the document of (change of
ownership account from the federal high court) on your behalf and the
money will be release to you as beneficiary next of kin to the  deceased.

Please kindly furnish me with your information

1. Your Full Name/Contact Address
2.Your Personal Telephone Number for effective communication.
3. Your Age/Occupation

Please treat this letter with utmost confidentiality and trust. We cannot
afford to toy with this rare opportunity of a lifetime. It may interest
you to know that this is no Scam or fairy tale email.

If this proposal is acceptable by you, I expect that you will not take
undue advantage of the trust I Will bestow in you.

Best Regards

Ocha Spielas
