Dear valued member!
We are writing to inform you about the result of the recent research concerning the quality of the drugs sold on the Internet.
Recently, a research aimed at monitoring the quality of the drugs sold at the most popular online pharmacies has been made. The results of this research were rather surprising. Only one out of 53 Web drugstores – USDrugs – has proved its meds to be 100% generic.
Hope that this letter would be useful for you, your friends and relatives.Please click here for more information.
With Best Regards,  Octavio Anthony
USDrugs B.V.
