 Cricket  is a bat and ball sport played between two teams, usually of eleven
players each. A cricket match is played on a grass field  which is usually
roughly oval , in the centre of which is a flat strip of ground 22 nbsp yards
 20.12 nbsp m  long, called a    pitch   . At each end of the pitch is a set of
three parallel wooden stakes  known as stumps  driven into the ground, with two
small crosspieces  known as bails  laid on top of them. This wooden structure is
called a  [[wicket]] . A player from the fielding team  the  [[bowler
 cricket /bowler]]   bowls a hard, fist sized cork centred leather ball from one
wicket towards the other. The ball usually bounces once before reaching a player
from the opposing team  the  [[batsman]]  , who defends the wicket from the ball
with a wooden cricket bat. The batsman, if he or she does not get  [[dismissal
 cricket /out]] , may then run between the wickets, exchanging ends with the
other batsman  the  non striker  , who has been standing in an inactive role
near the bowler s wicket, to score runs. The other members of the bowler s team
stand in various positions around the field as  [[fielder]]s . The match is won
by the team that scores more runs.

Cricket has been an established team sport for hundreds of years. It originated
in its modern form in England and is popular mainly in the present and former
members of the Commonwealth. In the countries of South Asia, including India,
Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, cricket is the most popular sport. It is
also a major sport in places such as England and Wales, Australia, New Zealand,
South Africa, Zimbabwe, Bermuda, and the English speaking countries of the
Caribbean, which are collectively known in cricketing parlance as the West
Indies. There are also well established amateur club competitions in countries
as diverse as the Netherlands, Kenya, Nepal and Argentina, among others  there
are over one hundred cricket playing nations recognised by the International
Cricket Council. ref   ref 

The sport is followed with passion in many different parts of the world. It has
even occasionally given rise to diplomatic outrage, the most notorious being the
Basil D Oliveira affair which led to the banning of South Africa from sporting
events. Other examples include the Bodyline series, played between England and
Australia in the early 1930s, and the 1981 underarm bowling incident involving
Australia and New Zealand.

Overview


The aim of the batting team is to score as many  [[run  cricket /runs]]  as
possible. A run is scored when both batsmen successfully move to their
respective opposite ends of the pitch  wicket .  The batsmen will usually only
attempt to score runs after the striker has hit the ball, but this is not
necessary.  Runs are also scored if the batsman propels the ball to the
 boundary  of the playing area  six runs if the ball reaches the boundary
without touching the ground, otherwise four runs , or if the bowler commits some
infringement.

The aim of the bowler s team is to get each batsman  [[dismissal
 cricket /out]]   this is a  wicket , or a  dismissal  . Dismissals are achieved
in a variety of ways. The most direct way is for the bowler to bowl the ball in
such a way that it evades the batsman s guard and hits the stumps, dislodging
the  [[bail  cricket /bails]] . While the batsmen are attempting a run, the
fielders may attempt to knock the bails off either set of stumps with the ball
before the batsman nearer to that set of stumps has reached the crease. Other
ways for the fielding side to dismiss a batsman include catching a struck ball
before it touches the ground, and having the batsman adjudged LBW  Leg Before
Wicket . Once the batsmen are not attempting to score any more runs, the ball is
 dead  and is bowled again  each attempt at bowling the ball is a  ball  or a
 delivery  .

The game is divided into  [[over  cricket /overs]]  of six  legal  balls. At the
end of an over, the batting and bowling ends will be swapped, and the bowler
replaced by a member of the fielding side. The two umpires also change positions
at this time, and sometimes the fielding positions are rearranged.

Once out, a batsman is replaced by</STYLE>
