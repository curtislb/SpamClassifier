A  Friday  occurring on the  13th  day of any month is considered to be a day of
bad luck in English, German, Polish and Portuguese speaking cultures around the
globe. Similar superstitions exist in some other traditions. In Greece or Spain,
for example, Tuesday the 13th takes the same role. In Russia, the unlucky day is
Monday. The fear of Friday the 13th is called  paraskavedekatriaphobia   a word
that is derived from the concatenation of the Greek words                   ,
                  , and           , meaning Friday, thirteen, and phobia
respectively  alternate spellings include paraskevodekatriaphobia or
paraskevidekatriaphobia  or  friggatriskaidekaphobia , and is a specialized form
of triskaidekaphobia, a [[phobia]]  fear  of the number thirteen.

History of Friday the 13th


Many popular stories exist about the origin of the concept 
  The Last Supper, with stories that Judas was the thirteenth guest, and that
  the Crucifixion of Jesus occurred Friday.
  That the biblical Eve offered the fruit to Adam on a Friday, and that the
  slaying of Abel happened on a Friday  though the Bible does not identify the
  days of the week when these events occurred .  ref   ref 
  Many modern stories  including [[The Da Vinci Code]]  claim that when King
  Philip IV had many Knights Templar simultaneously arrested on Friday, October
  13, 1307, that started the legend of the unlucky Friday the 13th.

Neither these nor any other historical date have been verifiably identified as
the origin of the Friday the 13th superstition. The first documented mention of
a  Friday the 13th  is generally listed as occurring in the early
1900s. ref [http   www.snopes.com luck friday13.asp Snopes]  ref  ref [http   u 
rbanlegends.about.com cs historical a friday_the_13th_4.htm urban legends 
Friday the 13th]  ref   ref   ref 

In the case of Greece, Tuesday, April 13, 1204 was the date that Constantinople
was sacked by the crusaders of the Fourth Crusade. The first ever fall of what
was then the richest Christian city, and the looting that followed, allegedly
gave Tuesday 13 its bad meaning. Coincidentally, Constantinople fell for the
second time in its history on Tuesday, May 29, 1453, to the Ottoman Turks, a
date that puts an end to the Byzantine empire, and to Greek sovereignty for
several centuries, and therefore reinforcing Tuesday as an unlucky day in the
Greek world.

Effects in people and cultures
  It s been estimated that [U.S] $800 or $900 million is lost in business on
 this day because people will not fly or do business they would normally do.

 North Carolina  ref 
Some people are so paralyzed by fear that they are simply unable to get out of
bed when Friday the 13th rolls around. The Stress Management Center and Phobia
Institute estimates that more than 17 million people are affected by a fear of
this day.  ref   cite news /first   John /last   Roach /title   Friday the 13th

Delta and Continental Airlines say that their airlines don t suffer from any
noticeable drop in travel on those Fridays.  ref   ref 

A British Medical Journal study has shown that there is a significant increase
in traffic related accidents on Friday the 13ths. ref Scanlon TJ, Luben RN,

Journal, 1993  Issue 307 1584 6.  ref 

The date is well known in the motorcycle  biker  community  Since 1981,
motorcycle enthusiasts and vendors gather every Friday the 13th in Port Dover,
Ontario, Canada. This tradition started on November 13, 1981 by Chris Simons as
a gathering of approximately 25 friends. The event has grown substantially, with
an estimated 100,000 people attending in August 2004, as well as music bands,
vendors, a bike show, etc.
