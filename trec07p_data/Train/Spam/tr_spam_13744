The  kumquats  or  cumquats  are a group of small fruit bearing trees in the
subgenus Fortunella of the genus [[Citrus]] in the flowering plant family
Rutaceae, often segregated as a separate genus Fortunella. The edible fruit
 which is also called kumquat  closely resembles that of other Citrus but is
smaller.

They are slow growing, evergreen shrubs or small trees, from 2.5   4.5 m tall,
with dense branches, sometimes bearing small thorns. The leaves are dark glossy
green, and the flowers pure white, similar to citrus flowers, borne singly or
clustered in the leaf axils.

Kumquats originated in China  they are noted in literature dating to the 12th
century , and have long been cultivated there and in Japan. They were introduced
to Europe in 1846 by Robert Fortune, collector for the London Horticultural
Society, and shortly thereafter into North America. Originally placed in the
genus Citrus, they were transferred to the genus Fortunella in 1915, though
subsequent work  Burkill 1931, Mabberley 1998  favours their return to inclusion
in Citrus.

Four or five species are currently accepted   Citrus crassifolia  syn.

margarita, F. margarita    Marumi or Nagami Kumquat  Citrus obovata  syn.
Fortunella obovata    Jiangsu or Fukushu Kumquat  Citrus polyandra  syn.
Fortunella polyandra    Malayan Kumquat

Kumquats readily hybridise with other members of the genus Citrus and with the
closely related   Poncirus  . These hybrids are known as Citrofortunella 
examples include the limequat, orangequat, and calamondin.

In appearance the kumquat fruit  generally called simply  kumquat   resembles a
miniature oval orange, 3 5 cm long and 2 4 cm wide. Depending on variety, peel
color ranges from yellow to red. A Nagami kumquat has an oval shape, while a
Marumi kumquat is round.

Kumquat fruit is generally in season from late autumn to mid winter, and can be
found in most food markets with other produce.

Cultivation and uses Kumquats are cultivated in China, Taiwan, Southeast Asia,
Japan, Europe  notably Corfu, Greece , and the southern United States  notably
Florida .


Climate They are much hardier than citrus plants such as oranges. The  Nagami 
kumquat requires a hot summer, ranging from 25   C 77  F  to 38   C 100.4  F ,
but can withstand frost down to about  minus 10   C 14  F  without injury. It
grows in the tea regions of China where the climate is too cold for other citrus
fruits, even the Mikan  also known as the Satsuma  orange. The trees differ also
from other Citrus species in that they enter into a period of winter dormancy so
profound that they will remain through several weeks of subsequent warm weather
without putting out new shoots or blossoms. Despite their ability to survive low
temperatures, as in the vicinity of San Francisco, California, the kumquat trees
grow better and produce larger and sweeter fruits in warmer regions.

Propagation Kumquats are rarely grown from seed as they do not do well on their
own roots. In China and Japan they are grafted onto the trifoliate orange
 [[Poncirus trifoliata]] . This has been found the best rootstock for kumquats
in northern Florida and California and for dwarfing for pot culture. Sour orange
and grapefruit are suitable rootstocks for southern Florida. Rough lemon is
unsatisfactory in moist soils and tends to be too vigorous for the slow growing
kumquats.



Uses Kumquats are frequently eaten raw. As the rind is sweet and the juicy
center is sour, the raw fruit is usually consumed either whole, to savour the
contrast, or only the rind is eaten. The fruit is considered ripe when it
reaches a yellowish orange stage, and has just shed the last tint of green. A
variety of kumquat grown in Hong Kong has a rather sweet rind compared to the
rinds of other citrus fruits.

Culinary uses include  candying and kumquat preserves, marmalade, and jelly.
Kumquats appear more commonly in the modern market as a martini garnish,
replacing the classic olive. They can also be sliced and added to salads. A
liqueur can also be made by macerating kumquats in vodka or other clear spirit.

The Cantonese often preserve kumquats in salt. A batch of the fruit is buried in
dry salt inside a glass jar. Over time, all the juice from the fruit is
extracted through dehydration into the salt. The fruits in the jar become
shrunken, wrinkled, and dark brown in color, and the salt combines with the
juice to become a dark brown brine. A few salted kumquats with a few teaspoons
of the brine juice may be</STYLE>
