Beloved 

I am Agnes Samuel now undergoing medical treatment for  cancer now. I am married to Dr. George Samuel who worked with South Africa embassy in 
Malaysia for nine years before he died in the year 2000. well I will only try to let you know who Dr. George Samuel is by stating  his philosophy of life ."life is worth living only if lived to the service of mankind" and "You make a living by what you earn, but you make  life? by what you give?This will give you an insight of the spirit behind what I believe and what I will live for cause he is my mentor. 

Having known  my poor health condition I have decided to donate my fund to a church, better still a  Christian individual or a Moslem that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein. 
 

My Attorney will issue you a letter of authority that will empowers you as the original beneficiary of these funds.

Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein. 

In His Arms. 
Mrs. Agnes Samuel.
