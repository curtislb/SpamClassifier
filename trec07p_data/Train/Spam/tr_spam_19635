/ range_map_caption   The Emu has been recorded in the areas shown in black.
   The  Emu   IPA pronunciation   , Dromaius novaehollandiae, is the largest
bird native to Australia and the only extant member of the genus [[Dromaius]].
It is also the second largest extant bird in the world by height, after its
ratite relative, the ostrich. The soft feathered, brown, flightless birds reach
up to 2 m  6 ft 7 inches  in height. The Emu is common over most of mainland
Australia, although it avoids heavily populated areas, dense forest and arid
areas. Emus can travel great distances at a fast, economical trot and, if
necessary, can sprint at 50 km h  31 nbsp mph  for some distance at a time. ref
name    Davies  Davies, S. J. J. F. 1963. Emus. Australian Natural History
14 225   29  ref  They are opportunistically nomadic and may travel long
distances to find food  they feed on a variety of plants and insects.

The Emu subspecies that previously inhabited Tasmania became extinct following
the European settlement of Australia in 1788  the distribution of the mainland
subspecies has also been affected by human activities. Once common on the east
coast, Emu are now uncommon  by contrast, the development of agriculture and the
provision of water for stock in the interior of the continent have increased the
range of the Emu in arid regions. Emus are farmed for their meat, oil and
leather.

Taxonomy and distribution Three different [[Dromaius]] species were common in
Australia before European settlement, and one species is known from fossils. The
small emus nbsp     [[Kangaroo Island Emu/Dromaius baudinianus]] and [[King
Island Emu/D. ater]] nbsp     both became extinct shortly after  however, the
Emu, D. novaehollandiae, remains common. The population varies from decade to
decade, largely dependent on rainfall  it is estimated that the Emu population
is 625,000   725,000, with 100,000   200,000 in Western Australia and the
remainder mostly in New South Wales and Queensland. ref name    AM  Australian
Museum. 2001. [http   www.amonline.net.au birds factsheets emu.htm Emu Dromaius
novaehollandiae]  ref  D. novaehollandiae diemenensis, a subspecies known as the
Tasmanian Emu, became extinct around 1865. Emus were introduced in Maria Island
near Tasmania, and Kangaroo Island near South Australia, in the 20th century and
have established breeding populations there.

There are three extant subspecies in Australia 
  In the southeast, D. nbsp novaehollandiae novaehollandiae, with its whitish
  ruff when breeding 
  In the north, D. nbsp novaehollandiae woodwardi, slender and paler  and
  In the southwest, D. nbsp novaehollandiae rothschildi, darker, with no ruff
  during breeding.

The species was first described under the name of the New Holland Cassowary in
Arthur Phillip s Voyage to Botany Bay, published in 1789. ref name  
 Gould  Gould, J. 1865. Handbook to the Birds of Australia Volume 2. Reprinted
in 1972 by Landsdowne Press  ref  The species was named by ornithologist John
Latham, who collaborated on Phillip s book and provided the first descriptions
of and names for many Australian bird species  its name is Latin for  fast 
footed New Hollander . The etymology of the common name Emu is uncertain, but is
thought to have come from an Arabic word for large bird that was later used by
Portuguese explorers to describe the related Cassowary in New Guinea. ref name  
 AM     br 

Description arrangement  this adaptation for running is seen in other bird
species, such as bustards and quails. The Ostrich has only two toes]]

Emus are large birds. The largest individuals can reach up to two metres  6 ft 7
inches  in height  1   1.3 nbsp metres  3.2   4.3 nbsp ft  at the shoulder  and
weigh between 30 and 45 kilograms  66   100 pounds . ref name    AM     They
have small vestigial wings and a long neck and legs. Their ability to run at
high speeds is due to their highly specialised pelvic limb musculature. Their
feet have only three toes and a similarly reduced number of bones and associated
foot muscles  they are the only birds with gastrocnemius muscles in the back of
the lower legs. The pelvic limb muscles of Emus have a similar contribution to
total body mass as the flight muscles of flying birds. ref Patak, A. E. and
Baldwin, J. 1998 Pelvic limb musculature in the emu Dromaius novaehollandiae
 Aves   Struthioniformes   Dromaiidae   Adaptations to high speed running.
Journal of Morphology 238 23   37 PMID 9768501  ref 

Emus have brown to grey brown plumage of shaggy appearance  the shafts and the
tips of the feathers are black. Solar radiation is absorbed by the tips, and the
loose packed inner plumage insulates the skin. The resultant heat is prevented
from flowing to the skin by the insulation provided by the coat, ref Maloney, S.
K. and Dawson, T. J. 1995. The heat load from solar radiation on a large,
diurnally active bird, the emu  Dromaius novaehollandiae . Journal of Thermal
Biology 20 381   87  ref  allowing the bird to be active during the heat of the
day. A unique feature of the Emu feather is its double rachis emerging from a
single shaft. The sexes are similar in appearance.

On very hot days, Emus pant to maintain their body temperature, their lungs work
as evaporative coolers and, unlike some other species, the resulting low levels
of carbon dioxide in the blood do not appear to cause alkalosis. ref Maloney,
S.K and Dawson, T.J. 1994. Thermoregulation in a large bird, the Emu  Dromaius
novaehollandiae . Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology. B, Biochemical
Systemic and Environmental Physiology. 164 464   72   ref  For normal breathing
in cooler weather, they have large, multifolded nasal passages. Cool air warms
as it passes through into the lungs, extracting heat from the nasal region. On
exhalation, the Emu s cold nasal turbinates condense moisture back out of the
air and absorb it for reuse. ref </STYLE>
