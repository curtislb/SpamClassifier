 Wetumpka  is a city in Elmore County, Alabama, United States. At the 2000
census the population was 5,726. The city is the county seat of Elmore County,
the third fastest growing county in the state. Together with Montgomery,
Prattville, Millbrook, and Tallassee the city is considered part of the
Montgomery Metropolitain Area, or River Region, with a population of 346,578.
Wetumpka promotes itself with the nickname of  The City of Natural Beauty. 

Etymology The name  Wetumpka  is a Creek place word meaning  rumbling waters , a
description of sound of the nearby Coosa River as the water falls over the
rapids of the Devil s Staircase, which could be heard for miles before the
construction of dams. Wetumka, Oklahoma was named by Creeks after being forced
west to Oklahoma, then the Indian Territory, by the Indian Removal Act.

History of Wetumpka

Arrival of the French

The area around Wetumpka was the heart of the Upper Creek lands, whose largest
towns were located on the banks of the Tallapoosa and Coosa rivers at Wetumpka
and Tallassee. After settling Mobile in 1711, Jean Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de
Bienville sent an expedition up the Alabama River to establish a fort in the
interior of New France, both to stop the encroachment of the British and to
foster trade and goodwill with the Native Americans. In 1714 they constructed
Fort Toulouse after finding that the river was no longer navegable any farther
north. The French remained in Wetumpka until 1763, when the land passed to
Britain.

Jackson and the Creek War

After the departure of the French, the Creeks became allies of the British. The
conflict between the native Creeks and newly arriving American settlers came to
a head during the War of 1812, when the British began to incite the Creeks to
attack American settlers, most notoriously during the Fort Mims Massacre. The
United States government sent Andrew Jackson to quash the Creek uprising.
Jackson and his Tennesseans rebuilt the abandoned Fort Toulouse, which he
renamed Fort Jackson, and made the site his headquarters during the Creek War.
The Creek  Red Sticks , including local Creek chiefs Menawa and William
Weatherford were definitively defeated in 1814 at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend,
after which they were forced to sign the Treaty of Fort Jackson, which ceded to
the United States 23 million acres of Creek lands. After the war, many of
Jackson s Tennessee militia would return to the area with their families and
become among the first settlers of the region.

 The Most Promising City of the West  New settlers, primarily from Georgia and
Carolina, flooded into the fertile land that the Creeks had been forced to
abandon. With its strategic location at the conflux of three rivers, Wetumpka
rapidly became an important center of agricultural trade. The city was formally
incorporated in 1834. Cotton became the lifeblood of the new state of Alabama.
>From the scattered fields and large farms of the interior, it was carted
overland to Wetumpka, where boats, not being able to travel any further north
over the Devil s Staircase, were loaded with cotton bales and sent back
downriver to Mobile to be sold.

Wetumpka became a cotton made boom town. The new city was divided in half. The
part of the city on the eastern bank of the river was commercial, with banks,
stores, and hotels, and was located in Coosa County. The western section, in
Autauga County was residential, with houses and churches laid out in an
organized grid pattern.

By 1836, the city s population had grown to 1,200. A New York newspaper declared
that  Wetumpka, Alabama and Chicago, Illinois are the most promising two cities
of the West.  The city commissioned its own steamboat, The Coosa Belle, to ferry
passengers and cotton between Wetumpka and Mobile.

Montgomery s Clever Coup The same forces fueling Wetumpka s growth were shifting
the balance of power within Alabama. A standoff between the farmers of the
Tennessee Valley, centered in the former capital of Huntsville, and the old
mercantile wealth of Mobile, had resulted in the capital being for many years at
Tuscaloosa. By 1845, however, the cotton growers in the Black Belt had become
some of the wealthiest in the country, and power was shifting towards the
southern and central parts of the state. Black Belt plantation owners and the
Mobilians wanted the capital moved. The necessity for compromise pointed towards
a new, centrally located capital, on the river and easily accessible by
steamboat. The lead contenders were Wetumpka and the newer city of Montgomery, a
few miles south. It appeared that neither city had a majority of support in the
state, as representatives from north Alabama, enraged that the capital was being
taken from Tuscaloosa, were indifferent as to which site would be chosen. Just
before the election, the citizens of Montgomery managed to lure an expensive
French chef to the new hotel they had built that would house the state s
representatives while they were in session if Montgomery were selected. Elegant
