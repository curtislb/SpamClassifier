do this at extremely rates of speed. In short, the rapidly changing and
novel the environment, more information the needs to process order to make
effective, rational decisions. Yet just there are limits on how sensory
input we can accept, there are constraints on our ability to process
information. the words of psychologist George Miller of Rockefeller there
are "severe limitations on amount of information that we are 
to receive, process, and remember." By information, by abstracting and it
in various we manage to stretch limits, yet ample evidence that our
capabilities are finite. To discover outer limits, psychologists
communications theorists have set about testing they call the "channel
capacity" of the organism. For the purpose these experiments, they regard
man as "channel." Information enters the outside. It processed. It exits in
the

processing can measured by comparing the of information input with the and
accuracy of has been defined technically measured in terms of called "bits."
(A bit the amount of information needed make decision between two 
likely alternatives. The number of bits needed by one as number of such
alternatives doubles.)‡By now, experiments established rates for the
processing involved in wide variety of tasks from typing, and playing the to
manipulating dials or doing mental arithmetic. while researchers differ as
to the figures, they strongly agree two basic principles: first, man has
limited capacity; and that overloading the system leads serious breakdown of
