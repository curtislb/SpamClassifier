<P>Good day,<BR>&nbsp;<BR>I am John Judge, a staff of ADAM &amp; COMPANY I
am contacting you <BR>independently of my investigation and no one is
informed of <BR>this communication. I would like to intimate you with
certain <BR>facts that I believed would be of interest to you.I Would
<BR>respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail
<BR>confidential and respect the integrity of the information you <BR>come
by as a result of this mail.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I am contacting you in respect of $10.5 Million USD deposited <BR>with
our private bank whose original depositor died in mid <BR>2002,According to
practice, The bank will by the end of its <BR>financial year broadcast a
request for statements of <BR>claims,failing to receive viable claims they
will probably <BR>revert the deposit back to ADAM &amp; COMPANY.This will
result in <BR>the money entering the ADAM &amp; COMPANY accounting
system,This <BR>will not happen if I have my way, the world of private
banking <BR>especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy
<BR>certain offices and oversee certain portfolios.As a matter of
<BR>fact,In line with our internal processes for account holders <BR>who
have passed away,we instituted our own investigations in <BR>good fate to
determine who should have right to claim the <BR>estate. This investigation
has for the past years been <BR>unfruitful. We have scanned every continent
and used our <BR>private investigation affiliate companies to get to the
root <BR>of the problem. It is this investigation that resulted in my
<BR>being furnished with your details as a possible relative of <BR>the
deceased.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<P>My present official capacity as the Head of private banking <BR>sector
dictates that I am the only party to supervise the <BR>investigation and the
only party to receive the results of the <BR>investigation,leaves me as the
only person with the full <BR>picture of what the prevailing situation is in
relation to the <BR>deposit and the beneficiary of the deposit. </P>
<P><BR>My proposal:I am prepared to place you in a position to <BR>initiate
the release of the deposit to you as the closest <BR>surviving relation,Upon
successful delivery of the deposit to <BR>you,I am prepared to share the
money with you. That is: I will <BR>simply norminate you as the next of kin
and have them release <BR>the deposit to you. We share the proceeds 50/50
%.The <BR>alternative would be for us to have The bank ADAM &amp; COMPANY
<BR>direct the funds to another bank with you as account holder. <BR>This
way there will be no need for you to think of receiving <BR>the money from
The bank. We can fine-tune this based on our <BR>interactions am aware of
the consequences of this proposal. I <BR>ask that if you find no interest in
this project that you <BR>should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be
vindictive <BR>and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete
<BR>this message and forget I ever contacted you.</P>
<P><BR>My present official capacity as the Head of private banking
<BR>sector I assure you that I could have the deposit released to <BR>you
within few days. I&nbsp; shall validate the claim, make a <BR>customary
writing report that you are the Beneficiary.This <BR>report will validate
the bonafide of your claim and confirm <BR>you as the beneficiary and
therefore entitled to an allocation <BR>of Control Approval code for the
release of the deposit by the <BR>bank .once i validate the claim, the bank
is bound to approve <BR>same, this is why i have an unflinching confidence
in the <BR>safety of our arrangement.The transaction will be 100% legal.
<BR>From the foregoing, you are therefore able to appreciate why i <BR>have
hammered on the absolute necessity of our maintenance of <BR>confidentiality
of the project and the transfer even after we <BR>have disbursed the money
after arrival in your position.</P>
<P><BR>I am not a criminal and what I do, I do not find against good
<BR>conscience,this may be hard for you to understand, but the <BR>dynamics
of my industry dictates that I make this move. Such <BR>opportunities only
come ones' way once in a lifetime. I cannot <BR>let this chance pass me by,I
am a family man and this is an <BR>opportunity to provide them with new
opportunities.There is a <BR>reward for this project and it is a task well
worth <BR>undertaking. I have evaluated the risk and the only risk I
<BR>have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my <BR>bank.
I am the only one who knows of this situation,If you <BR>find yourself able
to work with me, contact me through this <BR>email account. If you give me
positive signals, I will <BR>initiate this process towards a conclusion. I
wish to inform <BR>you that should you contact me via official channels; I
will <BR>deny knowing you and about this project. <BR>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I repeat, I do not want you contacting me through my official <BR>phone
lines nor do I want you contacting me through my <BR>official email account.
Contact me only through the numbers I <BR>will provide for you and also
through this email address. I do <BR>not want any direct link between you
and myself. My official <BR>lines are not secured lines as they are
periodically monitored <BR>to access our level of customer care in line with
our Total <BR>Quality Management Policy.Please observe this instruction
<BR>religiously.</P>

co-operation.</P>
