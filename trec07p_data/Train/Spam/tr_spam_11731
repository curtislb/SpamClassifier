 Oxford  is a city and local government district in Oxfordshire, England, with a
population of 134,248  2001 census . It is home to the University of Oxford, the
oldest university in the English speaking world.

It is known as the  city of dreaming spires , a term coined by Matthew Arnold in
reference to the harmonious architecture of the university buildings. The River
Thames runs through Oxford, where for a distance of some 10 miles it is known as
the Isis.

The Oxford suburb of Cowley has a long history of carmaking and now produces the
BMW MINI.

History Oxford was first occupied in Saxon times, and was initially known as
 Oxenaforda . ref name  oxford   Oxford in fact owes its name and perhaps its
origin to its position at a major crossing point of the Thames   a ford suitable
for oxen.   The Bodleian Library [1982  ed.]  Town and Gown, page 9   ref  It
began with the foundations of St Frideswide s nunnery in the 8th century, and
was first mentioned in written records in the Anglo Saxon Chronicle for the year
912. In the 10th century Oxford became an important military frontier town
between the kingdoms of Mercia and Wessex and was on several occasions raided by
Danes. St Frideswide is the patron saint of both the city and university.

The prestige of Oxford is seen in the fact that it received a charter from King
Henry II, granting its citizens the same privileges and exemptions as those
enjoyed by the capital of the kingdom  and various important religious houses
were founded in or near the city. A grandson of King John established Rewley
Abbey for the Cistercian Order  and friars of various orders  Dominicans,
Franciscans, Carmelites, Augustinians, and Trinitarians , all had houses at
Oxford of varying importance. Parliaments were often held in the city during the
thirteenth century, but this period also saw the beginning of the long struggle
between the town and the growing university which ended in the subjugation of
the former, and the extinction for centuries of the civic importance of Oxford.

The University of Oxford is first mentioned in 12th century records. Oxford s
earliest colleges were University College  1249 , Balliol  1263  and Merton
 1264 . These colleges were established at a time when Europeans were starting
to translate the writings of Greek philosophers. These writings challenged
European ideology     inspiring scientific discoveries and advancements in the
arts     as society began seeing itself in a new way. These colleges at Oxford
were supported by the Church in hopes to reconcile Greek Philosophy and
Christian Theology.

Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford is unique as a college chapel and cathedral in
one foundation. Originally the Priory Church of St Frideswide, the building was
extended and incorporated into the structure of the Cardinal s College shortly
before its refounding as Christ Church in 1546, since which time it has
functioned as the cathedral of the Diocese of Oxford.
