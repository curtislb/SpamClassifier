 Arthur Neville Chamberlain   18 March 1869  ndash  9 November 1940 , known as
 Neville Chamberlain , was a British Conservative politician and Prime Minister
of the United Kingdom from 1937 to 1940.

Chamberlain is perhaps the most ill regarded British Prime Minister of the 20th
century in the popular mind internationally, because of his policy of
appeasement towards Nazi Germany regarding the abandonment of Czechoslovakia to
Hitler at Munich in 1938. In the same year he also gave up the Irish Free State
Royal Navy ports, in practice making it safe for German submarines to stay about
200 miles west of the Irish coast out of range of the Royal Navy, where they
could pick off merchant shipping at will.

After working in business and local government, and a short spell as Director of
National Service in 1916 and 1917, Chamberlain followed his father and older half 
brother in becoming a Member of Parliament in the 1918 general election at the
age of 49. He declined a junior ministerial position, remaining a backbencher
until he was appointed Postmaster General after the 1922 general election. He
was rapidly promoted in 1923 to Minister of Health and then Chancellor of the
Exchequer, but presented no budget before the government fell in 1924.

He returned as Minister of Health, introducing a range of reform measures from
1924 to 1929. He was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer in the coalition
National Government in 1931, and spent six years reducing the war debt and the
tax burden. When Stanley Baldwin retired after the abdication of Edward VIII and
the Coronation of George VI, Chamberlain took his place as Prime Minister in
1937.

Chamberlain s political legacy is overshadowed by his dealings with and
appeasement of Nazi Germany. He signed the Munich Agreement with Adolf Hitler in
1938, which effectively allowed Germany to annex the Czech Sudetenland. Shortly
thereafter, Hitler occupied the remainder of Czechoslovakia, technically his
first International aggression, and the first step on the road to World War II.
Chamberlain entered into a Mutual Defence Pact with Poland, but was unable to do
anything directly when Germany invaded it six days later on 1st September 1939.
Nevertheless, Chamberlain delivered an ultimatum to Hitler, declared war on
Germany on 3 September and launched attacks on German shipping on September 4.
During the period now known as  The Phony War  until May 1940 Chamberlain sent a
300,000 strong British Expeditionary Force to Belgium.  This force was lightly
armed and later had to be ignominiously rescued from the beaches of Dunkirk .

Chamberlain was forced to resign the premiership on 10 May 1940, after Germany
invaded the Netherlands, Belgium and France. He was succeeded by Winston
Churchill but remained very well regarded in Parliament. He had a key role in
the formation of the Special Operations Executive. Chamberlain died of cancer
six months after leaving office.

Early life , father of Neville.]]

Chamberlain was born in South Bourne, Egbaston, Birmingham, England. He was the
eldest son of the second marriage of Joseph Chamberlain, Lord Mayor of
Birmingham, and a half brother to Austen, later Sir Austen. Joseph s first wife
had died shortly after giving birth to Austen  Neville s mother also died in
childbirth in 1875, when Neville was six years old. The Chamberlain children
found their relations with their father strained, and Neville grew up developing
strong bonds with those siblings who were closest to him in age, most notably
his sisters Ida and Hilda, to whom he wrote every week while away from them.
Neville Chamberlain was a cousin of actor Alan Napier.

Chamberlain was educated at Rugby School, but the experience unsettled him and
he became rather shy and withdrawn during his time there. At first he declined
to join the school debating society, changing his mind only in 1886 when he
spoke in favour of preserving the United Kingdom, agreeing with his Liberal
Unionist father s opposition over Irish Home Rule. It was during this period
that Chamberlain developed a love of botany, and he later became a fellow of the
Royal Horticultural Society. He was also fascinated by Ornithology and fishing.
Chamberlain had a passion for music and literature, and in later life would
often quote William Shakespeare in the public debates of the day.

, Neville s half brother]]

After leaving school, Chamberlain became a day attender at Mason Science College
 later the University of Birmingham , as one of only three Prime Ministers to
attend a university or college other than Oxford or Cambridge  the others being
Lord John Russell, who attended Edinburgh, and John Stuar</STYLE>
