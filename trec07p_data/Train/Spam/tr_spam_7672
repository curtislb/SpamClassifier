 Hobart  is the state capital and most populous city of the Australian island
state of Tasmania. Founded in 1804 as a penal colony, it is Australia s second
oldest and eleventh largest city, with a metropolitan population of
approximately 202,000. The city is the financial and administrative heart of
Tasmania, and also serves as the home port for both Australian and French
Antarctic operations. from Constitution Dock]]

History



The first settlement was started in 1803 as a penal colony at Risdon Cove on the
eastern shores of the Derwent River, amid British concerns over the presence of
French explorers. In 1804 it was moved to a better location at the present site
of Hobart at Sullivan s Cove. The city, initially known as  Hobart Town  or
 Hobarton , was named after Lord Hobart the Colonial Secretary. The area s
original inhabitants were members of the semi nomadic Mouheneer tribe. A series
of bloody encounters with the Europeans and the effects of diseases brought by
the settlers forced away the aboriginal population, which was rapidly replaced
by free settlers and the convict population.

Charles Darwin visited Hobart Town in February, 1836 as part of the Beagle
expedition. He writes of Hobart and the Derwent estuary in his Voyage of the
Beagle   blockquote ...The lower parts of the hills which skirt the bay are
cleared  and the bright yellow fields of corn, and dark green ones of potatoes,
appear very luxuriant... I was chiefly struck with the comparative fewness of
the large houses, either built or building. Hobart Town, from the census of
1835, contained 13,826 inhabitants, and the whole of Tasmania
36,505.  blockquote 

But since the Derwent River was one of Australia s finest deepwater ports and
was the centre of the Southern Ocean whaling and seal trade, it rapidly grew
into a major port, with allied industries such as ship building. Hobart Town
became a city in 1842, and was renamed Hobart in 1875.       history needed
here, including penal colony, seal and whalers, postwar economic decline     


Geography

Hobart is located on the estuary of the Derwent River in the state s south east
at . The central business district is located on the western shore, adjacent to
Sullivan s Cove, with the inner suburbs spread out along the shores of the
Derwent and climbing up the hills at the foot of Mount Wellington  1270 metres .
The Port of Hobart occupies the whole of the original Sullivan s Cove.

The Greater Hobart Metropolitan area consists of three self governing cities,
City of Hobart, City of Glenorchy and City of Clarence, plus the urbanised areas
of the Municipality of Kingborough and Municipality of Brighton. The suburban
areas cover a significant amount of both the western and eastern sides of the
river. Apart from the city, the main commercial centres are Glenorchy  the
northern suburbs  and Rosny Park  the eastern shore . The satellite town
Kingston, south of the city, is fast becoming an outlying suburb of Hobart.
Other surrounding towns such as Sorell, Margate, Brighton and New Norfolk are
popular residential areas for commuters.
