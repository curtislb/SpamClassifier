other Boniface    Pope Boniface VIII   c. 1235  ndash  October 11, 1303 , born
 Benedetto Caetani , was Pope of the Roman Catholic Church from 1294 to 1303.
Biography Boniface VIII was born in 1235, Anagni as  Benedetto Caetani .

He was elected in 1294 after Pope Celestine V abdicated. There is a legend that
it was Boniface VIII s doing that Celestine V renounced the papacy   for
Boniface, previously Benedetto, convinced Celestine V that no person on the
earth could go through life without sin. However, in later times, it is a more
common understanding that Celestine V resigned by his own designs and Benedetto
merely showed that it was allowed by Church law. Either way, Celestine V left
and Boniface VIII took his place as pope. Before this, Boniface VIII was a
cardinal priest and papal legate to Sicily, France, and England. One of his
first acts as pontiff was to imprison his predecessor in the Castle of Fumone in
Ferentino, where he died at the age of 81, attended by two monks of his order.
In 1300, Boniface VIII formalized the jubilees, which afterwards became a source
of both profit and scandal to the church. Boniface VIII founded the University
of Rome La Sapienza in 1303. was in love with elenor of aquaminte.

Boniface VIII put forward some of the strongest claims to temporal, as well as
spiritual, supremacy of any Pope and constantly involved himself with foreign
affairs. In his Bull of 1302, [[Unam Sanctam]], Boniface VIII proclaimed that it
 is absolutely necessary for salvation that every human creature be subject to
the Roman pontiff , pushing papal supremacy to its historical extreme. These
views and his intervention in  temporal  affairs led to many bitter quarrels
with the Emperor Albert I of Hapsburg  1291 ndash 98 , the powerful family of
the Colonnas and with Philip IV of France  1285 ndash 1314 .

Conflicts with Philip IV

The conflict between Boniface VIII and Philip IV of France came at a time of
expanding nation states and the desire for the consolidation of power by the
increasingly powerful monarchs. With the clergy beginning to be taxed in France
and England, Boniface took a hard stand against it. He saw the taxation as an
assault on traditional clerical rights, and ordered the Bull [[Clericis
laicos]], forbidding lay taxation of the clergy without prior papal approval.
Philip retaliated against the bull by denying the exportation of money from
France to Rome, funds that the church required to operate. Boniface had no
choice but to quickly meet the demands of Philip by allowing taxation only
 during an emergency. 

After complications involving the capture of a celebrated French bishop by
Philip, the conflict was re ignited. In December of 1301, Philip was sent the
Papal Bull [[Ausculta fili]]   Listen, My Son  , informing Philip that  God has
set popes over kings and kingdoms. 

The feud between the two reached its peak in the early 14th century when Philip
began to launch a strong anti papal campaign against Boniface. On November 18,
1302, Boniface issued one of the most important papal bulls of Catholic History 
Unam Sanctum. It declared that both spiritual and temporal power were under the
pope s jurisdiction, and that kings were subordinate to the power of the church.

In response, Guillaume de Nogaret, Philip s chief minister, denounced Boniface
as a heretical criminal to the French clergy. In 1303, Philip and Nogaret were
excommunicated. However, an army led by Nogaret and Sciarra Colonna of the
Colonna family surprised Boniface at his retreat in Anagni. The King and the
Colonnas demanded that he resign, to which Boniface VIII responded that he would
 sooner die . Boniface was beaten badly and nearly executed but was released
from captivity after three days. He died a month later, on October 11, 1303.

After the humiliating ordeal of Boniface and Philip, no popes would ever again
challenge or seriously threaten kings and emperors despite further
excommunications and interdictions. In the future, the church would see itself
becoming subordinate to the growing power of the European nation states and
their secular leaders, and the church s secular power would forever be lost. It
is also interesting to note that this was the first event that marked the
downfall of the the church s prestige, and the decline of its prestige and
advertisement of its corruptions led to the Reformation.

Boniface VIII was buried in St. Peter s Basilica in a grandiose tomb that he had
designed himself.  Allegedly, when the tomb cracked open three centuries after
his death  on October 9, 1605 , his body was revealed to be perfectly
incorrupt.
