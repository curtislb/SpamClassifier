There are frequent  reports of problems with interoperability and
feature shortcomings. How does this technique  compare to the XML Enc
stuff in Atom? If the "type" attribute is not provided, Atom Processors
MUST behave as though it were present with a value of "text". Atom also
has support for aggregated feeds, where entries from multiple different
feeds are combined, with pointers back to the feed they came from.
You can think of syndication like a radio broadcast telling other
