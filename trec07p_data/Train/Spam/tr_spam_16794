<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dear Memo,</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several years ago, I came across an incredible ki=
t that uses the same secret rituals and magical tools that kings, queens and=
 others &quot;in the know&quot; have used to activate positive influences in=
 their lives so they could attain wealth, health, power and most importantly=
...happiness.</P></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD width=3D654 colSpan=3D2><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call this marvelou=
s collection of magical tools the "Road to Riches Kit," and I truly believe =
it would be in your best interest during this time to have and use it. 

							<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upcoming weeks can have a huge impact on suc=
cess and having one of these wonderful kits could just be the key you need.&=
nbsp;</P>
							<P align=3Dcenter><B>Here's what concerns me...</B> </P>
							<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's very unusual, but every now and then I'll b=
e doing a reading for someone when suddenly I get the strangest feeling...al=
most like a shock of electricity...and I know right away, that even though t=
he person's life is about to take a major turn for the better, there's a cha=
nce that they won't know how to get the most out of all the astounding good =
fortune headed their way.<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when I got this exact=
 feeling tonight, as I was working on the <B><U>Forecast For Health, Wealth =
and Happiness</U></B>, I said to myself, "you better drop everything and sha=
re your concerns with Memo."=20
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now before I get into the details of what this "f=
eeling" means, please understand I can't say precisely how it might play out=
 in your life. Different cosmic forces present different challenges to each =
individual.&nbsp;=20
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, judging from past experience, my best guess is=
, since your good fortune is so strong, if we take some prudent precautions =
right now absolutely nothing will go wrong.=20
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why I decided to write today to tell you all ab=
out the Cycle of Good Fortune and how you can best take advantage of it. Tha=
t's the least I could do, considering this period could change your life.<BR=

<TD width=3D500><B>What I found out...</B>
							<P>The good news is that the stars show me there is a current of posi=

any negative influences. I'm sure you know that there is always a certain am=
ount of negative vibrations in the environment. You don't want it blocking s=
ome of&nbsp;the benefits of the upcoming positive trends.<P>You can put an e=
nd to all those nagging problems that have been following you for so long.  =
I think these worries  affected a decision you made long ago, which is tied =
to an event that you cannot forget or let go of. (I believe this may be at t=
he bottom of recent emotional or health crises that could have affected your=
 relationships or work.)<BR>

I'm writing to you today. Nothing would make me feel better than to see you =

<P><B>2: An Elegant Prosperity-Affirming Pen </B>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing that always makes me feel prosperous is to ha=
