   , formerly known as  Ezo ,  Yezo ,  Yeso , or  Yesso , is the second largest
island and largest prefecture of Japan. The Tsugaru Strait separates it from
Honsh  , although it is connected to Honsh   by the underwater Seikan Tunnel.
The largest city on Hokkaid   is the prefectural capital, Sapporo.

History The Nihonshoki is often said to be the first mention of Hokkaid   in
recorded history. According to the text, Abe no Hirafu led a large navy and army
to northern areas from 658 to 660 and came into contact with the Mishihase and
Emishi. One of the places Hirafu went to was called Watarishima, which is often
believed to be present day Hokkaid  . However, many theories exist in relation
to the details of this event, including the location of Watarishima and the
common belief that the Emishi in Watarishima were the ancestors of the present 
day Ainu.

During the Nara and Heian periods, people in Hokkaid   conducted trade with Dewa
Province, an outpost of the Japanese central government. From the medieval ages,
the people in Hokkaid   began to be called Ezo. Around the same time Hokkaid  
came to be called Ezochi or Ezogashima. The Ezo mainly relied upon hunting and
fishing and obtained rice and iron through trade with the Japanese.

During the Muromachi period, the Japanese created a settlement at the south of
the Oshima peninsula. As more people moved to the settlement to avoid battles,
disputes arose between the Japanese and the Ainu. The disputes eventually
developed into a battle. Takeda Nobuhiro killed the Ainu leader and established
a Japanese victory. Nobuhiro s descendants became the rulers of the Matsumae
Han, which ruled the south of Ezochi until the end of the Edo period.

The Matsumae Han s economy relied upon trade with the Ainu. The Matsumae family
was granted exclusive trading rights with the Ainu in the Azuchi Momoyama and
Edo periods. The Han gradually changed trade conditions so they came to favor
Japanese merchants. As a result, some Ainu rebelled against the Matsumae han,
but the rebellions were defeated. During the Meiji Restoration, the Tokugawa
Shogunate realized there was a need to prepare northern defenses against Russian
aggressions and took over most control of Ezochi. The Shogunate made the Ainu
burden slightly easier, but did not change the overall form of rule.



Hokkaid   was known as Ezochi until the Meiji Restoration. Shortly after the
Boshin War in 1868, a group of Tokugawa loyalists led by Enomoto Takeaki
proclaimed the island s independence as the Republic of Ezo, but the rebellion
was crushed in May 1869. Ezochi was subsequently put under control of Hakodate 
Fu           , Hakodate Prefectural Government . When establishing the
Development Commission            , the Meiji Government decided to change the
name of Ezochi. Matsuura Takeshir   submitted 6 ideas, including names such as
Kaihokudo             and Hokkaid                  to the government. The
government eventually decided to use the name Hokkaid  , but decided to write it
as          , as a compromise between           and because of the similarity
with names such as T  kaid              . According to Matsuura, the name was
thought up because the Ainu called the region  Kai.  Historically, many peoples
who had interactions with the ancestors of the Ainu called them and their
islands Kuyi, Kuye, Qoy, or some similar name, which may have some connection to
the early modern form Kai. The Kai element also strongly resembles the Sino 
Japanese reading of the characters         Sino Japanese  ka i , Japanese
[[kun]]  emisi  , which have been used for over a thousand years in China and
Japan as the standard orthographic form to be used when referring to Ainu and
related peoples  it is possible that Matsuura s Kai was actually an alteration,
influenced by the Sino Japanese reading of        Ka i, of the Nivkh exonym for
the Ainu, namely Qoy. In 1882, the Development Commission was abolished, and
Hokkaid   was separated into three prefectures, Hakodate            , Sapporo
           , and Nemuro            . In 1886, the three prefectures were
abolished, and Hokkaid   was put under the Hokkaid   Agency               .
Hokkaid   became equal with other prefectures in 1947, when the revised Local
Autonomy Law became effective. The Japanese central government established the
Hokkaido Development Agency                      as an agency of the Prime
Minister s Office in 1949 to maintain its executive power in Hokkaido. The
Agency was absorbed by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport in
2001. The Hokkaido Bureau of the Ministry still has a strong influence on public
construction projects in Hokkaido.

Geography


Hokkaid   Island is located at the north end of Japan, near Russia, and has
coastlines on the Sea of Japan, the Sea of Okhotsk, and the Pacific Ocean. The
center of the island has a number of mountains and volcanic plateaus, and there
are coastal plains in all directions. Major cities include Sapporo and Asahikawa
in the central region and the port of Hakodate facing Honsh  .

The prefecture of Hokkaid   incorporates several smaller islands, including
Rishiri, Okushiri Island, and Rebun.  By Japanese reckoning, the prefecture also
incorporates several of the Kuril Islands.  Because the prefectural status of
Hokkaid   is denoted by the d   in its name, it is rarely referred to as
 Hokkaid   Prefecture,  except when necessary to distinguish the prefecture from
the island.

Seismic activity Like the rest of Japan, Hokkaid   is seismically active. Aside
from numerous earthquakes, the following volcanoes are still considered active
