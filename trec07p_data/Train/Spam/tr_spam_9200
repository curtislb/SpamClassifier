<P><FONT face=3D"Courier New" color=3Dblack size=3D2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week I want you to concentrate on the abundance=
 of blessings you have been given.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes for the better are here for you now, whic=
h is why I want you to be sensitive to the positive energy that is surroundi=
ng you. Feel the love, happiness, and joy that are reaching out to you.&nbsp=
; Take moments during your daily routine to stop and notice what is going on=
 &#150; see and feel the warm beautiful sunshine, or experience the quiet of=
 a gray, rainy day outside your window.&nbsp; Let the smile of a small child=
 touch your heart.&nbsp; Mentally send a blessing of love and abundance to e=
veryone you meet during your day.&nbsp; This is an especially important step=
 to do because whatever energy you give out to the world will be returned to=
 you.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I pointed out to you last week, you must be an=
 active and willing participant in this dance of Life. You must become invol=
ved by reaching out so you can reap the abundance the Universe is offering y=
ou now.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to harvest the fruits of your blessings,=
 be ready to move outside your comfort zone. You can't expect to fulfill you=
r dreams by sitting around watching television.&nbsp; Here is a mantra for y=
ou to use that can help you:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>I am capable of realizing my dreams</i>.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And remember to acknowledge your worth and love y=
ourself -- that's where it all begins. Keep working on the three steps we sp=
oke about last week and expect productive outcomes.&nbsp; With this mindset,=
 you will face your challenges and move forward with your goals and succeed.=

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are special, and you owe it to the world to b=
e all you can be.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As always, I am here for you.&nbsp; By the way, b=
e sure to read what Bethea says about this week's stars.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see that you have a chance to be in the spotlight =
in the near future, possibly related to something musical.  You could try yo=
ur hand at writing a song or entering a singing competition.
<BR>
<BR>





&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you been looking to add more fun to your life? =
 I advise you to listen to your dreams over the next few nights.  They may h=
ave a few ideas for you, spoken in their own colorful language.
<BR>
<BR>





&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it sometimes hard for you to turn off your though=
ts in order to sleep at night? This could be one of those times. Try meditat=
ive techniques and use soothing mental images to keep yourself on track.
