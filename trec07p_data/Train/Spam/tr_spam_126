 Agaoninae  Epichrysomallinae  Otitesellinae  Sycoecinae  Sycophaginae
 Sycoryctinae     Fig wasps  are wasps of the family  Agaonidae  which pollinate
figs or are otherwise associated with figs.

The family as presently defined is polyphyletic, including several unrelated
lineages whose similarities are based upon their shared association with figs 
efforts are underway to resolve the matter, and remove a number of constituent
groups to other families, particularly the Pteromalidae and Torymidae. Thus, the
number of genera in the family is in flux. Probably only the Agaoninae should be
regarded as belonging to the Agaonidae, whilst the Sycoecinae, Otitesellinae and
Sycoryctinae should be included in the Pteromalidae. Placement of the
Sycophaginae and Epichrysomallinae remains uncertain.

Among the Agaonidae, the female is a normal insect, while the males are mostly
wingless. The males  only tasks are to mate with the females while still within
the fig syconium and to chew a hole for the females to escape from the fig
interior. This is the reverse of Strepsiptera and the bagworm, where the male is
a normal insect and the female never leaves the host.

Most figs have three kinds of flowers  male, short female, and long female.
Female fig wasps can reach the ovaries of short female flowers with their
ovipositors, but not long female flowers. Thus the short flowers grow wasps,
whereas the long flowers become seeds. In figs of this sort, the crunchy bits in
the fruit contain both seeds and wasps. However, there are several commercial
and ornamental varieties of fig that are self fertile and do not require
pollination  these varieties are not visited by fig wasps.

Pollinating fig wasps  Agaoninae  are specific to specific figs. The common fig
Ficus carica is pollinated by [[Blastophaga]] psenes.

Life Cycle

The life cycle of the fig wasp is closely intertwined with that of the fig tree
they inhabit. The wasps that inhabit a particular tree can be loosely divided
into two groups  pollinating and non pollinating. The pollinating variety forms
a mutually beneficial symbiosis with the tree, whereas the non pollinating
variety is parasitic. Both life cycles, however, are very similar.

        Though the lives of individual species differ, a general fig wasp life
        cycle is as follows. In the beginning of the cycle, a mature female
        pollinator wasp lands on an unpollinated female fig flower. She deposits
        her eggs in the flower by oviposition during which she often loses her
        wings and most of her antennae. In depositing her eggs, the female also
        deposits pollen she picked up from her original host fig. This
        pollinates the fig and allows it to mature. After pollination, there are
        several species of non pollinating wasps which deposit their eggs before
        the figs harden. These wasps act as parasites to either the fig or the
        pollinating wasps. As the fig develops, the wasp eggs hatch and develop
        into larvae. Upon hatching, the male   s first act is to mate with a
        female. The males of many species lack wings and are unable to survive
        outside the fig for a sustained period of time. After mating, a male
        wasp begins to dig out of the fig, creating a tunnel for the females to
        escape through.

        Once out of the fig, the male wasps quickly die. The females leave the
        figs, picking up pollen as they do. They then fly to another tree of the
        same species where they deposit their eggs and allow the cycle to begin
        again.
