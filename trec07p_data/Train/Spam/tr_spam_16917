The  Savannah Sparrow   Passerculus sandwichensis  is a small sparrow. It is the
only member of the genus Passerculus  Bonaparte, 1838 . Recent comparison of
mtDNA NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 and 3 sequences  Zink et al., 2005  indicates
that the  Ipswich Sparrow , formerly usually considered a good species  as
Passerculus princeps , is a well marked subspecies of the Savannah Sparrow,
whereas the 2 southwestern subspecies should be recognized as distinct species.

This passerine bird breeds in Alaska, Canada, northern, central and Pacific
coastal USA, Mexico and Guatemala. The Pacific and Mexican breeders are
resident, but other populations are migratory, wintering from the southern
United States to northern South America. It is a very rare vagrant to western
Europe.

Savannah Sparrow is a very variable species, with numerous races, several of
which have been split as separate species at various times. The different forms
vary principally in the darkness of the plumage, with Alaskan and interior races
the palest, and southern Pacific coastal forms the darkest.

This species has a typically sparrow like dark streaked brown back, and whitish
underparts with brown or blackish breast and flank streaking. It has yellowish
or whitish crown and eyebrow stripes. The cheeks are brown and the throat white.

The breeding habitat is a wide variety of open habitats including grasslands and
cultivation. Savannah Sparrows nest on the ground, laying 3 6 eggs in a cup nest
sheltered by a clump of grass or other vegetation. They form flocks in the
winter to migrate.

These birds forage on the ground or in low bushes. They mainly eat seeds, but
insects are also eaten in the breeding season. The song is mixture of chips and
trills. The flight call is a thin seep.

This bird was named after Savannah, Georgia where one of the first specimens of
this bird was collected.

Although this bird is generally abundant across its range, some coastal
populations depending on salt marsh habitat are declining.

Fifteen subspecies plus the two Large billed Sparrows are currently recognized.
Four additional subspecies are not generally accepted. The subspecies are
usually divided into several groups 

  The Savannah Sparrows proper  migratory      P. s. labradorius, breeds in
  Newfoundland, Labrador, and N Quebec    P. s. oblitus, breeds in N Ontario and
  Manitoba    P. s. savanna   Eastern Savannah Sparrow  , breeds in the NE USA
  and adjacent Canada  includes P. s. mediogriseus     P. s. sandwichensis
    Aleutian Savannah Sparrow  , breeds on the Aleutian Islands and W Alaskan
  Peninsula    P. s. anthinus, breeds in the remainder of Alaska, south and east
  to central British Columbia and north of the Great Plains to Manitoba    P. s.
  brooksi   Dwarf Savannah Sparrow  , breeds in southernmost British Columbia to
  northernmost California    P. s. alaudinus, breeds in coastal northern and
  central California    P. s. nevadensis, breeds in the N Great Plains and the
  Great Basin    P. s. brunnescens, breeds from central Mexico south to
  Guatemala  includes P. s. rufofuscus 
P. s. wetmorei is a doubtful subspecies which may breed in the mountains of
   Guatemala. It is known from only 5 specimens, collected June 11 17, 1897, in
   Huehuetenango Department.

  The  Ipswich Sparrow   formerly considered a distinct species   see Zink et
  al., 2005  , some post breeding dispersal     P. s. princeps, breeds almost
  exclusively on Sable Island

  The Belding s Savannah Sparrows  resident      P. s. beldingi, resident on the
  Pacific Coast from Morro Bay, California, to El Rosario, Baja California
   includes P. s. bryanti     P. s. anulus, resident around Sebasti  n Vizca  no
  Bay, Baja California    P. s. guttatus, resident around San Ignacio Lagoon   
  P. s. magdalenae, resident around Magdalena Bay

  The  San Benito Savannah Sparrow   resident     P. s. sanctorum, Islas San
  Benitos

The Savannah Sparrows proper are very similar and migrant birds can not usually
be related to a breeding population with certainty. The resident or partially
migratory subspecies are well distinguishable by size and, particularly between
groups, coloration. The Ipswich Sparrow is somewhat larger and paler in colour
than other eastern Savannah Sparrows. The breast streaks are narrower and pale
brown. Some birds overwinter on the island  others migrate south along the
Atlantic coast, usually departing later and returning sooner than mainland
birds. Some birds interbreed with P. s. savanna in Nova Scotia. These birds
frequently raise three broods in a year. This bird was first observed in winter
on the dunes near the town of Ipswich, Massachusetts.

The  [[Large billed Sparrow]]s , best considered a distinct species  Zink et al,
2005 , are     Passercula rostratus rostratus  or P. s. rostratus , which breed
on the Gulf Coast of NE Baja California and NW Sonora  some post breeding
dispersal.    P. r. atratus  or P. s. atratus , resident on the coast of central
Sonora to central Sinaloa  resident
