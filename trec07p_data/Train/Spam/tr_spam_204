 s [[The Garden of Earthly Delights]].]]

 Utopia   from Greek        no, and           , place, i.e.  no place  or  place
that does not exist   is an imaginary island, depicted by Sir Thomas More as a
perfect social, legal, and political system. In a negative meaning it refers to
a society that is unrealistic and impossible to realize. It has also been used
to describe actual communities founded in attempts to create an ideal society.

Related terms   [[Dystopia]]  is a negative utopia  a totalitarian and
repressive world. Examples  George Orwell s [[Nineteen Eighty Four/1984]],
Aldous Huxley s [[Brave New World]], Alan Moore s [[V for Vendetta]], Margaret
Atwood s [[The Handmaid s Tale]] and Lois Lowry s [[The Giver]].   Eutopia  is a
positive utopia.   Outopia  derived from the Greek  ou  for  no  and   topos 
for  place   a perfect place  a fictional, non realistic place.   Heterotopia ,
the  other place , with its real and imagined possibilities  a mix of  utopian 
escapism and turning virtual possibilities into reality      example 
cyberspace. Samuel R. Delany s novel [[Trouble on Triton]] is subtitled An
Ambiguous Heterotopia to highlight that it is not strictly utopian  though not
dystopian . The novel offers several conflicting perspectives on the concept of
utopia.

More   Utopia  

 for the 1518 edition of Thomas More s Utopia]] St. Thomas More depicts a
 rationally organized society, through the narration of an explorer who
 discovers it   Raphael Hythlodaeus.

Utopia is largely based on Plato s [[Republic  Plato /Republic]]. It is a
perfect version of Republic wherein the beauties of society reign  eg  equalism
and a general pacifist attitude , although its citizens are all ready to fight
if need be. The evils of society, eg  poverty and misery, are all removed. It
has few laws, no lawyers and rarely sends its citizens to war, but hires
mercenaries from among its war prone neighbors  these mercenaries were
deliberately sent into dangerous situations in the hope that the more war like
populations of all surrounding countries will be weeded out, leaving peaceful
peoples . The society encourages tolerance of all religions, but not of atheism,
since the people believe that a man must fear some God, else he shall act evilly
and their society will weaken. Some readers have chosen to accept this imaginary
society as the realistic blueprint for a working nation, while others have
postulated More intended nothing of the like. Some maintain the position that
More s Utopia functions only on the level of a satire, a work intended to reveal
more about England than about an idealistic society. This interpretation is
bolstered by the title of the book and nation, and its apparent derivation from
the Greek for  no place  and  good place    Utopia  is a compound of the
syllable eu, meaning good, and topos, meaning place. But the homonymous prefix
ou, with the meaning  no,  also resonates in the word  the perfectly  good
place  is really  no place. 

Types of utopia Economic utopia These utopias are based on economics. Most of
them formed in response to the harsh economic conditions of the 19th century.
Particularly in the early nineteenth century, several utopian ideas arose, often
in response to the social disruption created by the development of commercialism
and capitalism. These are often grouped in a greater  utopian socialist 
movement, due to their shared characteristics  an egalitarian distribution of
goods, frequently with the total abolition of money, and citizens only doing
work which they enjoy and which is for the common good, leaving them with ample
time for the cultivation of the arts and sciences. One classic example of such a
utopia was Edward Bellamy s [[Looking Backward]]. Another socialist utopia is
William Morris  [[News from Nowhere]], written partially in response to the top 
down  bureaucratic  nature of Bellamy s utopia, which Morris criticized.
However, as the socialist movement developed it moved away from utopianism  Marx
in particular became a harsh critic of earlier socialisms he described as
utopian.  For more information see the History of Socialism article. 

Utopias have also been imagined by the opposite side of the political spectrum.
For example, Robert A. Heinlein s [[The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress]] portrays an
individualistic and libertarian utopia. Capitalist utopias of this sort are
generally based on perfect market economies, in which there is no market
failure mdash or the issue of market failure is never addressed, any more than
socialist utopias address the issue of planning failures. Also consider Eric
Frank Russell s book [[The Great Explosion]]  1963  whose last section details
an economic and social utopia. This forms the first mention of the idea of Local
Exchange Trading Systems  LETS .

Political and historical utopia Political utopias are ones in which the
government establishes a society that is striving toward perfection. With that
said, many such governments tend to be harsh in its execution of laws and allow
little individualism if it conflicts with its primary goals. Many strive for a
controlled society where the state or government replaces religious and family
values  and loyalties for that matter .

A global utopia of world peace is often seen as one of the possible inevitable
endings of history.

Sparta was a militaristic utopia founded by Lycurgus  though some, especially
Athenians, may have considered </STYLE>
