    Newfoundland and Labrador     is a province of Canada, the tenth to join the
Confederation. Geographically, the province consists of the island of
Newfoundland and the mainland Labrador, on Canada s Atlantic coast. On entry
into Canada in 1949, the entire province was known as  Newfoundland , but since
1964, the province s government has referred to itself as the  Government of
Newfoundland and Labrador , and on December 6, 2001, an amendment was made to
the Constitution of Canada to change the province s official name to
 Newfoundland and Labrador . In general day to day conversation, however,
Canadians still refer to the province in a general way as  Newfoundland,  while
the Labrador region of the province is usually referred to as simply Labrador.

While the name  Newfoundland  is derived from English as  New Found Land ,
Labrador is named after Portuguese explorer Jo  o Fernandes Lavrador.

The province s population is 505,469 according to the 2006 national census.

People from Newfoundland are called  Newfoundlanders   and at times  Newfies ,
though this can be seen as a pejorative  while people from Labrador are called
 Labradorians . Newfoundland has its own dialects of the English, French, and
Irish Gaelic languages. The English dialect in Labrador shares much with
Newfoundland. Furthermore, Labrador has its own dialects of Innu aimun and
Inuktitut.

Geography

As well as the long border on the mainland with Quebec on the Labrador
peninsula, the province has a short border with Nunavut on the small Killiniq
Island, ending at Cape Chidley. All islands off the northern coast of Quebec
belong to the territory of Nunavut.

Newfoundland also shares a territorial water border with France, with the
islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon.

History

Colony of Newfoundland Newfoundland has a number of historical firsts. The
oldest known settlement anywhere in The Americas built by Europeans is located
at L Anse aux Meadows, Newfoundland. It was founded circa 1000 A.D. by Leif
Ericson s Vikings. Remnants and artifacts of the occupation can still be seen at
L Anse aux Meadows, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The island was inhabited
by the Beothuks and later the Mi kmaq.

John Cabot became the first European since the Vikings to discover Newfoundland
 but see Jo  o Vaz Corte Real , landing at Bonavista on June 24, 1497. On August
5, 1583, Sir Humphrey Gilbert formally claimed Newfoundland as England s first
overseas colony under Royal Prerogative of Queen Elizabeth I.

>From 1610 to 1728, Proprietary Governors were appointed to establish colonial
settlements on the island. John Guy was governor of the first settlement at
Cuper s Cove. Other settlements were Bristol s Hope, Renews, South Falkland and
Avalon which became a province in 1623. The first governor given jurisdiction
over all of Newfoundland was Sir David Kirke in 1638. The island of Newfoundland
was nearly conquered by New France explorer Pierre Le Moyne d Iberville in the
1690s.

Newfoundland received a colonial assembly in 1832, which was and still is
referred to as the House of Assembly, after a fight led by reformers William
Carson, Patrick Morris and John Kent. The new government was unstable and
divided along sectarian lines between the Catholic and Protestant populations of
the colony. In 1842, the elected House of Assembly was amalgamated with the
appointed Legislative Council. This was changed back in 1848 to two separate
chambers. After this, a movement for responsible government began.

The Dominion of Newfoundland

]] In 1854, Newfoundland was granted responsible government by the British
government. In an 1855 election, Philip Francis Little, a native of Prince
Edward Island, won a majority over Sir Hugh Hoyle</STYLE>
