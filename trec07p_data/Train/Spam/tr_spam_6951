 Oxford  is a city and local government district in Oxfordshire, England, with a
population of 134,248  2001 census . It is home to the University of Oxford, the
oldest university in the English speaking world.

It is known as the  city of dreaming spires , a term coined by Matthew Arnold in
reference to the harmonious architecture of the university buildings. The River
Thames runs through Oxford, where for a distance of some 10 miles it is known as
the Isis.

The Oxford suburb of Cowley has a long history of carmaking and now produces the
BMW MINI.

History Oxford was first occupied in Saxon times, and was initially known as
 Oxenaforda . ref name  oxford   Oxford in fact owes its name and perhaps its
origin to its position at a major crossing point of the Thames   a ford suitable
for oxen.   The Bodleian Library [1982  ed.]  Town and Gown, page 9   ref  It
began with the foundations of St Frideswide s nunnery in the 8th century, and
was first mentioned in written records in the Anglo Saxon Chronicle for the year
912. In the 10th century Oxford became an important military frontier town
between the kingdoms of Mercia and Wessex and was on several occasions raided by
Danes. St Frideswide is the patron saint of both the city and university.

The prestige of Oxford is seen in the fact that it received a charter from King
Henry II, granting its citizens the same privileges and exemptions as those
enjoyed by the capital of the kingdom  and various important religious houses
were founded in or near the city. A grandson of King John established Rewley
Abbey for the Cistercian Order  and friars of various orders  Dominicans,
Franciscans, Carmelites, Augustinians, and Trinitarians , all had houses at
Oxford of varying importance. Parliaments were often held in the city during the
thirteenth century, but this period also saw the beginning of the long struggle
between the town and the growing university which ended in the subjugation of
the former, and the extinction for centuries of the civic importance of Oxford.

The University of Oxford is first mentioned in 12th century records. Oxford s
earliest colleges were University College  1249 , Balliol  1263  and Merton
 1264 . These colleges were established at a time when Europeans were starting
to translate the writings of Greek philosophers. These writings challenged
European ideology     inspiring scientific discoveries and advancements in the
arts     as society began seeing itself in a new way. These colleges at Oxford
were supported by the Church in hopes to reconcile Greek Philosophy and
Christian Theology.

Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford is unique as a college chapel and cathedral in
one foundation. Originally the Priory Church of St Frideswide, the building was
extended and incorporated into the structure of the Cardinal s College shortly
before its refounding as Christ Church in 1546, since which time it has
functioned as the cathedral of the Diocese of Oxford.

The relationship between  town and gown  has often been uneasy     as many as 93
students and townspeople were killed in the St Scholastica Day Riot of 1355.

During the English Civil War, Oxford housed the court of Charles I in 1642,
after the king was expelled from London, although there was strong support in
the town for the Parliamentarian cause. The town yielded to Parliamentarian
forces under General Fairfax in 1646. It later housed the court of Charles II
during the Great Plague of London in 1665 66. Although reluctant to do so, he
was forced to evacuate when the plague got too close.

In 1790 the Oxford Canal connected the city with Coventry. The Duke s Cut was
completed by the Duke of Marlborough in 1789 to link the new canal with the
River Thames  and in 1796 the Oxford Canal company built their own link to the
Thames, at Isis Lock. In the 1840s, the Great Western Railway and London and
North Western Railway linked Oxford with London.

In the 19th century, the controversy surrounding the Oxford Movement in the
Anglican Church drew attention to the city as a focus of theological thought.


Oxford s Town Hall was built by Henry T. Hare, the foundation stone was laid on
6 July 1893 and opened by the future King Edward VII on 12 May 1897. The site
has been the seat of local government since the Guild Hall of 1292 and though
Oxford is a city and a Lord Mayoralty, it is still called by its traditional
name of  Town Hall .

By the early 20th century, Oxford was experiencing rapid industrial and
population growth, with the printing and publishing industries becoming well
established by the 1920s. Also during that decade, the economy and society of
Oxford underwent a huge transformation as William Morris established the Morris
Motor Company to mass produce cars in Cowley, on the south eastern edge of the
city. By the early 1970s over 20,000 people worked in Cowley at the huge Morris
Motors and Pressed Steel Fisher plants. By this time Oxford was a city of two
halves  the university city to the west of Magdalen Bridge  from where students
traditionally jump into the River Cherwell every May Day morning  and the car
town to the east. This led to the witticism that  Oxford is the left bank of
Cowley . Cowley suffered major job losses in the 1980s and 1990s during the
decline of British L</STYLE>
