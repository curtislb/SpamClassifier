Privet, dear

You have got this letter from a woman who desires to find a second
half. It's me! I am confident and attractive, kind and joyful. Life
here is not the best!
I try to success in my job but it's impossible. It's hard to gain
success in anything here for a young woman. Men here are also not the
best in the world. I had bad experience in the past and I am not going
to repeat it!
What are you looking for in your life? Are you looking for a soulmate?
If yes, why not write me? See more about me here: http://myhearthwithlove.com/likes

Waiting for your response
Julia
