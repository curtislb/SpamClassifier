 Joseph Hilaire Pierre Ren   Belloc   July 27, 1870 ndash July 16, 1953  was one
of the most prolific writers in England during the early twentieth century.

Recent biographies of Belloc have been written by A. N. Wilson and Joseph
Pearce.

Life

Belloc was born in La Celle Saint Cloud France  next to Versailles and near
Paris  to a French father and English mother, and grew up in England.

His mother Elizabeth Rayner Parkes  1829 1925  was also a writer, and a great grand 
daughter of the English chemist Joseph Priestley. She married attorney Louis
Belloc in 1867. In 1872, five years after they wed, Louis died, but not before
being wiped out financially in a stock market crash. The young widow then
brought her son Hilaire, along with his sister, Mudle, back to England where he
remained, except for his voluntary enlistment as a young man in the French
artillery.

After being educated at John Henry Cardinal Newman s Oratory School Belloc
served his term of military service, as a French citizen, with an artillery
regiment near Toul in 1891. He was powerfully built, with great stamina, and
walked extensively in Britain and Europe. While courting his future wife Elodie,
whom he first met in 1890, the impecunious Belloc walked a good part of the way
from the midwest of the United States to her home in northern California, paying
for lodging at remote farm houses and ranches by sketching the owners and
reciting poetry. Hobbies When later he could afford it he was a well known
yachtsman as well as writer. Politics

An 1895 graduate of Balliol College, Oxford, Belloc was a noted figure within
the University, being President of the Oxford Union, the undergraduate debating
society. He went into politics after he became a naturalised British citizen. A
great disappointment in his life was his failure to gain a fellowship at All
Souls College in Oxford. This failure may have been caused in part by his
producing a small statue of the Virgin and placing it before him on the table
during the interview for the fellowship.

>From 1906 to 1910 he was a Liberal Party Member of Parliament for Salford South,
but swiftly became disillusioned with party politics. During one campaign speech
he was asked by a heckler if he was a  papist.  Retrieving his rosary from his
pocket he responded,  Sir, so far as possible I hear Mass each day and I go to
my knees and tell these beads each night. If that offends you, then I pray God
may spare me the indignity of representing you in Parliament.  The crowd cheered
and Belloc won the race.

Professional writer

Belloc wrote on myriad subjects, from warfare to poetry and many topics current
in his day. He was closely associated with G. K. Chesterton  George Bernard Shaw
coined the term  Chesterbelloc  for their partnership.

His only period of steady employment was from 1914 to 1920 as editor of [[Land
and Water]], a journal devoted to the progress of the war. Otherwise he lived by
his pen, and often felt short of money. He was brilliant, but a poor listener.
His larger than life personality, and strongly held views, were more acceptable
to some in small doses. His setbacks in the academic and political worlds lent
asperity to his writing.

Family

He was the brother of the novelist Mudle Adelaide Belloc Lowndes.

Belloc and his wife Elodie had five children before her 1911 death from
influenza, in their 17th year of marriage. He became estranged from Peter, one
of his sons, who was subsequently killed in action in World War I. He suffered a
stroke in 1941, and never recovered from its effects. He lived quietly at home
until his death in 1953. ref His estate was probated at   7,451.  ref  At his
funeral Mass, homilist Monsignor Ronald Knox observed,  No man of his time
fought so hard for the good things. 

  Old Thunder  

His style during later life complemented the nickname he received in childhood,
Old Thunder. Belloc s friend, Lord Sheffield, described his provocative
personality in a preface to The Cruise of the Nona.  ref Time and again I have
seen him throw out a sufficiently outrageous theory in order to stimulate his
company, and, be it said, for the pleasure of seeing how slowly he might be
dislodged from a position he had purposely taken up knowing it to be
untenable...Of course Belloc was prejudiced, but there were few who knew him who
did not love his prejudices, who did not love to hear him fight for them, and
who did not honor him for the sincerity and passion with which he held to them.
Once the battle was joined all his armoury was marshalled and flung into the
fray. Dialectic, Scorn, Quip, Epigram, Sarcasm, Historical Evidence, Massive
Argument, and Moral Teaching   of all these weapons he was a past master and
each was mobilised and made to play its proper part in the attack. Yet he was a
courteous and a chivalrous man. A deeply sensitive man, his was the kindest and
most understanding nature I have ever known. In spite of a rollicking and
bombastic side he was as incapable of the least cruelty as he was capable of the
most delicate sympathy with other people s feelings. As he himself used to say
of others in a curiously quiet and simple way,  He is a good man. He will go to
Heaven.    ref 

In Belloc s novel of travel, The Four Men, the title characters supposedly
represent different facets of the author s personality. One of the four
improvises a playful song at Christmastime, which includes the verse 
  May all good fellows that here agree
 Drink Audit Ale in heaven with me,  And may all my enemies go to hell   Noel 
Noel  Noel  Noel   May all my enemies go to hell   Noel  Noel   It should be
noted that the other characters regard the verse as fairly gauche and ill 
conceived, so while part of Belloc may have agreed with this somewhat offensive
song, it is not necessarily representative of </STYLE>
