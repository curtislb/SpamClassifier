     originally called Alectum   is the fourth largest city in Scotland, with a
population of 143,090. However, if outer districts such as Monifieth and
Invergowrie, joined physically but not politically, are counted, the number is
around 170,000. It is located on the north bank of the River Tay s estuary and
so is near the east coast and the North Sea. Dundee is known as the City of
Discovery, both in honour of Dundee s history of scientific activities, and of
the RRS   Discovery  , Robert Falcon Scott s Antarctic exploration vessel, which
was built in Dundee and is now berthed there.

Its history began with the Picts in the Iron Age and during the medieval period
was the site of many battles. During the Industrial Revolution the local jute
industry caused the city to grow rapidly. In this period Dundee also gained a
reputation for its marmalade industry and its journalism, giving Dundee its
epithet as the city of  jute, jam and journalism . Dundee s population reached a
peak of nearly 200,000 at the start of the 1970s, but it has since declined due
to outward migration and the council boundary changes of the 1970s and 1980s,
which saw Dundee lose suburbs to the surrounding counties.

The biomedical and technology industries have grown since the 1980s and the city
now accounts for 10  of Britain   s digital entertainment industry. Dundee
harbours two universities, namely the University of Dundee and the University of
Abertay Dundee. The city is home to the Scottish Dance Theatre, who are based in
the city s Dundee Repertory Theatre, and the Royal Scottish National Orchestra,
which regularly plays in the city s Caird Hall. On 5 March, 2004 Dundee was
granted Fairtrade City status. ref   cite press release

History

Dundee first became a settlement when the Picts settled the area 3,500 years
ago. At the time the area was known by the Pictish name of  Alec 
tum . ref   ref  The name  Dundee  was later adopted from the Gaelic D  n
D  agh, meaning  Fort of Fire . In 1191 CE, the town was awarded a charter
making it a royal burgh. ref name  Gazetteer    cite book

    ref  This charter was later revoked by Edward I, though it was replaced by a
new charter from Robert the Bruce in 1327. Dundee became a walled city in 1545,
owing to a period of hostilities known as the rough wooing. In July 1547, much
of the city was destroyed by an English naval bombardment. In 1645, during the
Wars of the Three Kingdoms, Dundee was again besieged, this time by the Royalist
Marquess of Montrose. ref name  Gazetteer     In 1651 during the Third English
Civil War, it was invaded by General Monck, who was the commander of Oliver
Cromwell s forces in Scotland. These English Parliamentarians destroyed much of
the city and killed many of its inhabitants. Dundee was later the site of an
early Jacobite uprising when John Graham, 1st Viscount Dundee raised the Stuart
standard on Dundee Law in support of James VII  James II of England  following
his overthrow, earning him the nickname Bonnie Dundee. ref   cite web
