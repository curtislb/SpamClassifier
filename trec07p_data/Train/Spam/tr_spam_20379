Hello,

Actaully there is a contract which I will like to introduce to you,
only if you are interested . 

This contract is on a product called AQUA-CHIPS,it is a product 
used in operating ship, its a navigating crystal product which directs 
the ship while in motion.Many ship here in UK have not been able to
 move out for work for some time due to scarcity and high cost of this
 product here.This particular product is produced in Brazil Australia, 
and just recently I got a contact where this AQUA-CHIPS is distributed
 in Malaysia at a cheap cost of 2050 Malaysian dollars per bottle,which
 is equivalent to GBP380 pounds,and you will be sell to the company at 
the price of 5,700 Malaysian dollars per bottle,equivalent to GBP840 pounds.
 It consist of 30 bottles in one carton. 

Each company that comes to Malysia for this product will buy at least 3 cartons.
My proposition is to present you as the supplier of this product to the engineers 
that will be coming from the shipping company here in UK to buy this product in
 Asia (Malaysia). I will be introducing you to the shipping company as the
 distributor of this product in Asia ,this contract will be continuous as long as you
 are capable enough to handle it properly. 

Immediately you signify your interest to execute this transaction, I intend to send
 you the scanned picture of the product and its function as it is in the ship. Kindly
 understand that as far as this contract is concerned,you will have to pose as the 
real distributor in Malaysia to the Engineers.Hence, I will advice that you buy the
 product out from the distributor there as we make all arrangement with the company here.
