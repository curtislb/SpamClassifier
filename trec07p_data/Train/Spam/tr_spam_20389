 Crochet   IPA  kr       e    is a process of creating fabric from yarn or
thread. The word is derived from the Middle French word croc or croche, meaning
hook. Crocheting, similar to knitting, consists of pulling loops of yarn through
other loops. Crochet differs from knitting in that only one loop is active at
one time  the sole exception being Tunisian crochet , and that a crochet hook is
used instead of two needles.

Origins Some theorize that crochet evolved from traditional practices in Arabia,
South America, or China, but there is no decisive evidence of the craft being
performed before its popularity in Europe during the 1800s. It is known that the
first printed crochet pattern appeared in a Dutch magazine in the early 1800s.
Many find it likely that crochet was in fact used by early cultures but that a
bent forefinger was used in place of a fashioned hook  therefore, there were no
artifacts left behind to attest to the practice. These writers point to the
 simplicity  of the technique and claim that it  must  have been early. lace,
late 19th Century]] Other writers point out that woven, knit and knotted
textiles survive from very early periods, but that there are no surviving
samples of crocheted fabric in any ethnological collection, or archeological
source prior to 1800. These writers point to the tambour hooks used in tambour
embroidery in France in the eighteenth century, and contend that the hooking of
loops through fine fabric in tambour work evolved into  crochet in the air. 
Most samples of early work claimed to be crochet turn out to actually be samples
of n  lebinding.

Beginning in the 1800s in Britain, America and France, crochet began to be used
as a less costly substitute for other forms of lace. The price of manufactured
cotton thread was dropping, and even though crocheted laces took up more thread
than woven bobbin laces, the crocheted laces were faster to make and easier to
teach.

During the Irish potato famine of 1846 to 1850, Ursuline nuns taught local women
and children to thread crochet. It was shipped all across Europe and America and
purchased for its beauty and also for the charitable help it provided for the
Irish population.

Hooks ranged from primitive bent needles in a cork handle, used by poor Irish
lace workers, to expensively crafted silver, brass, steel, ivory and bone hooks
set into a variety of handles, some of which were better designed to show off a
lady s hands than they were to work with thread. By the early 1840s,
instructions for crochet were being published in England, particularly by
Eleanor Riego de la Branchardiere and Frances Lambert. These early patterns
called for cotton and linen thread for lace, and wool yarn for clothing, often
in vivid color combinations.

Early history Around the world, crochet became a thriving cottage industry,
particularly in Ireland and northern France, supporting communities whose
traditional livelihoods had been damaged by wars, changes in farming and land
use, and crop failures. Women and sometimes even children would stay at home and
create things such as clothes and blankets to make money. The finished items
were purchased mainly by the emerging middle class. The introduction of crochet
as an imitation of a status symbol, rather than a unique craft in its own right,
had stigmatized the practice as common. Those who could afford lace made by
older and more expensive methods disdained crochet as a cheap copy. This
impression was partially mitigated by Queen Victoria, who conspicuously
purchased Irish made crochet lace and even learned to crochet herself. Irish
crochet lace was further promoted by Mlle. Riego de la Branchardiere around 1842
who published patterns and instructions for reproducing bobbin lace and needle
lace via crochet, along with many publications for making crocheted clothing
