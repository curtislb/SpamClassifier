CDPN Moves To Corners GPS Market In China!

China Datacom Corp.
Sym: CDPN
Close: $0.065

CDPN announced Friday that is has acquired all outstanding shares of
General Link Information Systems, Chinas only GPS vehicle monitoring and
management system. GPS systems are huge; controlling that market is even
bigger. Read the news and get on CDPN first thing Monday!

How to generate RPN bytecode from a procedural scripting language?
This is alive and well, a great example is Morgantaler giving a speech
at a UWO convocation.
anyone care to post a link?
1 2007-01-20 13:52 (Reply) At first the NVI pleased me very much because
it seperates the (overridable) implementation from the interface.
The integration itself was straight forward, but the real problem is,
that as soon as a collision is detected, the simulation gets out of
control.
I also packed another archieve containing all data sets that are used
for the demos - unfortunately you really need it in order to build the
framework and all examples using the build scripts. The Fuel offers some
standard 64bit PCI expansion slots, and even supports some standard PCI
cards. The more snapshots you have, the slower gets your system . ODE
seems to be especially sensitive to different masses, it turned out that
a proportional increase of all masses resulted in ignorance of all
collisions. Still this is not an ideal solution, it would be much better
to use motors in the first place to control the virtual object.
My implementation does not use the shunting yard algorithm, instead I
use a traditional recursive parser which directly can produce the RPN
bytecode. Much more pure virtual interface classes.
There are still many parts in Magnum that do not have such clean
interfaces.
You can leave a response, or trackback from your own blog.
The more snapshots you have, the slower gets your system .
A positive side-effect of bytecode is that simple fact that it is much
faster to execute than the original textual representation.
Now I have working a cheap but powerful gigabit ethernet card in my
Fuel, the same trick should also work on an Octane with a PCI card cage
and an Origin.
The more complex problem is the integration of the collision engine. The

) to make your classes accessible via reflection. But that would have
been another possibility.

For example one could write an XML template that generates serialisation
code for arbitrary classes (this actually shouldn't be too hard).
Finally google did not give me really good causes for using the
non-virtual interface pattern.

volume for all user directories on my Windows box. As you can see,
although I haven't updated Magnum for a while, I really have been busy
making it a better framework. XML parser and DOM-like document model.

How to interpret the final bytecode? These are just the reasons why a
home server makes sense for a lot of people today. 1 2007-01-20 13:52
(Reply) At first the NVI pleased me very much because it seperates the
(overridable) implementation from the interface. Out naive approach
simply repositions the user controlled body in each frame and hopes that
ODE will try to move the connected object body to the user body while
trying to obey to collisions.

As our collision engine does not offer the penetration depth, I have to
go down the second road and approximate the time of collision by
progressively subdividing timesteps in case of a collision. The same is
true with destructors. Dimajix Developer Blog What am I doing?

So what am I doing at the moment?
So I'd love to use ZFS together with OpenFiler - but ZFS currently is
only available in Solaris with a Linux port under the way.
Other possible uses include the generation of COM or .
