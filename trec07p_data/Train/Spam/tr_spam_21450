<P><BR>Dear Memo,</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a certain vibration I sometimes get -- a=
 tingling so strong, I call it "my psychic alarm clock."&nbsp; So when I got=
 it tonight, it literally made me bolt upright in bed.&nbsp; And with May 16=
th only days away, and a gold rush of good fortune on the cusp of spilling i=
nto your life, I knew I had to write you immediately.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't emphasize it enough, Memo, from the momen=
t I got your chart 4 weeks ago, I've felt that something special was going t=
o happen.&nbsp; But I also felt the potential for energies that could interf=
ere with all the luck and success that is coming soon.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, now I see more clearly where that blocking =
energy is coming from and what it's all about, and I want to show you how we=
 can head it off at the pass and keep it from getting in the way of your dre=
ams.</P>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>Life is too short, Memo, and I don't want you to waste =
a minute of yours without the joy, riches and charmed life you have every ri=
ght to expect.</B></P></TD></TR>
<TR height=3D41>
<TD vAlign=3Dtop align=3Dleft width=3D590 colSpan=3D2 height=3D41>
<P align=3Dleft>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I've told you before, you have am=
azing personal power.&nbsp; And this power of yours will help you to benefit=
 from the astounding cycle of good fortune that is just starting to roll int=
o your life.&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Importantly, as a Leo, one thing you must watch o=
ut for is your tendency to respond to flattery.  With the rewards and attent=
ion set to come your way, you want to be sure that the people around you are=
 truly trustworthy and not just hangers-on.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we first got acquainted, Memo, it has been =
my #1 priority to help you realize your greatest gifts and take advantage of=
 every opportunity for wealth and happiness. And because I've had your chart=
 since March 26th, 2007, I can now also see certain negative vibrations and =
how they could interfere with the joy and success that is your destiny.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, most importantly, I want to show you how you =
can easily counteract any and all difficulties that could be facing you and =
stay on track to take advantage of the unbelievable forces of good luck on t=
he verge of kicking in for you now.</P>
<P align=3Dleft>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>And because I want you to get the=
 most generous profit possible from your Cycle of Good Fortune, I want to gi=
ve you this FREE gift:</B></P>

<P align=3Dcenter><B>THE "GOLDEN PADLOCK" CHARM BRACELET<BR>...OPENS THE WAY=
 TO THE GREATEST DESTINY IN STORE FOR YOU, <BR>MEMO</B></P>
<P align=3Dleft>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This&nbsp;enchanting good luck charm=
 bracelet will help you connect with positive vibrations of power, love and =
riches that will come to a peak for you on May 16th.</P>
<P align=3Dleft>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as you get your "Golden Padl=
ock" charm bracelet, I want you to wear or carry it with you at all times to=
 maximize its energies of prosperity, happiness and good fortune.</P>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>Memo, as soon as your chart was done,<BR>I knew this wo=
uld be a year of dazzling luck for you.</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But recent developments made me realize that the =
energies favoring you would be even more supercharged than I expected.&nbsp;=
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And because the success that lies ahead for you w=
ill be greater than you ever dared dream, I want you to do yourself this sma=
ll favor:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Write down the date of this email and think about=
 who is around you at this time.&nbsp; In nine months from now, come back an=
d read what you wrote. I'll bet you the Moon that you, your life, and everyo=
ne in it will be so bright, shiny and completely re-energized, the differenc=
e will take your breath away.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why is this: Memo, since I first got y=
our chart, I knew something about you was truly unique and special...that yo=
ur gifts and potentials meant you were destined for greatness.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I always keep an eye out for chances =
for you to use your incredible inner powers to realize your special destiny,=
 and I also look out for any negative energies that might come between you a=
nd your dreams.</P>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>What was in my vision for you, and<BR>how you can benef=
it from it</B>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, last night, when my psychic alarm clock alert=
ed me, I became aware of <U>forces that could spell the difference between y=
our having the charmed life you deserve</U> or the disappointment of missed =
opportunities and frustrated ambitions.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I woke up, my heart was pounding so hard, I =
thought it would come right out of my chest.&nbsp; So I took a moment to col=
lect myself, like I always do when I get these signals.&nbsp; I had to breat=
he in and out slowly and focus in on what these intense energies were trying=
 to tell me.&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may have explained before that when these visio=
ns come to me, it's like dreaming with my eyes wide open, and I can see the =
outcomes of events and potentials.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may think this all sounds crazy, <U>but I ask=
 only that you have an open mind</U> as I tell you the psychic messages that=
 came to me.&nbsp; I am sure...especially if you take the advice I will give=
 you in this letter...you will see that my vision makes sense and fits the e=
vents currently developing in your life.</P>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>I believe these visions are psychic clues<BR>to your de=
stiny, Memo.</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My psychic visions are like portals that allow me=
 to see into the past and future. Sometimes they are symbolic; sometimes the=
y hit the nail on the head.&nbsp; That is why I always like hearing back fro=
m you when I provide readings in letters and your forecast.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is my first vision:&nbsp;</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>I see a shiny white limousine pulling=
 up to a grand entrance to a five-star hotel.&nbsp; At the curb a doorman in=
 a crisp uniform opens the rear door to the car and extends a hand to the pa=
ssengers inside.&nbsp; Two well-dressed people emerge from the limousine and=
 stride up a red carpet to the entrance.&nbsp; The maitre d' leads them into=
 a grand dining room with polished oak walls and shimmering chandeliers and =
ushers them to their seats, at the center of an enormous banquet.</I>=20
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The table, arranged in a U-shape, is illuminat=
ed with warmly glowing candles and covered with crystal, silver, festive flo=
wer arrangements, and platters overflowing with loaves of freshly-baked brea=
d and fresh fruit.&nbsp; Surrounding them on three sides are smiling, elegan=
tly-dressed people.&nbsp; </I></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Amidst the hushed chatter, the sound of a spoo=
n clinking a glass resounds across the room.&nbsp; The people around the tab=
le look up to the center of the table and raise sparkling glasses of champag=
ne to salute the guests of honor.&nbsp; And as one of the guests of honor ra=
ises their glass, a brilliant diamond ring catches the light and shines brig=
htly.&nbsp; Everyone around the table applauds.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memo, I was so excited by this vision, I wrote it=
 down in detail, and even then, it took two more hours before I could fall b=
ack asleep.&nbsp; Then, as often happens, just before daylight I woke up aga=
in and immediately <U>had a second vision</U>:&nbsp;</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is early evening, and a crowd of p=
eople are crammed in the waiting area of a large chain restaurant. A line of=
 more people extends out the door and into the parking lot, where a minivan =
circles around, in search of a parking space.&nbsp; The open door allows hot=
 humid air into the crowded lobby.&nbsp; People on seats fan themselves whil=
e children run around unrestrained and a baby cries off to one side.</I>=20
<P><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of eight adults arrives, and while oth=
ers wait at the end of the line, one of their party squeezes to the front to=
 ask the host about their reservations.&nbsp; The host, harried and impatien=
t, scans the reservation book and says no reservation is in the book.&nbsp;<=
/I></P>
<P><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person assures the host that they called w=
ell in advance and were assured of a table, but the host replies, "Even if y=
ou had a reservation, we're overbooked, and the wait will be 45 minutes to a=
n hour." Outside, the empty minivan has its lights on, but no one, including=
 its owners, notices.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>I was so tense after the second vision, I had to take s=
ome<BR>deep breaths just to release the stress!</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, I wrote down the details as quickly as=
 I could and then I took a long walk to clear my mind and make sense of what=
 these side-by-side visions could mean for you.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I don't want to sound like a broken record=
, Memo, but it is so important for you to remember that with all of your ext=
raordinary strengths, talents and abilities, <U>you are on the threshold of =
an amazing streak of good fortune that could supercharge your life with mone=
y, love and happiness</U>.&nbsp; Starting May 16th, all you'll have to do is=
 walk through the door that is opening to you!</P>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>But these visions told me that<BR>two different outcome=
s were possible</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You could virtually soar through a wide-open gate=
, carried on the shoulders of people who care about and support you, or <U>s=
omeone could be standing between you and the door to your good fortune</U>.<=
/P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one thing that struck me about these visions =
was the contrast between the two groups of people.&nbsp; One group was elega=
nt, affluent and self-assured, with an occasion for celebration and access t=
o well-appointed, top-notch establishments.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other was ordinary and lacked influence...una=
ble, even with advance planning, to gain access to a regular chain restauran=
t. This second group seemed careless as well, as demonstrated by the minivan=
 with its lights left on, which is also a metaphor for the draining of power=
...the draining of your power, Memo.</P>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>This is the meaning of the negative energy that could g=
et <BR>in the way of the shining destiny I see for you!</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who you have around you will make all the differe=
nce in your ability to take your cycle of good fortune and turn it into the =
reality you've always dreamed of!</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I've said before, this is a time when money, l=
ove, and extraordinary luck will be there for you, like an overflowing horn =
of plenty, and all you have to do is reach out and take what you want.</P>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>This is a time when your greatest strengths, gifts and =
<BR>abilities can really shine.</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But "no person is an island..." That is why it is=
 so important for you to know whether someone close to you is ready, willing=
 and able to scale the greatest heights with you or whether they'll turn out=
 to be a nay-sayer or a hanger-on, who will hold you back, drain your energy=
 and power or begrudge you the fabulous gifts and benefits that are yours by=
 right!</P>
