 across the River Tyne between Newcastle and Gateshead. Taken from the deck of
 the Gateshead Millennium Bridge, looking west and upstream.]] The  River Tyne 
 is a river in England. It is formed by the confluence of two rivers, the North
 Tyne and the South Tyne. These two rivers converge at Warden Rock near Hexham
 in Northumberland at a place dubbed the Meeting of the Waters.

The River Tyne has a charity dedicated to protecting and enhancing its waters
and surrounding areas. The Tyne Rivers Trust [http   www.tyneriverstrust.org],
established in 2004, is a community based organisation that works to a  Improve
Habitat b Get better information and promote better understanding of the Tyne
Catchment and c  Build the reputation of the Tyne Catchment as a place of
environmental excellence.

The  North Tyne  rises on the Scottish border, north of Kielder Water. It flows
through Kielder Forest, and passes through no major settlements before Hexham.

The  South Tyne  rises on Alston Moor, Cumbria and flow through the towns of
Haltwhistle and Haydon Bridge, in a valley often called the Tyne Gap. Hadrian s
Wall lies to the North of the Tyne Gap. Coincidentally the source of the South
Tyne is very close to the sources of the other two great rivers of the
industrial north east namely the Tees and the Wear.

The combined Tyne flows from Hexham through Corbridge in Northumberland. It
enters the county of Tyne and Wear between Clara Vale  on the South bank in
Gateshead  and Tyne Riverside Country Park  on the North bank in Newcastle upon
Tyne  and continues to divide Newcastle and Gateshead for 13 miles, during which
it is spanned by 10 bridges. To the East of Gateshead and Newcastle, the Tyne
divides Hebburn and Jarrow on the South bank from Wallsend and North Shields.
Jarrow and North Shields are linked underneath the river by the Tyne Tunnel.
Finally it flows between South Shields and Tynemouth into the North Sea. As it
passes through the Tyneside conurbation, the river marks the pre 1974 border
between County Durham  to the south  and Northumberland  to the north .

The Tyne was a major route for the export of coal from the 13th century until
the decline of the coalfields of North East England in the second half of the
20th century. Dramatic wooden staithes  a structure for loading coal onto ships 
have been preserved at Dunston in Gateshead, although partly damaged by
fire[http   news.bbc.co.uk 1 hi england tyne 3222530.stm].

The lower reaches of the Tyne were, in the late 19th and early 20th century, one
of the world s most important centres of shipbuilding, and there are still major
shipyards at Wallsend on the north of the river and Hebburn on the south.

To support the shipbuilding and export industries of Tyneside, the lower reaches
of the river were extensively remodelled during the second half of the 19th
century, with islands removed and meanders in the river straightened.

Origins Nothing definite is known of the origin of the designation  Tyne , nor
is the river known by that name until the Saxon period  Tynemouth is recorded in
Anglo Saxon as Tinanmu  e  probably dative case . There is a theory that T  n
was a word that meant  river  in the local Celtic language or in a language
spoken in England before the Celts came  compare Tardebigge.

The River Vedra on the Roman map of Britain may be the Tyne, or may be the River
Wear. The late Thomas John Taylor supposed that the main course of the river
anciently flowed through what is now Team Valley, its outlet into the tidal
river being by a waterfall at Bill Point. His theory is not far from the truth,
as there is evidence that prior to the last Ice Age, the River Wear did once
follow the current route of the lower River Team, merging with the Tyne at
Dunston. Ice diverted the course of the Wear to its current location, flowing
east from Washington  virtually parallel to the course of the Tyne  and joining
the North Sea at Sunderland.
