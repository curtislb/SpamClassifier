Please excuse my intrusion into your private life as i write you this letter 
in good faith and to the Glory of Almighty who thus brought me out clean after 
all the allegations levelled against me after the death of my Father General 
Sani Abacha.

I am Mallam Mohammed Abacha, son of late General Sani Ibrahim Abacha.The 
former Head of State and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal 
Republic of Nigeria who died in active service to his mother land.
 
Since my father's death and my detention for years, my family has been loosing 
a lot of money due to vindictive government officials who are bent on dealing 
with my family. Prior to my  release the federal government of Nigeria made me 
sign some documents that will enable them extract over Five Hundred Million 
United States Dollars from my late fathers bank accounts in London, 
Switzerland, Luxembourg, Liechtenstein and Jersey etc.

My family and i are looking for a trustworthy foreign partner who can assist 
us by taking possession of the total sum of $15.000, 000.00 (Fifteen Million 
United States dollars), which the government did not know about because it was 
safely kept in Finance and Security Firm overseas.

The Swiss government has already frozen all other accounts of my family in 
Switzerland, and some other Countries also tried doing like wise, this whole 
bid is a vindictive move initiated by the present government who had a lot of 
issues with my father. It is imperative that I inform you that the present 
president was sentenced to a life jail term because of a failed coup attempt 
on my father’s government.

This move by some government officials to deal with my family has made it 
necessary that i seek your assistance in receiving this money and in investing 
it on behalf of my family, this must be a joint venture transaction and we 
must all work together.

I am willing to offer you 25% of the $15mUSD for your assistance in this 
project.

As soon as i hear from you, i will give you all necessary details as to how we 
intend to carry out the whole transaction. Please, do not entertain any fears, 
as all necessary modalities are in place, and i assure you of all success and 
safety in this transaction.

If you are interested in assisting me please send me your consent and 
telephone number.

I look forward to working with you.

Thank you

Mohammed Abacha.
