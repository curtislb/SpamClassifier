 Earthworm  is the common name for the largest members of the Oligochaeta  which
is either a class or subclass depending on the author  in the phylum Annelida.
In classical systems they were placed in the order  Opisthopora , on the basis
of the male pores opening to the outside of body posterior to the female pores,
even though the male segments are anterior to the female. Cladistic studies have
supported placing them instead in the suborder  Lumbricina  of the order
Haplotaxida. Folk names for earthworm include  dew worm ,  night crawler  and
 angleworm .

Earthworms are also called  megadriles   or big worms , as opposed to the
microdriles, which include the families Tubificidae, Lumbriculidae, and
Enchytraeidae, among others. The megadriles are characterized by having a
multilayered clitellum  which is much more obvious than the single layered one
of the microdriles , a vascular system with true capillaries, and male pores
behind the female pores.

Overview There are over 5,500 named species known worldwide, everywhere but
Polar and arid climates. They range in size from two centimeters  less than one
inch  to over three meters  almost ten feet  in the Giant Gippsland Earthworm.
Amongst the main earthworm species commonly found in temperate regions are the
reddish coloured, deep burrowing [[Lumbricus terrestris]].

In temperate zone areas, the most commonly seen earthworms are lumbricids
 Lumbricidae , mostly due to the recent rapid spread of a relatively small
number of European species, but there are many other families, e.g.
Megascolecidae, Octochaetidae, Sparganophilidae, Glossoscolecidae, etc.. These
other families are often differ from the lumbricids in behavior, physiology and
habitat.

The average earthworm grows to be 5 to 6 inches long.



Anatomy Earthworms have a closed circulatory system. They have two main blood
vessels that extend through the length of their body  a ventral blood vessel
which leads the blood to the posterior end, and a dorsal blood vessel which
leads to the anterior end. The dorsal vessel is contractile and pumps blood
forward, where it is pumped into the ventral vessel by a series of  bones 
 aortic arches  which vary in number in the different taxa. A typical lumbricid
will have 5 pairs of hearts  a total of 10. The blood is distributed from the
ventral vessel into capillaries on the body wall and other organs and into a
vascular sinus in the gut wall where gases and nutrients are exchanged. This
arrangement may be complicated in the various groups by suboesophageal,
supraoesophageal, parietal and neural vessels, but the basic arrangement holds
in all earthworms.



[[Reproduction]]

Earthworms are monoecious  both female and male organs within the same
individual . They have testes, seminal vesicles and male pores which produce,
store and release the sperm, and ovaries and ovipores. However, most also have
one or more pairs of spermathecae  depending on the species  that are internal
sacs which receive and store sperm from the other worm in copulation. Some
species use external spermatophores for transfer instead. Copulation and
reproduction are separate processes in earthworms. The mating pair overlap front
ends ventrally and each exchanges sperm with the other. The cocoon, or egg case,
is secreted by the clitellum, the external glandular band which is near the
front of the worm, but behind the spermathecae. Some indefinite time after
copulation, long after the worms have separated, the clitellum secretes the
cocoon which forms a ring around the worm. The worm then backs out of the ring,
and as it does so, injects its own eggs and the other worm s sperm into it. As
the worm slips out, the ends of the cocoon seal to form a vaguely lemon shaped
incubator  cocoon  in which the embryonic worms develop. They emerge as small,
but fully formed earthworms, except for lacking the sexual structures, which
develop later. Some earthworm species are mostly parthenogenetic, in which case
the male structures and spermathecae may become abnormal, or missing.

Regeneration

Earthworms have the facility to replace or replicate lost segments, but this
ability varies between species and depends on the extent of the damage.
Stephenson  1930  devoted a chapter of his great monograph to this topic, while
G.E. Gates spent 10 years studying regeneration in a variety of species, but
   because little interest was shown   , Gates  1972  only published a few of
his findings that, nevertheless, show it is theoretically possible to grow two
whole worms from a bisected specimen in certain species. Gates   s reports
included   Eisenia fetida  Savigny, 1826  with head regeneration, in an anterior
direction, possible at each intersegmental level back to and including 23 24,
while tails were regenerated at any levels behind 20 21.  Lumbricus terrestris
 Linneus, 1758  replacing anterior segments from as far back as 13 14 and 16 17
but tail regeneration was never found.  Perionyx excavatus  Perrier, 1872 
readily regenerated lost parts of the body, in an anterior direction from as far
back as 17 18, and in a posterior direction as far forward as 20 21.  Lampito
mauritii  Kinberg, 1867  with regeneration in anterior direction at all levels
back to 25 26 and tail regeneration from 30 31  head regeneration was sometimes
believed to be caused by internal amputation resulting from [[Sarcophaga]] sp.
larval infestation.

An unidentified Tasmanian earthworm shown growing a second head is reported
here  [http   www.qvmag.tas.gov.au zoology invertebrata printarchive printtext

Behavior

Rainstorms

One often sees earthworms come to the surface in large numbers after a
rainstorm. There </STYLE>
