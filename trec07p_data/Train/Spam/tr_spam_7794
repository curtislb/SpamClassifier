The  Grand Duchy of Luxembourg   , ,  , archaically  Luxemburg , is a small
landlocked country in western Europe, bordered by Belgium, France, and Germany.
Luxembourg has a population of under half a million people in an area of
approximately 2,585 square kilometres  998 nbsp sq nbsp mi , which is slightly
smaller than the American state of Rhode Island.

Luxembourg is a parliamentary representative democracy with a constitutional
monarchy, ruled by a Grand Duke. It is the world s only sovereign Grand Duchy.
The country has a highly developed economy, with the highest Gross Domestic
Product per capita in the world. Luxembourg is a founding member of the European
Union, NATO, the United Nations, Benelux, and the Western European Union,
reflecting the political consensus in favour of economic, political, and
military integration. The city of Luxembourg, the capital and largest city, is
the seat of several institutions and agencies of the European Union.

Luxembourg lies on the cultural divide between Romance Europe and Germanic
Europe, borrowing customs from each of the distinct traditions. While French and
Luxembourgish are the predominant languages in daily life and on the streets,
Luxembourg remains a trilingual country  French, German, and Luxembourgish are
official languages. Although a secular state, Luxembourg is predominantly Roman
Catholic.

History

The recorded history of Luxembourg begins with the acquisition of Lucilinburhuc
 today Luxembourg Castle  by Siegfried, Count of Ardennes in 963. The current
name of Luxembourg comes from the former name Lucilinburhuc. Around this fort, a
town gradually developed, which became the centre of a small, but important,
state of great strategic value. In 1437, the House of Luxembourg suffered a
succession crisis, precipitated by the lack of a male heir to assume the throne.
In the following centuries, Luxembourg s fortress was steadily enlarged and
strengthened over the years by its successive occupants, the Bourbons,
Habsburgs, Hohenzollerns, and the French, among others. After the defeat of
Napoleon in 1815, Luxembourg was disputed between Prussia and the Netherlands.
The Congress of Vienna formed Luxembourg as a Grand Duchy in personal union with
the Netherlands. Luxembourg also became a member of the German Confederation,
with a Confederate fortress manned by Prussian troops.

 have greatly reduced Luxembourg s territory.]] The Belgian Revolution of
 1830   1839 reduced Luxembourg s territory by more than half, as the
 predominantly francophone western part of the country was transferred to
 Belgium. Luxembourg s independence was reaffirmed by the 1839 First Treaty of
 London. In the same year, Luxembourg joined the Zollverein. Luxembourg s
 independence and neutrality were again affirmed by the 1867 Second Treaty of
 London, after the Luxembourg Crisis nearly led to war between Prussia and
 France. After the latter conflict, the Confederate fortress was dismantled.

The King of the Netherlands remained Head of State as Grand Duke of Luxembourg,
maintaining personal union between the two countries until 1890. At the death of
William III, the Dutch throne passed to his daughter Wilhelmina, while
Luxembourg  at that time restricted to male heirs  see Salic Law  passed to
Adolph of Nassau Weilburg.

Luxembourg was invaded and occupied by Germany during the First World War, but
was allowed to maintain its independence and political mechanisms. It was again
subject to German occupation in the Second World War, and was formally annexed
into the Third Reich in 1942, although it was invaded in May 1940.

During World War II, Luxembourg abandoned its policy of neutrality, when it
joined the Allies in fighting Germany. Its government, exiled to London, set up
a small group of volunteers who participated in the Normandy invasion. It became
a founding member of the United Nations in 1946, and of NATO in 1949. In 1957,
Luxembourg became one</STYLE>
