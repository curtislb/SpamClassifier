 Aristophanes   Greek  , ca. 446 BC     ca. 388 BC  was a Greek Old Comic
dramatist. He is also known as the Father of Comedy and the Prince of Ancient
Comedy. [http   manybooks.net support b brewere brewere1143111431 8.exp.html]

Biography The place and exact date of his birth are unknown, but he was around
thirty in the 420s when he achieved sudden brilliant success in the Theater of
Dionysus with his Banqueters. He lived in the deme of Kudathenaion  the same as
that of the leading Athenian statesman Cleon  which implies he was from a
relatively wealthy family and, accordingly, well educated. He is famous for
writing comedies such as [[The Birds  play /The Birds]] for the two Athenian
dramatic festivals  the City Dionysia and the Lenea. He wrote forty plays,
eleven of which survive  his plays are the only surviving complete examples of
Old Attic Comedy, although extensive fragments of the work of his rough
contemporaries Cratinus and Eupolis survive. Many of Aristophanes  plays were
political, and often satirized well known citizens of Athens and their conduct
in the Peloponnesian War and after. Hints in the text of his plays, supported by
ancient scholars, suggest that he was prosecuted several times by Cleon for
defaming Athens in the presence of foreigners and the like  how much truth there
is to this is impossible to say. [[The Frogs]] was given the unprecedented honor
of a second performance. According to a later biographer, he was also awarded a
civic crown for the play.

Aristophanes was probably victorious at least once at the City Dionysia, with
Babylonians in 426  IG II2 2325. 58 , and at least three times at the Lenaia,
with [[Acharnians]] in 425, [[The Knights]] in 424, and [[The Frogs/Frogs]] in
405. His sons Araros, Philippus, and Nicostratus were also comic poets  Araros
is said to have been heavily involved in the production of Wealth II in 388
 test. 1. 54   6  and to have been responsible for the posthumous performances
of Aeolosicon II and Cocalus  Cocalus test. iii , with which he seems to have
taken the prize at the City Dionysia in 387  IG II2 2318. 196 , while Philippus
was twice victorious at the Lenaia  IG II2 2325. 140  and apparently produced
some of Eubulus    comedies  Eub. test. 4 .  Aristophanes    third son is
sometimes said to have been called not Nicostratus but Philetaerus, and a man by
that name appears in the catalogue of Lenaia victors with two victories, the
first probably in the late 370s, at IG II2 2325. 143  just after Anaxandrides
and just before Eubulus . 

Aristophanes appears as a character in Plato s [[Symposium  Plato /Symposium]],
in which he offers a humorous mythical account of the origin of Love. Plato s
text was produced a generation after the events it portrays and is a patent
apologetic attempt to show that Socrates and Aristophanes were not enemies,
despite the attack on the philosopher in [[The Clouds]]  original production 423
BCE . The Symposium is therefore best treated as an early chapter in the history
of the reception of Aristophanes and his poetry rather than as a description of
anything approaching a historical event.

Of the surviving plays, [[The Clouds]] was a disastrous production resulting in
a humiliating and long remembered third place  cf. the parabasis of the revised
 preserved  version of the play, and the parabasis of the following year s [[The
Wasps]] . The play, which satirizes the sophistic learning en vogue among the
aristocracy at the time, placed poorly at the City Dionysia. Socrates was the
principal target and emerges as a typical Sophist  in Plato s Apology at 18d,
the character of Socrates suggests that it was the foundation of those charges
which led to Socrates  conviction. [[Lysistrata]] was written during the
Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta and argues not so much for pacifism
as for the idea that the states ought not be fighting one another at this point
but combining to rule Greece. In the play, this is accomplished </STYLE>
