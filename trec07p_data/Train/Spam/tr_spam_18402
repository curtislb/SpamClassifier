<br /><br />

SMP developed a revolutionary production method that is self-contained=
, immediate, portable, competitive, accessible because it is so cost-e=
ffective and=20
transportable by any means whatsoever: by land, sea, railroad or air w=
ith more than hundreds Small and Mobile Production systems. From a tec=
hnological=20
standpoint, it is an incontrovertible fact that this system is aimed a=
t solving very serious problems, starting with that which is most basi=
c: the survival of millions=20
of human beings.

<br /><br />

The SMP is the only  system in the world that can provide up to six of=
 the most essential products for basic sustenance for just one dollar =
per day. SMP will=20
supply to countries and developing regions the technology and necessar=
y support for these Small and Mobile Units.
