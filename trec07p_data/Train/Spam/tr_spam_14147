 in London]]  Anthony Neil Wedgwood Benn   born April 3, 1925 , known as  Tony
 Benn , formerly  2nd Viscount Stansgate , is a British politician on the left
 of the Labour Party. He was instrumental in the creation of the Peerage Act
 1963. The term  Bennite , generally understood to mean someone of a radical but
 democratic left wing position, was derived from Benn s
 name. ref [http   pubs.socialistreviewindex.org.uk sr205 labour.htm Socialist
 Review, February 1997   Does Labours Left Have an Alternative?]  ref  He is
 known as one of the few politicians to have become more left wing after holding
 ministerial office. ref Tony Benn, Dare to be A Daniel  Then and Now  Arrow
 Books, 2006, ISBN 0 09 947153 1 , p.166  ref  He has been a vegetarian since
 the 1970s.

Family background Benn s paternal grandfather was Sir John Benn, 1st Baronet and
his father was the 1st Viscount Stansgate  whilst the Wedgwood side of his
ancestry  through Sir John s wife  connected him to the family of Josiah
Wedgwood, their common ancestor being Gilbert Wedgwood  1588 1678  who
established the family as Potters in Burslem, Staffordshire. In October 1973 he
announced on BBC radio that he wished to be known as  Mr. Tony Benn . His book
Speeches from 1974 is credited to Tony Benn, but much of the media persisted
with Anthony Wedgwood Benn into the late 1980s. He was frequently known to the
public as Wedgwood Benn or  Wedgy Benn , the latter usually with pejorative
connotations.

His father William Wedgwood Benn was a Liberal Member of Parliament  MP  who
defected to Labour and was later elevated to the House of Lords with the title
of 1st Viscount Stansgate. Both his grandfathers Sir John Williams Benn  who
founded the family publishing house  and Daniel Holmes were also Liberal MPs
 respectively, for St. George s, Tower Hamlets, Devonport and Glasgow Govan .
Benn s contact with leading people of the day thus goes back to his earliest
years as a result of his family s profile  he met David Lloyd George when he was
twelve and Gandhi in 1931 while his father was Secretary of State for India.

His mother Margaret Eadie  n  e Holmes   1897 1991 , was a dedicated theologian,
founder President of the Congregational Federation and feminist. She was member
of the League of the Church Militant which was the predecessor of the Movement
for the Ordination of Women. In 1925 she was rebuked by Randall Thomas Davidson,
the then Archbishop of Canterbury, for advocating the ordination of women. This
would prove that she was ahead of her time, as it would happen over 60 years
later. His mother s theology had a profound influence on Tony, as she taught him
to support the prophets and not the Kings, as the prophets taught righteousness.

He was a pupil at Westminster School and studied at New College, Oxford during
which time he was elected as President of the Oxford Union. In later life Benn
attempted to remove public references to his private education from Who s Who 
in the 1975 edition his entry stated  Education mdash still in progress . In the
1976 edition, almost all details of his biography were omitted save for his
name, jobs as a Member of Parliament and as a Government minister, and address 
the publishers confirmed that Benn had sent back his draft entry with everything
else struck through.  ref name  Times Diary   Mr Benn wipes away his past , The
Times Diary, [[The Times]], 18 March 1976.  ref  In the 1977 edition, Benn s
entry disappeared entirely.  ref name  Times Diary 2   Not Out , The Times
Diary, [[The Times]], 4 April, 1977.  ref 

Benn met US born Caroline Middleton DeCamp  Born 13 October 1926   from
Cincinnati, Ohio, daughter of a lawyer  over tea at Worcester College in 1949
and nine days later he proposed to her on a park bench in the city. Later, he
bought the bench from Oxford City Council and installed it in the garden of
their house in Holland Park. Tony and Caroline had four children   Stephen,
Hilary, Melissa  a journalist  and Joshua, and ten grandchildren. Caroline Benn
died of cancer on 22 November 2000 aged 74 after a career as a prominent
educationalist.

In July 1943, Benn joined the Royal Air Force. ref name  BioChannel  [http   ww

The Biography Channel. Retrieved on 2 April 2007.  ref  His father and brother
Michael  who was later killed in action  were already serving in the RAF in
1943. Whilst holding the rank of pilot officer, Tony Benn served as a pilot in
South Africa and Rhodesia. ref

His children have also been active in politics and his son Hilary is a Labour MP
