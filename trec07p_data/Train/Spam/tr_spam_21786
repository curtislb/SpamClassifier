Dear valued member.
This letter is a piece of advice by IPN (Internet Pharmacy Network) – officially registered organization dealing with the problem of mass drug falsification.
No matter how wide the choice of meds is, always try to cling to generic ones. Moreover, it would be better to purchase them from reliable pharmacies, such as USDrugs. Don’t forget that the pharmacy you shop at should be licensed.
Hope that you take our advice seriously. Take care.
