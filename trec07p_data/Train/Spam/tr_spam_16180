Hi,

Is there an easy way to make a chart automatically include new rows as
they are entered? 

I currently have a spreadsheet with three columns: A, B and C. 
Column A contains dates (i.e. the period, ex: June 2005)
Column B and C contains figures for the period.
<!I made a post FS/FT A? recently and when I finished it the message said
your post will take 3-10 hours to appear. Not more than 5 minutes
later I received a E-mail reply to the post. I could not view my post
until 5.5 hours later at 12:30 in the morning. I replied back to the
E-mail and asked him how he seen the post so quickly. He said he just
seen it come up and that the post time delay may have something to do
with my ISP! I sent a question to Google groups support but their
reply was they were very busy and it may take some time to respond! I
checked their FAQ's to no avail. My ISP is a cable company DSL hi
speed line.

Can anyone shed some light on this. Is there anything the member can
do differently to see these posts as soon as they are released. If it
is the ISP what do you tell them to do differently? Is there a better
URL or IP address to access??

Appreciate any replies,
Rich

PACKERS CHASING BELL

Bell was acquired by the Lions last week as part of the Dre' Bly deal.  As we've reported, both Bell and former Broncos tackle
George Foster are candidates to be traded again.

We're also told that the Packers contacted the Bears about the availability of running back Thomas Jones, but the Bears said that he
is not available.  It remains to be seen whether the Bears would be willing to trade him to a team other than their intra-division
arch-rivals.

I think it might have something to do with

Tools/Options/Send/News Sending Format

Can the off the automatic word wrap be disabled?
I've heard that there's another Two-Wheeled Tuesday somewhere
west of the city.  Anyone been there or know of any others in the
area?

I've seen a different version of the Macross Plus LDs called 
Macross Plus International Edition. I asked somebody about
them and my friend said they're supposed to be something
similar to the Pioneer LDs, english on the digital track, japanese
on the analog, and closed captioning. Can somebody please
confirm this? (so I can go out and buy these LDs right now :)

><!Hi...

I'm selling on eBay (link below) a brand new condition copy of the &quot;jp
airline-fleets international edition 96/97&quot;. This is the most
comprehensive guide to the airline fleets of all countries. Includes
info on complete fleets, types of aircraft, numbers, registration
numbers, etc. A very impressive book.
