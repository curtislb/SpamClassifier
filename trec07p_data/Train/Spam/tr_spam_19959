The  Elbe       Low German  De Ilv  is one of the major rivers of Central
Europe. It originates in the northwestern Czech Republic before traversing much
of Germany and flowing into the North Sea. Its total length has been given as
1,091 kilometers or 678 miles.

History The Elbe was recorded by Ptolemy as Albis  Germanic for  white   in
Germania Magna with its source in the Asciburgis mountains  Krkono  e,
Riesengebirge or Giant Mountains , where the Germanic [[Vandalii]] lived.

Geography The Elbe rises at an elevation of about 1400 m  4593 ft  in the
Krkono  e  also known as Giant Mountains or in German as Riesengebirge  on the
north west borders of the Czech Republic. Of the numerous small streams whose
waters compose the infant river, the most important is the B  l   Labe, or White
Elbe. After plunging down the 60 m of the Labsk   vodop  d, the latter stream
unites with the steeply torrential Mal   Labe, and thereafter the united stream
of the Elbe pursues a southerly course, emerging from the mountain glens at and
continuing on to Pardubice, where it turns sharply to the west. At Kol  n some
43 km  27 miles  further on, it bends gradually towards the north west. At the
village of K  ran  , a little above Brand  s nad Labem it picks up the Jizera
and at M  ln  k its stream is more than doubled in volume by the Vltava, or
Moldau, a river which winds northwards through Bohemia. Some distance lower
down, at Litom    ice, the waters of the Elbe are tinted by the reddish Oh  e.
Thus augmented, and swollen into a stream 140 m  459 ft  wide, the Elbe carves a
path through the basaltic mass of the   esk   St  edoho    , churning its way
through a deep, narrow rocky gorge. Shortly after crossing the Czech German
frontier, and passing through the sandstone defiles of the Elbe Sandstone
Mountains, the stream assumes a north westerly direction, which on the whole it
preserves right to the North Sea.

The river rolls through Dresden and finally, beyond Meissen, enters on its long
journey across the North German Plain passing along the former border of East
Germany, touching Torgau, Wittenberg, Dessau, Magdeburg, Wittenberge, and
Hamburg on the way, and taking on the waters of the Mulde and Saale from the
west, and those of the Schwarze Elster, Havel and Elde from the east. Soon the
Elbe reaches Hamburg, and then passes through Holstein until it flows into the
North Sea at Cuxhaven. Near its mouth it passes Gl  ckstadt, Brunsb  ttel and
the entrance to the Kiel Canal.

The Elbe is about 1,091 km  678 miles  long.

Navigation The Elbe has been navigable by commercial vessels since 1842, and
provides important trade links as far inland as Prague. The river is linked by
canals to the industrial areas of Germany and to Berlin. The Elbe L  beck Canal
links the Elbe to the Baltic Sea, as does the Kiel Canal, whose western entrance
is near the mouth of the Elbe.

Before Germany was reunited, waterway transport in Western Germany was hindered
by the fact that inland navigation to Hamburg had to pass through the German
Democratic Republic. The Elbe Seitenkanal  Elbe Lateral Canal  was built between
the Mittellandkanal and the lower Elbe to restore this connection. When the two
nations were reunited, works began to improve and restore the original links 
the Elbe Canal Bridge near Magdeburg now allows large barges to cross the Elbe
without having to enter the river. The often low water levels of the Elbe do not
hinder navigation to Berlin any longer.  Source

Etymology Its name means  river   cf. Scandinavian   lv .

History The Elbe has long been an important delineator of European geography.
The Romans knew the river as the Albis  however, they only attempted once to
move the Eastern border of their empire forward from the Rhine to the Elbe, and
this attempt failed in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in 9 AD, after which
they never seriously tried again. In the Middle Ages it formed the eastern limit
of the Empire of Charlemagne. The river s navigable sections were also essential
to the success of the Hanseatic League and much trade was carried on its waters.

In 1945, as World War II was drawing to a close, Nazi Germany was caught between
the armies of the west</STYLE>
