Hi, I hate to be the one to mention this, but people 
at work are talking about your weight issue and it just 
disgusts me. Whether you know it by now, people are 
always chattering about each other at work but you come 
up more than enough. I feel the right thing to do is to 
letyou know now before this gets worse. I wasn't the 
happiest or best-fit a year ago or so but I managed to 
change that thanks to my sister-in-law(of all people). 
Anyhow, it was for the best. What I am saying is that 
you need to do something different and maybe you can 
make the same difference I did. Try this stuff I used. 
I took it on the idea it's just more junk but it worked 
great. I see more positive reviews on it nowadays and 
makes me feel even better. So, I am encouraging a change, 
not only in the chatter around here but in you personally 
if you are willing. 
-Anonymous for now 

Here is the website below I have ordered from.
