Hey Nick, 

it was really fun going out the other night 
and talking, while we were out you said that you felt
insecure about your manhood, I noticed in the toilets
you were quite small in that area : ) , but not to 
worry.. that website that I was telling you about is 
my secret weapon to an extra 3 inches, trust me.. girls
love bigger ones, I've had 5 times as many chicks 
since I used these pills a year ago. The package I used
was the 6 month supply one,  and its worth every 
cent and more.. the website is http://ctmay.com 
Ring me on the weekend and we will go out and drink 
again and let you know some more secrets : ).
Later dude, Brad
