]]  Table tennis   also commonly known as  ping pong  , is a sport in which two
or four players hit a ball back and forth to each other with paddles  also
called bats . The game takes place on a table divided by a net. Players must
allow a ball played towards them only one bounce on their side of the table and
must return it so that it bounces on the opponent s side. Play is fast and
demands quick reactions. A skilled player can impart spin to the ball, which
makes its bounce and its reaction on the opponent s bat difficult to predict or
return with confidence.

Table tennis is very popular, especially in East Asia  ref

General description


Table tennis is an Olympic sport where two or four players hit a ball with a
paddle back and forth to each other on a table, in a manner similar to tennis.
The rules are slightly different, but the concept is basically the same. When
you serve, the ball is not required to hit the opposite box on the table, but
many people believe it is supposed to because of its sister sport Tennis. Ball
spin, speed, placement, strategy and tactics play an important part in
competitive table tennis matches. The speed of the ball can vary from slow
serves with much spin to smashes that travel as fast as 112.5 kilometers per
hour  69.9 miles per hour . ref  [http   www.ittf.com ittf_juniors Stories_deta 
il.asp?Year  General_Catigory  ID 4885 PT_Title New+Zealand+Junior+Open+ 28NZL  
29 Year1 2003 Speed of ball article from the International Table Tennis
Federation]  ref 

The game is played on a 274 cm  9 ft.   times  152.5 cm  5 ft.   times  76 cm
 2.5 ft.  high playing surface. The International Table Tennis Federation
requires an area not less than 14 m  46 ft  long, 7 m  23 ft  wide and 5 m  16
ft  high for competitions. No limitations in size or shape are specified. Modern
bats usually have a thin layer of rubber covering the paddle s striking surface.
The rubber may have pimples pointing outwards or inwards, as well as a thin
layer of sponge between the plywood center and the rubber surface. Since spin
plays a large role in the modern sport of table tennis, the composition of the
rubber and the combination of sponge and rubber is designed to maximize the
amount of spin and speed a player can impart onto the ball. Other technological
improvements include the use of carbon or other synthetic layers as part of the
blade to increase the sweet spot or the stiffness of the blade.

The ball used in table tennis has a diameter of 40 mm, is made of celluloid, and
is completely hollow. A three star rating on a ball usually implies a top
quality ball, in relation to its bounce, roundness and their respective
consistency between balls of the same make and type.

The winner is the first to score 11 points, with each player alternating serves
every two points. At 10 10  or deuce  the players alternate with every serve 
the winner is then the first person to gain a clear two points advantage over
his opponent. The 11 point game is an International Table Tennis Federation
 ITTF  change which occurred in 2001. All games played at national level and at
international tournaments  ITTF  are played to 11 points in either a best of
five  5  games  preliminaries  or best of seven  7  games format  championship
matches .

History ]] Table tennis has its origins in England as an after dinner amusement
for upper class Victorians in the 1880s. Mimicking the game of tennis in an
indoor environment, everyday objects were originally enlisted to act as the
equipment. A line of books would be the net, a rounded top of a Champagne cork
or knot of string as the ball, and a cigar box lid as the bat.

The popularity of the game led game manufacturers to sell the equipment
commercially. Early bats were often pieces of parchment stretched upon a frame,
and the sound generated in play gave the game its first nicknames of  whiff
whaff  and  Ping pong.  A number of sources indicate that the game was first
brought to the attention of Hamley s of Regent Street under the name  Gossima .
The name ping pong was in wide use before English manufacturer J. Jaques   Son
Ltd trademarked it in 1901. The name ping pong then came to be used for the game
played by the rather expensive Jaques equipment, with other manufacturers
calling theirs table tennis. A similar situation came to exist in the United
States where Jaques sold the rights to the ping pong name to Parker Brothers.
The term is now used as a generic name for table tennis.

The next major innovation was by James Gibb, ref
