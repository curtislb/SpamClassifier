Hello,
I am Mr James Lomani an Attorney with a Law Firm in the United Kingdom.I am writing this letter to solicit for your support and assistance to carry out this business opportunity. Lying in an in-active account is the sum of 11milion pounds sterling belonging to my late client (Michael Lago) who was a gas consultant , who happens 
to be deceased. Ever since he died the Security and finance Company here in the Uk has been expecting his next of kin to come and claim this fund to the fact that he was never married and left no name for his next of kin. To this effect, the Security and finance Company has given directives that unless someone applies for it as next of kin, as indicated in the banking guideline through the legal and proper ways. Unfortunately he has no family member in UK or Over-sea who are aware of the existence of the money as he was a gas consultant. At this juncture i have decided to do business with you.To this effect I solicit your assistance in applying as the next of kin to the Security and finance Company then the money will be released to you, as I do not want this money to go into the treasury as an unclaimed bill, because the banking law and guideline 
stipulates that if such money(s) remains unclaimed for a period of up to eight years(8yrs), the money will be transferred into the banks treasury as an unclaimed bill. My request for a foreigner as next of kin is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a British cannot stand as next of kin. 25% of the money will be your 
share as a foreign partner and your assistance to actualize this business,5% for any expenses incurred. Thereafter i will visit your country with your help once the money is transfered into your account for disbursement accordingly. To effect the immediate transfer of the fund to you as agreed,you must apply first to the Security and finance Company as the next of kin to the deceased,then i will follow up all formalities for the transaction. I am here as the late Michael Iago's attorney and also to help you out in any way i can and to let you know that all modalities have been put in place to see this transaction come to a success. Upon receipt of your reply, i will send to you, the text of the application you are to send to the Security and finance Company and further clarify you in other issues as to affect this transaction.

Best Regards,

Lomani James ESQ
