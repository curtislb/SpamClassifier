Dear valued member!
This letter is a part of the official program initiated by the United American Health Department – please, read it to the end if you regularly buy drugs on the Web.
It’s not a secret that many Web pharmacies are trying to make profits by selling fake drugs that not only prove to be totally useless but also can cause serious health problems. USDrugs is one of very few Internet drugstores that always offer only 100% generic meds.
Don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions concerning the information provided.Please click here for more information.
With Best Regards,  Eddie Pierson
USDrugs B.V.
