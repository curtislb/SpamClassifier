        Dear Reader,

        As the Homeland Defense arena continues to grow, public
        companies are using technology employed in other
        aspects of their business for Homeland Defense
        purposes.  It makes sense for many of these companies
        to use technology previously created for other
        applications in the now booming Homeland Defense
        sector.

        Companies such as Positron Corporation (OTCBB:POSC)
        illustrate this model.  The imaging technology company
        recently announced that through its R&D affiliate, it
        has filed a provisional patent on a device that is
        capable of detecting illicit radioactive sources at a
        distance. (Please see their NEWS below)

        Positron Corporation engages in the design,
        manufacture, marketing, and servicing of advanced
        medical imaging devices utilizing positron emission
        tomography (PET) technology.  You may view a complete

         Positron Expands on Its Entry into Radiation Detection
                                Devices
                   for Homeland Security Applications

        HOUSTON, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Positron Corporation
        (OTCBB:POSC - News), through its research and
        development affiliate, has filed a provisional patent
        on a device that is capable of detecting illicit
        radioactive sources at a distance. The processes and
        techniques utilized in the development of the radiation
        detection devices arose as a result of Positron's long
        history in the field of medical imaging and positron
        emission mammography ("PET") scanners. A PET ("Positron
        Emission Tomography") scanner is a sensitive radiation
        detection device that detects cancer-seeking
        radiopharmaceuticals injected into the human body. PET
        scanners operate at close distances to the body.
        Radiation detection devices for Homeland Security must
        be able to detect potential nuclear threats at much
        lower dose levels than used in PET and in a much
        shorter time period, from as far as 100 meters away.

        The Positron team was led by Irving Weinberg M.D.,
        Ph.D., and included a team of academic scientists
        working in the fields of medical imaging, nuclear
        non-proliferation, radiation surveillance, high energy
        physics, and program management. Dr. Weinberg was the
        inventor of two devices now commonly used for
        functional breast imaging of thousands of women
        annually (i.e., scintimammography and positron emission
        mammography). Dr. Weinberg was trained at the National
        Institutes of Health, the Johns Hopkins Hospital, and
        UCLA (where he worked with Dr. Ed Hoffman and Dr.
        Michael Phelps, the inventors of the PET scanner). Dr.
        Weinberg previously founded the first company to take
        advantage of the clinical abilities of high-resolution
        PET for organ-specific imaging (Naviscan PET Systems,
        Inc.), and to market these products to surgeons as well
        as radiologists. Dr. Weinberg's current effort has been
        to engineer a high-level upgrade of Positron's current
        PET scanner technology, and to discover new
        applications for these emerging products.

        The new stand-off radiation scanner (SORAC)
        incorporates proprietary state-of-the-art solid-state
        photodetectors developed by the Positron affiliate's
        scientific team. These detectors are the key to the
        miniaturization and overall effectiveness of global
        nuclear detection architecture. Unlike competing
        technologies (i.e., High-Purity Germanium), the
        solid-state detectors do not require cooling, and hence
        have greater mobility and substantially lower power
        requirements. The photodetectors cost much less than
        conventional high-resolution components (e.g.,
        multi-anode photomultipliers), which is an advantage
        for medical imaging as well as Homeland Security
        applications.

        Positron plans to finance the future development of
        this unique concept toward commercialization through
        separate project financing.

        or gamma camera, is a diagnostic medical imaging system
        that is part of a family of systems commonly referred
        to as .body scanners. Gamma cameras are used in the
        diagnosis of heart disease, cancers and a variety of
        other disorders. A mechanical frame (a gantry) rotates
        an electronic detector head around a patient in order
        to take a series of clinical images of inside of the
        body. The scientific team responsible for the design
        and continued innovation of the company’s world-class
        cameras comprise more than 125 years of expertise in

                      Target Market and Opportunity

        Cardiac PET technology has been available to users for
        the past decade. The Cardiac PET user base has
        increased 200% over the past 36 months. Positron is
        ideally positioned to enter the market with affordable
        PET and PET / CT systems, and a software solution
        package that will be sold for significantly less than
        competing vendors.

        Estimated annual sales of both PET and SPECT systems
        combined globally are $400,000,000.  Positron will
        target 5,000 community hospitals in the US enabling
        them to offer this life-saving technology, coupled with
        unique software solutions at an unprecedented
        affordable price. Positron believes that the software
        will be desired by existing PET users, who choose to
        add new services to their center, as well as compliment
        the new PET only device. Positron expects to receive
        annual software licensing revenues to diversify revenue
        channels.

               “As anatomical images reach a limit in what
                they can reveal, PET's ability to look at
                              underlying
               biological processes is just starting to be
                                tapped.”

                       PET MARKETING and POSITRON

             * Positron Corporation (POSC) is the First
             Name in PET and a pioneer in Positron
             Emission Tomography.

             * Positron is the #1 provider of PET for
             Cardiac imaging.  Positron's software and
             hardware are optimized for Cardiac.

             * The cardiac disease market is 500% larger
             than the oncology market at $400 Billion
             spent per year on cardiac treatment.

             * Positron is able to reduce their camera
             capital costs through the joint venture with
             Neusoft Corporation which is contradictory to
             the larger competition business strategies.

             * In the past 12-18 months the Cardiac PET
             market has come to the forefront of the PET
             industry due to medical insurance
             reimbursement and a shift to a better
             diagnostic modality for cardiac disease by
             the medical profession.

             * This shift comes through a greater
             understanding by the medical community of the
             clinical benefits using PET, the aging global
             population in need of this superior
             diagnostic modality, and most recently the
             increase in reimbursement (up 300%) for PET
             procedures.

             * With PET being the better diagnostic
             modality for cardiac and the lowest price PET
             and PET/CT we believe Positron will make a
             significant impact on the approximately
             14,000,000 annual SPECT procedure market as
             it shifts to the more effective PET
             diagnostic modality.

            Positron Subsidiary Files Patent Applications for
         Proprietary Radiation Detection Technologies To Be Used
              in PET Scanners and Homeland Security Devices

        HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Positron Corporation (OTCBB:
        POSC - News; the Company), a developer and manufacturer
        of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) medical devices,
        announced today that through its subsidiary developed
        intellectual property in the field of solid state photo
        detection and its applications. The Company has four
        patents pending covering the design and construction of
        medical diagnostic molecular imaging scanners and
        radiation detection scanners for homeland security with
        its new class of solid state photodetectors. The
        compact, low-cost photodetectors have increased
        sensitivity that can detect a single quantum of light
        and may significantly reduce the cost of future PET
        scanners while improving spatial resolution and
        portability. Solid state photodetectors are the key
        component in the development of compact organ-specific
        PET scanners and effective radiation detection devices
        for monitoring of radiation proliferation by parties
        unfriendly to national security interests. The
        Company's research and development projects were
        conducted at facilities across North America with the
        participation of a team of collaborating scientists
        directed by Dr. Irving Weinberg. Dr. Weinberg is Chief
        Scientific Officer of the Positron research and
        development subsidiary.

        The miniaturization afforded with this solid state
        photodetector technology is designed as the evolution
        of positron emission technologies that will enable the
        development of the next generation of efficient and
        economical full-body scanning devices, integrated
        PET/MRI scanners and the development of a single-use
        organ specific low-cost camera that can be disposed of
        after a single medical procedure.

        The homeland security application is based on the
        ability to build a small transportable device using the
        compact solid state technology to detect very low
        levels of radiation emitted by illicit radioactive
        materials from a distance.

        Dr. Irving Weinberg stated: "The solid state
        photodetectors will allow us to build radiation
        detection systems with high sensitivity. In new medical
        diagnostic nuclear imaging systems it will allow
        reduced patient radiation exposure because of lower
        radiopharmaceutical dosage, while in the homeland
        security application, a small radiation event can be
        detected from a substantial distance".

        In the report Ms. Springer writes, "Positron designs,
        manufactures, sells, and services competitively-priced
        Positron Emission Tomography ("PET") scanners. These
        scanners are used to diagnose, stage, and treat
        critical illnesses such as cancer, coronary disease and
        neurological disorders, such as Dementia, Alzheimer's
        and Parkinson's disease. Positron is positioning to be
        a leader in providing end users total disease
        solutions. Their business plan is currently focused on
        introducing an innovative coronary disease reversal and
        prevention solutions package. The timing of this
        package is very opportunistic in light of the
        governments focus on healthcare dollars as well as the
        aging of the highly educated baby boomer population."

        "Positron's competitors in the PET scanner market
        include Siemens (NYSE:SI - News), GE Healthcare
        (NYSE:GE - News), Philips Medical Systems, and Hitachi
        Medical Systems (NYSE: HIT - News). Positron plans to
        compete by manufacturing and marketing a more
        cost-competitive scanner. The Company has formed an R&D
        and manufacturing joint venture with Neusoft Medical
        Systems, one of China's largest medical device
        companies."

<p>Dear Reader,
<p>As the Homeland Defense arena continues to grow, public companies are
using technology employed in other aspects of their business for Homeland
Defense purposes.&nbsp; It makes sense for many of these companies to use
technology previously created for other applications in the now booming
Homeland Defense sector.
<p>Companies such as <b>Positron Corporation (OTCBB:POSC)</b> illustrate
this model.&nbsp; The imaging technology company recently announced that
through its R&amp;D affiliate, it has filed a provisional patent on a device
that is capable of detecting illicit radioactive sources at a distance.
(<i>Please see their </i><b><font color="#CC0000">NEWS</font></b><i> below</i>)
<p>Positron Corporation engages in the design, manufacture, marketing,
and servicing of advanced medical imaging devices utilizing positron emission
tomography (PET) technology.&nbsp; <b>You may view a complete StockUpTicks

<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">Positron Expands on Its Entry into
Radiation Detection Devices&nbsp;</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">for Homeland Security Applications</font></b></center>

<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>HOUSTON, Texas--(BUSINESS
WIRE)--Positron Corporation (OTCBB:POSC - News)</font></font></b><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>,
through its research and development affiliate, has filed a provisional
patent on a device that is capable of detecting illicit radioactive sources
at a distance. The processes and techniques utilized in the development
of the radiation detection devices arose as a result of Positron's long
history in the field of medical imaging and positron emission mammography
("PET") scanners. A PET ("Positron Emission Tomography") scanner is a sensitive
radiation detection device that detects cancer-seeking radiopharmaceuticals
injected into the human body. PET scanners operate at close distances to
the body. Radiation detection devices for Homeland Security must be able
to detect potential nuclear threats at much lower dose levels than used
in PET and in a much shorter time period, from as far as 100 meters away.</font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>The Positron team was
led by Irving Weinberg M.D., Ph.D., and included a team of academic scientists
working in the fields of medical imaging, nuclear non-proliferation, radiation
surveillance, high energy physics, and program management. Dr. Weinberg
was the inventor of two devices now commonly used for functional breast
imaging of thousands of women annually (i.e., scintimammography and positron
emission mammography). Dr. Weinberg was trained at the National Institutes
of Health, the Johns Hopkins Hospital, and UCLA (where he worked with Dr.
Ed Hoffman and Dr. Michael Phelps, the inventors of the PET scanner). Dr.
Weinberg previously founded the first company to take advantage of the
clinical abilities of high-resolution PET for organ-specific imaging (Naviscan
PET Systems, Inc.), and to market these products to surgeons as well as
radiologists. Dr. Weinberg's current effort has been to engineer a high-level
upgrade of Positron's current PET scanner technology, and to discover new
applications for these emerging products.</font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>The new stand-off radiation
scanner (SORAC) incorporates proprietary state-of-the-art solid-state photodetectors
developed by the Positron affiliate's scientific team. These detectors
are the key to the miniaturization and overall effectiveness of global
nuclear detection architecture. Unlike competing technologies (i.e., High-Purity
Germanium), the solid-state detectors do not require cooling, and hence
have greater mobility and substantially lower power requirements. The photodetectors
cost much less than conventional high-resolution components (e.g., multi-anode
photomultipliers), which is an advantage for medical imaging as well as
Homeland Security applications.</font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>Positron plans to finance
the future development of this unique concept toward commercialization
through separate project financing.</font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>About Positron:</font></font>

Billion spent per year on cardiac treatment.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#33CCFF"><font size=+1>*</font> </font></b>Positron
is able to reduce their camera capital costs through the joint venture
with <b>Neusoft Corporation</b> which is contradictory to the larger competition
business strategies.&nbsp;
<p><b><font color="#33CCFF"><font size=+1>*</font></font></b> In the past
12-18 months the Cardiac PET market has come to the forefront of the PET
industry <i>due to medical insurance reimbursement</i> and a <font color="#00CC00">shift</font>
to a better diagnostic modality for cardiac disease by the medical profession.&nbsp;
<p><b><font color="#33CCFF"><font size=+1>*</font></font></b> This <font color="#00CC00">shift</font>
comes through a greater understanding by the medical community of the clinical
benefits using PET, the aging global population in need of this superior
diagnostic modality, and most recently <i>the increase in reimbursement
(up 300%) for PET procedures.</i>
<p><b><font color="#33CCFF"><font size=+1>*</font></font></b> With PET
being the better diagnostic modality for cardiac and the lowest price PET
and PET/CT we believe Positron will make a significant impact on the approximately
<b>14,000,000</b>
annual SPECT procedure market as it shifts to the more effective PET diagnostic
modality.</blockquote>

Applications for Proprietary Radiation Detection Technologies To Be Used
in PET Scanners and Homeland Security Devices</font></b></center>

<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>HOUSTON--(BUSINESS
WIRE)--Positron Corporation (OTCBB: POSC - News; the Company)</font></font></b><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>,
a developer and manufacturer of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) medical
devices, announced today that through its subsidiary developed intellectual
property in the field of solid state photo detection and its applications.
The Company has four patents pending covering the design and construction
of medical diagnostic molecular imaging scanners and radiation detection
scanners for homeland security with its new class of solid state photodetectors.
The compact, low-cost photodetectors have increased sensitivity that can
detect a single quantum of light and may significantly reduce the cost
of future PET scanners while improving spatial resolution and portability.
Solid state photodetectors are the key component in the development of
compact organ-specific PET scanners and effective radiation detection devices
for monitoring of radiation proliferation by parties unfriendly to national
security interests. The Company's research and development projects were
conducted at facilities across North America with the participation of
a team of collaborating scientists directed by Dr. Irving Weinberg. Dr.
Weinberg is Chief Scientific Officer of the Positron research and development
subsidiary.</font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>The miniaturization afforded
with this solid state photodetector technology is designed as the evolution
of positron emission technologies that will enable the development of the
next generation of efficient and economical full-body scanning devices,
integrated PET/MRI scanners and the development of a single-use organ specific
low-cost camera that can be disposed of after a single medical procedure.</font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>The homeland security
application is based on the ability to build a small transportable device
using the compact solid state technology to detect very low levels of radiation
emitted by illicit radioactive materials from a distance.</font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>Dr. Irving Weinberg stated:
"The solid state photodetectors will allow us to build radiation detection
systems with high sensitivity. In new medical diagnostic nuclear imaging
systems it will allow reduced patient radiation exposure because of lower
radiopharmaceutical dosage, while in the homeland security application,
a small radiation event can be detected from a substantial distance".</font></font>

and services competitively-priced Positron Emission Tomography ("PET")
scanners. These scanners are used to diagnose, stage, and treat critical
illnesses such as cancer, coronary disease and neurological disorders,
such as Dementia, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Positron is positioning
to be a leader in providing end users total disease solutions. Their business
plan is currently focused on introducing an innovative coronary disease
reversal and prevention solutions package. The timing of this package is
very opportunistic in light of the governments focus on healthcare dollars
as well as the aging of the highly educated baby boomer population."</font></font></font>
