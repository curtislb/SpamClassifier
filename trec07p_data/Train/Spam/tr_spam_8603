Hi, Robert

If there could be a chance for me to build a strong and friendly family, I wouldn't have any shadow of doubt of doing that.  Life is just, I believe in that, so I kept my love and my heart untouched for a real gentleman.  Now I would be very happy to find out that this gentleman is You.  I hope for honesty, I can't demand this, but I at least hope that you will be honest with me and that I can trust you fully.  I am eager to read you at http://foundthelove.com/caress  If you will not answer me soon, I certainly will be disappointed…


Looking forward to get a letter from you
Olechka
