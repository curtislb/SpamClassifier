 I am Mr. Chen Yuan, a foreign operations manager of the BANK OF 
CHINA,HONG KONG. 

I have a obscured business suggestion for you.On May 6 ,2002, an Iraqi 
Oil consultant/contractor with the Chinese  Petroleum and Chemical 
corporation. Major Fadi Basem made a numbered time(Fixed) Deposit for  
twelve calendar months, valued at US$8,000,000.00  (Eight Million  
Dollars only) in my branch.  

Upon maturity, I sent a routine  notification to his forwarding 
address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and 
finally we discovered from his contract employers,  the Hong Kong 
Petroleum and Chemical Corporation that the Major and his family had 
been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.

On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a 
WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. And he 
also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one 
except me knew of his deposit in my bank

I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Major. 
Bassem did not declare any kin or relations in all his official 
documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum 
of US$8,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is 
being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No 
one will ever come forward  to claim it.  

According to Laws of Hong Kong, at the expiration of 5(Five) years, 
the money will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if 
nobody applies to claim the fund. 

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to 
stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Fadi Bassem so that the fruits of 
this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt 
government officials. 

This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names 
and addresss that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents 
and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. 

I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we 
shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will 
prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of 
kin to Mr Bassem. 

The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio 
of 50% for me and 45% for you and 5% for  any Expenses Incurred in the 
course of the transaction. 

There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will 
be done by the attorney and with my position as the foreign operations 
manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. 


Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details that 
will help you understand the transaction. 

You should observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this 
transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall 
require your assistance to invest my share in your country. 

Awaiting your urgent reply to my very private email address 
chen_gyuan5@yahoo.com.hk . 

Thanks and regards.
