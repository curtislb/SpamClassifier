    Deadly nightshade  or  belladonna   [[Atropa]] belladonna  is a well known
perennial shrub, with leaves and berries that are highly toxic. It is in the
nightshade family  [[Solanaceae]] , which it shares with potatoes, tomatoes,
eggplants, jimsonweed, tobacco, and chili peppers. In addition, [[Solanum
nigrum]] is also called Deadly nightshade.

The Belladonna is native to Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia, and has
become naturalized in parts of North America. It is not nearly as common in the
wild as many field guides would suggest. This is because it is readily attacked
by mint flea beetles Longitarsus waterhousei and has a low tolerance for direct
sunlight. In areas where it has become naturalized it can often be found in
shady, moist areas with a limestone rich soil.

Description

The Belladonna has dull green leaves and bell shaped flowers that are an
unremarkable shade of purple, which yield black, shiny berries measuring
approximately 1 cm in diameter. The berries are sweet, but most of their
alkaloids are in the seed. It is an herbaceous shrub, and can grow to be
approximately one metre tall. The leaves have an oily,  poison ivy  like feel
and can cause vesicular pustular eruptions if handled carelessly. Many animals,
such as rabbits, birds and deer, seem to eat the plant without suffering harmful
effects, though dogs and cats are affected. Many reports suggest that people
have been poisoned by eating animals which have previously eaten Belladonna,
though this has not been verified.

Germination is often difficult due to the presence of germination inhibitors in
the seeds. Belladonna is not common as a garden plant, and is considered a weed
in some areas. It is not a very hardy perennial and is sensitive to being
transplanted. Germination requires several weeks in warm, moist, absolutely
sterile soil, usually far from normal garden conditions.

Toxicity

Belladonna is one of the most toxic plants found in the Western hemisphere.
Children have been poisoned by eating as few as three berries. Ingestion of a
leaf of the Belladonna can be fatal to an adult. The root of the plant is
generally the most toxic part, though this can vary from one specimen to
another.

All parts of the plant contain tropane alkaloids. The berries pose the greatest
danger to children because they look attractive and have a somewhat sweet taste.
Symptoms of belladonna poisoning are the same as those for atropine  the best 
known of the tropane alkaloids , and include dilated pupils, tachycardia,
hallucinations, blurred vision, loss of balance, a feeling of flight,
staggering, a sense of suffocation, paleness followed by a red rash, flushing,
husky voice, extremely dry throat, constipation, urinary retention, and
confusion. The skin can completely dry out and slough off. Fatal cases have a
rapid pulse that turns feeble. The antidote is physostigmine or pilocarpine, the
same as for atropine.

The reason for most of these symptoms is atropine s effect on the
parasympathetic nervous system. Atropine competitively inhibits the action of
acetylcholine  ACh  at the acetylcholine receptor in the nerve synapse, thereby
preventing the parasympathetic nervous system from sending out electrical nerve
impulses. Since the parasympathetic nervous system regulates non 
volitional subconscious activities  such as sweating, breathing, and heart rate 
when it is prevented from sending out signals, the heartbeat and breathing
become extremely irregular.

The Belladonna is toxic to many domestic animals and livestock  Belladonna
poisoning can lead to colic, depression, weakness, and lack of coordination in
horses, with fatalities reported even for small amounts from 1 to 10 pounds  0.5
to 5 kg .

Uses Cosmetics The name belladonna originates from the historic use by women
 Bella Donna is Italian for beautiful lady  to dilate their pupils  an extract
of belladonna was used as eye drops as part of their makeup preparations. The
Belladonna toxin s atropine content had the effect of dilating the pupil, thus
making their eyes supposedly more attr</STYLE>
