DEAREST,

MY NAME IS MR.EDWARD LAMPTEY

I AM WRITING IN RESPECT OF A FOREIGN CUSTOMER OF MY BANK PAUL PHILLIP,WHO PERISHED IN AN AUTO ACCIDENT WITH HIS ENTIRE FAMILY IN OCTOBER
1999.

SIR/MADAM, SINCE THE DEMISE OF PAUL PHILLIP, I PERSONALLY HAVE WATCHED
WITH KEEN INTEREST TO SEE THE NEXT OF KIN BUT ALL HAS PROVED ABORTIVE AS NO
ONE HAS COME TO CLAIM HIS FUNDS OF USD12.5M,[TWELVE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED
THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS]HAS BEEN WITH OUR BANK HERE FOR A VERY LONG
TIME.

ON THIS NOTE I DECIDED TO SEEK FOR WHOM HIS NAME SHALL BE USED AS THE
NEXT OF KIN, AS NO ONE HAS COME UP TO PUT CLAIM AS THE NEXT OF KIN TO THIS
FUNDS AND THE BANKING ETHICS HERE DOES NOT ALLOW SUCH MONEY TO STAY MORE THAN
SEVEN YEARS, BECAUSE AFTER SEVEN YEARS THE MONEY WILL BE CALLED BACK TO THE
BANK TREASURY AS UNCLAIMED BILL.

IN VIEW OF THIS I GOT YOUR CONTACT THROUGH MY COUNTRY'S FOREIGN TRADE
MISSION AFTER I WAS CONVINCED IN MY MIND THAT YOUR NAME/COMPANY COULD BE USED
AS THE NEXT OF KIN TO THIS CLAIM. THE REQUEST OF THE FOREIGNER AS A NEXT OF
KIN THIS BUSINESS IS OCCASIONED BY THE FACT THAT THE CUSTOMER WAS A FOREIGNER
AND A GHANAIAN CANNOT STAND AS THE NEXT OF KIN TO A FOREIGNER.

I AGREED THAT 30% OF THIS MONEY WILL BE FOR YOU AS A FOREIGN PARTNER IN
RESPECT OF PROVIDING AN ACCOUNT WHILE 10% WILL TAKE CARE OF ANY
EXPENSES THAT MIGHT BE INCURRED IN THE PROCESS OF TRANSFERRING THIS FUNDS AND
THE REST WILL BE FOR ME AND MY COLLEAGUE THEREAFTER I WILL VISIT YOUR COUNTRY
FOR DISBURSEMENT AS I AM ALMOST DUE FOR RETIREMENT.

UPON THE RECEIPT OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE, I WILL SEND YOU BY FAX OR E-MAIL A
DRAFT APPLICATION OF CLAIM WHICH YOU WILL SEND TO THE BANK AS THE NEXT OF KIN
AND THE NEXT STEP TO TAKE.

I WILL NOT FAIL TO BRING TO YOUR NOTICE THAT THIS BUSINESS IS HITCH
FREE AND THAT YOU SHOULD NOT ENTERTAIN ANY FEAR AS THE WHOLE REQUIRED
ARRANGEMENT HAS BEEN PERFECTED FOR THE TRANSFER.

PLEASE SEND ME THE FOLLOWING INFORMATIONS:

1, FULL NAME

2, ADDRESSES

3, PHONE NUMBER

4, OCCUPATION

5 DATES OF BIRTH



HOPING TO HEAR FROM YOU.

REGARDS,
MR.EDWARD LAMPTEY
