    Carthage   , from the Phoenician   lang/phn Latn/Kart hadasht   meaning new
town, ,   refers both to an ancient city in North Africa located in modern day
Tunis and to the civilization that developed within the city s sphere of
influence. The city of Carthage was located on the eastern side of Lake Tunis
across from the center of modern Tunis in Tunisia.

Settlement Originally a settlement of Phoenician colonists, Carthage grew into a
vast economic and political power throughout the Mediterranean Sea, accumulating
wealth and influence through its economic  trading  prowess. Carthage was a
major power of the Mediterranean, contemporaneously with the Roman Republic of
the 3rd and 2nd century BC, and was its rival for dominance of the western
Mediterranean. Eventually this rivalry led to a series of three wars known as
the Punic Wars, each of which Carthage lost. These losses led to a decline in
Carthage s political and economic strength, mostly due to the harsh penalties
imposed on Carthage by Rome as conditions for the cessation of hostilities. The
Third Punic War ended with the complete destruction of the city of Carthage and
the annexation of the last remnants of Carthaginian territory by Rome. Distinct
Carthaginian civilization ceased to exist, but remnants contributed to later
Mediterranean cultures.

The name Carthage is derived by way of Greek and Latin dialects from the
Phoenician   transl/phn/qart    ada  t   meaning  new city.  More than one
Phoenician settlement originally bore this name, although only one city has the
distinction of being the Carthage of the ancient world.

While the term Carthaginian is used by many modern writers, many ancient
writings used the adjective Punic to describe anything to do with Carthaginian
civilization, because of the Latin term   lang/la/Punicus    earlier
  lang/la/Poenicus   , itself borrowed from Greek ,  Phoenicia. 

Question of Carthage

The historical study of Carthage is problematic. Due to the subjugation of the
civilization by the Romans at the end of the Third Punic War, very few
Carthaginian historical primary sources survive. There are a few ancient
translations of Punic texts into Greek and Latin, as well as inscriptions on
monuments and buildings discovered in North Africa. ref   cite web

    ref  However, the majority of available primary source material about
Carthaginian civilization was written by Greek and Roman historians, such as
Livy, Polybius, Appian, Cornelius Nepos, Silius Italicus, Plutarch, Dio Cassius,
and Herodotus.

These authors participated in cultures which were nearly always in competition,
and often in conflict, with Carthage. The Greeks contested with Carthage for
Sicily, ref Herodotus, V2. 165   7  ref  for instance, and the Romans fought the
Punic Wars against Carthage. ref Polybius, World History  1.7   1.60  ref 
Inevitably the accounts of Carthage written by outsiders include significant
bias.

Recent excavation of ancient Carthaginian sites has brought much more primary
material to light. Some of these finds contradict or confirm aspects of the
traditional picture of Carthage, but much of the material is still ambiguous.

Foundation of Carthage Carthage was founded in 814 BC by Phoenician settlers
from the city of Tyre, bringing with them the city god Melqart. According to
tradition, the city was founded by Queen Dido  or Elissa or Elissar  who fled
Tyre following the murder of her husband in an attempt by her younger brother of
bolstering his own power. A number of foundation myths have survived through
Greek and Roman literature, see Byrsa for one example.

In 509 BC a treaty was signed between Carthage and Rome indicating a division of
influence and commercial activities. This is the first known source indicating
that Carthage had gained control over Sicily and Sardinia.

By the beginning of the 5th century BC, Carthage had become the commercial
center of the West Mediterranean region, a position it retained until overthrown
by the Roman Republic. The city had conquered most of the old Phoenician
colonies e.g. Hadrumetum, Utica and Kerkouane, subjugated the Libyan tribes, and
taken control of the entire North African coast from modern Morocco to the
borders of Egypt. Its influence had also extended into the Mediterranean, </STYLE>
