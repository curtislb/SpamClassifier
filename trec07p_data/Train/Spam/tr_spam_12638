 Holland  is a region in the central western part of the Netherlands with 6.07
million inhabitants. Holland is a former county of the Holy Roman Empire, ruled
by the Count of Holland and later the dominant province of the Republic of the
Seven United Provinces 1581 ndash 1795.



Geography The name Holland is derived from holtland   wooded land  . Popular,
but incorrect, etymology holds that it is derived from hol land   hollow land  ,
inspired by the low lying geography of both the Dutch Holland and the English
region  Holland, Lincolnshire . Apart from coastal dunes most of the surface
consists of polder landscape, lying well below sea level and only kept from
flooding by continuous drainage, for which in earlier centuries the typical
Dutch windmills were used.

In recent millennia the geography of the region has been extremely dynamic with
the western coastline shifting up to thirty kilometres to the east, the Frisian
Isles becoming detached from the north of Holland and the main Rhine and Maas
rivers changing their course repeatedly and dramatically. In the last thousand
years this process has been complicated by human activities. Behind the row of
coastal dunes a large and high peat plateau had grown, protecting the land
against the sea. In the tenth century this area was brought under cultivation 
the drainage had extreme soil shrinkage as result, lowering the surface up to
fifteen metres. In Zealand and Frisia this led to catastrophic storm floods
literally washing away entire regions and the sea hollowed Holland out from
behind, forming the Zuiderzee. Only drastic administrative intervention saved
the county from utter destruction. The Counts and large monastries took the lead
in this, building the first really heavy emergency dykes to bolster critical
points. Later special administrative bodies were formed, the [[waterschap]]pen
  waterscapes  , with the power to enforce on penalty of death any decision they
made regarding water management. They constructed an extensive dyke system with
complete coverage of all polders, protecting the land from further incursions by
the sea. From the 16th century onward, the Hollanders took the offensive and
began land reclamation programmes, making polders of many lakes. As a result of
all this historical maps bear little resemblance to the present situation.

The area is today divided between two provinces of the Netherlands  North
Holland  Noord Holland  and South Holland  Zuid Holland  that were created in
1840, and make up roughly 13  of the area of the Netherlands. A few regions that
were historically Hollandic became part of other provinces as a result of
reforms during the French occupation  1795 1813 . Willemstad and surroundings,
the Biesbosch and the Land van Altena became eventually part of North Brabant in
1818. In 1940, after the Battle of the Netherlands the Germans ordered the
islands of Vlieland and Terschelling to go to Friesland. This was not changed
back after World War II. In 1950, the island of Urk went to Overijssel  in 1986
to Flevoland . More recent territorial changes are the transfer of Oudewater,
Woerden and Vianen from South Holland to the province of Utrecht, in 1970, 1989
and 2002 respectively.

History County Holland Holland arose as a county of the Holy Roman Empire in the
9th century. The Counts of Holland were also counts of Hainaut, Flanders and
Zealand for several periods in the 13th 15th century. In this time a part of
Frisia, West Friesland, was conquered and as a result most provincial
institutions would for centuries bear the epithet  of Holland and West Frisia ,
such as the States of Holland and West Frisia. In 1432 Holland became part of
the Burgundian Netherlands and since 1477 of the Habsburg Seventeen Provinces.
In the 16th century the region became densely urbanised, with the majority of
the population living in cities.

In the Dutch Rebellion against the Habsburgs during the Eighty Years  War, the
naval forces of the rebels, the Watergeuzen, established their first permanent
base in 1572 in the Hollandic city of Brill. This way Holland became the centre
of the rebellion and as a result the cultural, political and economic centre of
the United Province</STYLE>
