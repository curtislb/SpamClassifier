Turin pronunce T[y]r   n  is a major industrial city as well as a business and
cultural centre in northern Italy, capital of the Piedmont region, located
mainly on the west bank of the Po River. The population of the city of Turin is
908,000  2004 census   its metropolitan area totals about 1.7 million
inhabitants. The province is one of the largest in Italy, with 6,830 km    2,637
sq. mi , and one of the most populous, with 2,236,941 inhabitants at the 2004
census. Turin is well known as the home of the Shroud of Turin, headquarters of
Fiat automobile manufacturer and host of the 2006 Winter Olympics. It was the
first capital of Italy.

History The name of Turin comes from Tau, a Celtic word that means mountains.
Its Italian name, Torino, translates as  little bull   hence the coat of arms
and the symbol of the city. The area was settled by the Taurini in pre Roman
times.

In the 1st century BC  probably 28 BC , the Romans created a military camp
 Castra Taurinorum , later dedicated to Augustus  Augusta Taurinorum . The
typical Roman street grid can still be seen in the modern city. Turin reached
about 5,000 inhabitants at the time, all living inside the high walls.

After the fall of the Roman empire the city was conquered by the Lombards, then
the Franks  in 942 the [[Contea di Torino]]   Countship of Turin , also known as
March , was founded, since 1050 held by the family of the  then  Counts of
Savoy. While the dignity of count was held by the Bishop as conte di Turino, 1092 
1130 and 1136   1191, it was ruled as a prince bishopric by the Bishops. It was
a lordship 1230   1235 under the Marchese di Monferrato, styled Signore di
Torino   Lord  

At the end of the 13th century, when it was annexed to the Duchy of Savoy, the
city already had 20,000 inhabitants. Many of the gardens and palaces were built
in the 15th century when the city was redesigned. The University was also
founded during this period.

Emanuele Filiberto  Iron Head  made Turin the capital of the Duchy of Savoy in
1563. Piazza San Carlo, via Po and the Royal Palace  Palazzo Reale  were built
in this period.

In 1706 the French besieged the city for 117 days without conquering it  Battle
of Turin . After the subsequent Treaty of Utrecht, the Kingdom of Sardinia was
annexed to the Duchy of Savoy and the architect Filippo Juvarra began a major
redesign of the city. Now the capital of a European kingdom, Turin had about
90,000 inhabitants at the time.

In the 19th century, after brief occupation by Napoleon, the city began to
actively pursue the unification of Italy. In 1871, the Fr  jus Tunnel was
opened, making Turin an important communication node. The city now had 250,000
inhabitants. The Museo Egizio, the Mole Antonelliana, the Gran Madre church and
Vittorio Veneto square were built in this period.

In 1861, Turin became the capital of the newly proclaimed United Italy. In 1864
the capital was moved to Florence.  Since 1870 the capital has been Rome.  Turin
reacted to the loss of importance by beginning a rapid industrialisation  in
1899 FIAT was founded and Lancia in 1906. The Universal Exposition held in Turin
in 1902 is often considered the pinnacle of Art Nouveau design, and the city
hosted the Exposition again in 1911. By this time, Turin had grown to 430,000
inhabitants.

After World War I conflicts between workers and industrialists began. The first
strikes took place and in 1920 the Lingotto factory was occupied.

After World War II Turin was rapidly rebuilt and its industries greatly
developed, which caused waves of immigration, largely from the southern regions
of Italy. The population reached 1 million in 1960 and peaked at 1.5 million in
1975. In the 1980s the first industrial crisis hit the city and its population
began to decline  and continues to, while the metropolitan area grows . The 2005
population is 908,000.

Law and government The mayor of Turin is directly elected every 5 years. Sergio
Chiamparino, the current mayor, belongs to the center left coalition.
