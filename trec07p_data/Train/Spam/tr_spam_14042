The term  oak  can be used as part of the common name of any of several hundred
species of trees and shrubs in the genus Quercus, and some related genera,
notably [[Cyclobalanopsis]] and [[Lithocarpus]]. The genus is native to the
northern hemisphere, and includes deciduous and evergreen species extending from
cold latitudes to tropical Asia and the Americas.

Oaks have spirally arranged leaves, with a lobed margin in many species  some
have serrated leaves or entire leaves with a smooth margin. The flowers are
catkins, produced in spring. The fruit is a nut called an acorn, borne in a cup 
like structure known as a cupule  each acorn contains one seed  rarely two or
three  and takes 6 18 months to mature, depending on species. The  live oaks 
 oaks with evergreen leaves  are not a distinct group, instead with their
members scattered among the sections below.

Classification The genus is divided into a number of sections   Sect. Quercus
 synonyms Lepidobalanus and Leucobalanus , the oaks of Europe, Asia and North
America. Styles short  acorns mature in 6 months, sweet or slightly bitter,
inside of acorn shell hairless. Leaves mostly lack a bristle on lobe tips, which
are usually rounded.  Sect. Mesobalanus, the Hungarian oak and its relatives of
Europe and Asia. Styles long  acorns mature in 6 months, bitter, inside of acorn
shell hairless  closely related to sect. Quercus and sometimes included in it .
 Sect. Cerris, the Turkey oak and its relatives of Europe and Asia. Styles long 
acorns mature in 18 months, very bitter, inside of acorn shell hairless. Leaves
typically have sharp lobe tips, with bristles at the lobe tip.  Sect.
Protobalanus, the Canyon live oak and its relatives, in southwest United States
and northwest Mexico. Styles short, acorns mature in 18 months, very bitter,
inside of acorn shell woolly. Leaves typically have sharp lobe tips, with
bristles at the lobe tip.  Sect. Lobatae  synonym Erythrobalanus , the red oaks
of North America, Central America and northern South America. Styles long,
acorns mature in 18 months, very bitter, inside of acorn shell woolly. Leaves
typically have sharp lobe tips, with spiny bristles at the lobe tip.

   Full list of   Quercus   species   

  Q. muhlenbergii  ]] Hybrids are common in oaks but usually only between
species within the same section  no verified inter section hybrids are known,
except between species of sections Quercus and Mesobalanus, where several occur.

The genus [[Cyclobalanopsis]], here treated as a distinct genus following the
[http   flora.huh.harvard.edu 8080 flora browse.do?flora_id 2 taxon_id 108828
Flora of China], is often included within Quercus as a distinct subgenus.

Uses Oaks are hardwood trees, and the wood is commonly used in furniture and
flooring. Oak wood has a density of about 0.75 g cm  .

The bark of Quercus suber, or Cork oak, is used to produce wine stoppers
 corks . This species grows in the Mediterranean Sea region, with Portugal,
Spain, Algeria and Morocco producing most of the world s supply. Some European
and American oak species are used to make barrels where wine and other spirits
are aged  the barrels, which are in some cases charred before use, contribute to
the taste, aroma, and color of the contents.

Of the North American oaks, the Northern red oak Quercus rubra is the most
prized of the red oak group for lumber, all of which is marketed as red oak
regardless of the species of origin. The standard for the lumber of the white
oak group, all of which is marketed as white oak, is the White Oak Quercus alba.
White Oak is often used to make wine barrels. The wood of Pedunculate Oak
Quercus robur and Sessile Oak Quercus petraea are extensively used in Europe.

The bark of the White Oak is dried and used in medical preparations. Oak bark is
also rich in tannin, and is used by tanners for tanning leather. Acorns are used
for making flour or roasted for acorn coffee. Oak galls were used for centuries
as the main ingredient in manuscript ink, harvested at a specific time of year.

Japanese oak is used in the making of professional drums from manufacturer
Yamaha Drums. The rough, hard surface of oak gives the drum a brighter and
louder tone compared to traditional drum materials such as maple and birch.

Cultivation Oak catkins are made up of small, yellowish green flowers. Acorns
appear after the female flowers are fertilized in spring. They are typically
brown, tan, yellow, light green, deep green or grayish green. Oaks grow slowly
and usually do not bear acorns until they are about 20 years old. Acorns require
stratification to stimulate sprouting. Most white oaks need immediate
stratification  species such as the Chestnut oak  Quercus montana  will sprout a
root upon falling and must have a suitable substrate for immediate rooting. Many
red oak acorns can be stratified for up to two years before sprouting. The life
span of oaks typically ran</STYLE>
