 Hyde Park  is one of the largest parks in central London and one of the Royal
Parks of London, famous for its Speakers  Corner.

The park is divided in two by the Serpentine Lake. The park is contiguous with
Kensington Gardens, which is widely assumed to be part of Hyde Park, but is
technically separate. Hyde Park is 350 acres  1.4 km    and Kensington Gardens
is 275 acres  1.1 km    giving an overall area of 625 acres  2.5 km   .

Hyde Park is also home to the New Zealand World War One memorial.

The park was the site of The Great Exhibition of 1851, for which the Crystal
Palace was designed by Joseph Paxton.

The park has become a traditional location for mass demonstrations. The
Chartists, the Suffragettes and the Stop The War Coalition have all held
protests in the park.

On 20 July 1982 in the Hyde Park and Regents Park bombings, two bombs linked to
the Provisional Irish Republican Army caused the death of eight members of the
Household Cavalry and the Royal Green Jackets and seven horses.

Grand Entrance


The Grand Entrance to the park, at Hyde Park Corner next to Apsley House, was
erected from the designs of Decimus Burton. It consists of a screen of handsome
fluted Ionic columns, with three carriage entrance archways, two foot entrances,
a lodge, etc. The extent of the whole frontage is about 107 ft  33 m . The
central entrance has a bold projection  the entablature is supported by four
columns  and the volutes of the capitals of the outside column on each side of
the gateway are formed in an angular direction, so as to exhibit two complete
faces to view. The two side gateways, in their elevations, present two insulated
Ionic columns, flanked by antae. All these entrances are finished by a blocking,
the sides of the central one being decorated with a beautiful frieze,
representing a naval and military triumphal procession. This frieze was designed
by Mr. Henning, junior, the son of Mr. Henning who was well known for his models
of the Elgin marbles.

The gates were manufactured by Messrs. Bramah. They are of iron, bronzed, and
fixed or hung to the piers by rings of gun metal. The design consists of a
beautiful arrangement of the Greek honeysuckle ornament  the parts being well
defined, and the raffles of the leaves brought out in a most extraordinary
manner.

Sites of interest Sites of interest in the park include Speakers  Corner
 located in the northeast corner near Marble Arch  and Rotten Row which is the
northern boundary of the site of the Crystal Palace. To the southeast is Hyde
Park Corner. South of the Serpentine Lake is the Diana, Princess of Wales
memorial, an oval stone ring fountain opened on 6 July 2004. A botanical
sensation is the bizarre upside down tree. Opposite Hyde Park corner stands one
of the grandest hotels in London, The Lanesborough, which offers its top suite
at   99,000 per night.

Stanhope Lodge at Stanhope Gate, demolished to widen Park Lane, was the home of
Samuel Parkes who won the Victoria Cross in the Charge of the Light Brigade.
Parkes was later Inspector of the Park Constables of the Park and died in the
Lodge on 14 November 1864.

The photography for the Beatles album [[Beatles for Sale]] was taken at Hyde
Park in autumn of 1964.

Hyde Park in fiction

In Volume II of Alan Moore s graphic novel, [[The League of Extraordinary
Gentlemen]], a character implies that Hyde Park is named in honour of Mr. Edward
Hyde, the bestial alter ego of Dr. Henry Jekyll, the titular character s  of
Robert Louis Stevenson s novella, [[The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde]]. This was a posthumous honour, done so to recognize Hyde s death while
attempting to stop invaders from the planet Mars in their advance upon London
 adapted from H. G. Wells  [[The War of the Worlds  novel /The War of the
Worlds]] . In this story, Hyde Park was originally named  Serpentine Park .

In [[The Face of Evil]]  a serial in the British science fiction television
series [[Doctor Who]] , The Doctor is attempting to reach Hyde Park when he
lands on an alien planet.

Hyde Park is also the setting for Anne Perry s Victorian murder mystery, [[The
Hyde Park Headsman]] in which several murder victims are found beheaded in or
