Dear valued member!
We are sure that your health isn’t the least thing you care of – so, please, read the valuable piece of advice our Association offers you.
This letter is NOT a piece of ad – we just want you to know that more 80% of the drugs you purchase on the Internet come from underground factories in southern Asia – so, apparently, no one can say that they are totally safe. The only drugstore that has managed to prove the quality of its meds so far is USDrugs.
Remember! Taking generic drugs you will secure yourself against poisoning!Please click here for more information.
With Best Regards,  Myles Michel
USDrugs B.V.
