History


The word  Tampa  is a Native American word used to refer to the area when the
first European explorers arrived in Florida. Its meaning is believed to be
 sticks of fire  in the language of the Calusa, a Native American tribe. Other
historians claim the name refers to  The place to gather sticks .  Sticks of
fire  may also relate to the high concentration of lightning strikes that Tampa
Bay receives every year during the hot and wet summer months.Toponymist George
R. Stewart writes that the name was the result of a miscommunication between the
Spanish and the Indians, the Indian word being  itimpi , meaning simply  near
it   Stewart, pg. 231 .

The name first appears in the  Memoir  of Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda
 1575 , the author of which had spent 17 years as a Calusa captive. He calls it
 Tanpa  and describes it as an important Calusa town. While  Tanpa  is the
apparent basis for the modern name  Tampa , archaeologist Jerald Milanich places
the Calusa village of Tanpa at the mouth of Charlotte Harbor, the original  Bay
of Tanpa . Later Spanish explorers, having failed to locate Charlotte Harbor,
assumed that the large bay they did find was the Bay of Tanpa, and the name
stuck with the current Tampa Bay. ref Milanich, Jerald T. 1995. Florida Indians
and the Invasion from Europe. University Press of Florida. ISBN 0 8130 1360 7 p.
40  ref 

In April of 1528, the ill fated Narv  ez Expedition landed near Tampa with the
intention of starting a colony. After being told by the natives of better riches
to the north, they abandoned their camp after only a week. A dozen years later,
a surviving member of the expedition named Juan Ortiz was rescued by Hernando de
Soto s expedition. ref [http   fcit.usf.edu FLORIDA docs d desoto.htm Floripedia
 De Soto, Hernando ]   URL retrieved January 30, 2007  ref  A peace treaty was
conducted with the local Indians and a short lived Spanish outpost was
established, but this was abandoned when it became clear that there was no gold
in the area, and that the local Indians were not interested in converting to
Catholicism and were too skilled as warriors to easily conquer.

When Great Britain acquired Florida in 1763, the bay was named Hillsborough Bay,
after Lord Hillsborough, Secretary of State for the Colonies.

Spain transferred Florida to the United States in 1821  see [[Adams On  s
Treaty]] . An Indian reservation was established in what is now North Tampa. As
part of efforts to firmly establish United States control over southern Florida,
then a vast swampy wilderness with sparse Seminole Indian population, a military
outpost   Cantonment Brooke   was established at what is now the Tampa
Convention Center in Downtown Tampa in 1823 by Colonels George Mercer Brooke and
James Gadsde</STYLE>
