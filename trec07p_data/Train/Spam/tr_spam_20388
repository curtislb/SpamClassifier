July 18
I just tried to connect to America online, which I've heard is the best online service I can get. I can't connect, I don't know what is wrong.<BR>
July 19
Some guy at the tech support center says my computer needs a modem. I don't see why. He's just trying to cheat me. How dumb does he think I am?<BR>
July 20
I bought the modem, I couldn't figure out where it goes though, it wouldn't fit in the monitor or the printer. I'm confused.<BR>
July 21
I finally got the modem in and hooked up. A three year old next door did it for me.<BR>
July 22
The three year old kid next door hooked me up to America online for me. He's so smart.<BR>
July 23
What the heck is the internet? I thought I was on America Online, not this internet thingy. I'm confused.<BR>
July 24
The three year old kid next door showed me how to use this America Online stuff. He must be a genius at least compared to me.<BR>
July 25
I tried to use chat today. I tried to talk into my computer but nothing happened. Maybe I need to buy a microphone.<BR>
July 26
I found this thingy called Usenet. I got out of it because I'm connected to America Online, not Usenet. I went to the doctor today for my regular checkup. He says that since I connected, My brain has mysteriously shrunk to half its normal size.<BR>
July 27
These people in this Usenet thingy keep using capital letters. How do they do that? i never figured out how to type capital letters. Maybe they have a different type of keyboard.<BR>
July 28
I found this thingy called the Usenet oracle. It says that it can answer any questions I ask it. I asked it 44 separate questions about the internet. I hope it responds soon.<BR>
July 29
I found a group called rec.humor. I decided to post this joke about why the chicken crossed the road. To get to the other side! ha ha! I wasn't sure if i posted it right so I posted it 56 more times.<BR>
July 30
I keep hearing about the World Wide Web. I didn't know spiders grew that large.<BR>
July 31
The oracle responded to my questions today. Geez, it was rude. I was so angry that I posted an angry message about it to rec.humor.oracle.d. I wasn't sure if it posted right so I posted it 22 more times.<BR>
August 1
Someone told me to read the FAQ. Geez, they didn't have to use profanity.<BR>
August 2
I just read this post called make money fast. I'm so exited, I'm going to make lots of money. I followed his instructions and posted it to every newsgroup i could find.<BR>
August 3
I just made my signature file. It's only 6 pages long, So I will have to work on it some more.<BR>
August 4
I just looked at a group called alt.aol.sucks. I read a few posts and I really believe that aol should be wiped off the face of the Earth. I wonder what an "aol" is, however.<BR>
August 5
I was asking where to find some information about something. Some guy told me to check out ftp.netcom.com. I've looked and looked, but I cant find that group.<BR>
August 6
Some guy suspended my account because of what i was doing. I told him I don't have an account at his bank. He's so dumb.
