Stock promotion group is in search of new partners in Germany
Busines proposal for stock owners

Hello stock owner,
We are a stock promotion company and we can promote any kind of stocks. We have been working on US market for 3 years. But now is is getting harder and harder to work on US market. We are in search of serious partners in Europe with whom we can make business together.That proposal is for you if you own a company and you want to promote it. We promote stocks by mass email advertising.

Stock owner

We can increase the price of your stock and we can increase average day trading volume. We can increase price up to 200-250% in 2-3 weeks and also we can increase volume by 10 times each trading day. You can sell almost any ammounts of shares. You don't have to pay anything in advance. First we increase the price and the volume, then you pay.

Payment: Our price for that is 10% from the daily volume. We count it by the following formula: last price * daily volume.

If you are interested in our proposal please write me back to the following email:
stockadvertiser1@yahoo.com
