 Samson ,  Shimshon   Hebrew                        ,  small Standard  small 
  im  on  small Tiberian  small    unicode/  im    n    meaning  of the sun     
perhaps proclaiming he was radiant and mighty, or  [One who] Serves [God]   or
 Shama un   Arabic  is the third to last of the Judges of the ancient Children
of Israel mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, the Tanakh. He is described in the Book
of Judges chapters 13 to 16. Interestingly, while there are many common prophets
in Jewish, Christian and Islamic discourse, stories about Samson are absent in
narratives from the Quran. Samson is something of a Herculean figure, utilizing
massive strength to combat his enemies and perform heroic feats unachievable by
ordinary men  wrestling a lion, slaying an entire army with nothing more than a
donkey s jawbone, and tearing down an entire building.

Biblical story



Samson lived when God was punishing the Israelites by giving them  into the hand
of the Philistines.  An angel from God appears to Manoah, an Israelite from the
tribe of Dan, in the city of Zorah, and to his wife, who is sterile. This angel
predicts that they will have a son who will begin to deliver the Israelites from
the Philistines. In accordance with Nazaritic requirements, she is to abstain
from all alcoholic beverages and all unclean meat, and her promised child is not
to shave or cut his hair. In due time the son, Samson, is born  he is reared
according to these provisions.

When he becomes a young man Samson leaves the hills of his people to see the
cities of the Philistines. While there, Samson becomes so infatuated with a
Philistine woman from Timnah that, overcoming the objections of his parents, he
decides to marry her. The intended marriage is actually part of God s plan to
strike at the Philistines. On the way to ask for the woman s hand in marriage,
Samson is attacked by a lion and kills it. He continues on to the Philistine s
house, winning her hand in marriage. On his way to the wedding, Samson notices
that bees have nested in the carcass of the lion and have made honey. He eats a
handful of the honey and gives some to his parents. At the wedding feast, Samson
proposes that he tell a riddle to his thirty groomsmen  all Philistines   if
they can solve it, he will give them thirty sets of clothes and undergarments.
The riddle   Out of the eater, something to eat  out of the strong, something
sweet.   is a veiled account of his second encounter with the lion  at which
only he was present . The Philistines are infuriated by the riddle.

The thirty groomsmen tell Samson s new wife that they will burn her and her
father s household if she does not discover the answer to the riddle. At the
urgent and tearful imploring of his bride, Samson tells her the solution, and
she tells it to the thirty groomsmen. Before sunset on the seventh day they said
to him,  What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a lion?  Samson
said to them,  If you had not plowed with my heifer, you would not have solved
my riddle.  He flies into a rage, kills thirty Philistines of Ashkelon for their
garments, which he gives his thirty groomsmen. Still in a rage, he returns to
his father s house, and his bride is given to the best man as his wife.

When Samson returns to Timnah, he finds his father in law has given his wife to
one of Samson s companions. Her father refuses to allow him to see her, and
wishes to give Samson the younger sister. Samson attaches torches to the tails
of three hundred fo</STYLE>
