        Dear Reader,

        Our lifestyle and nutritional choices in America are
        often dictated by sweeping trends, scientific studies
        and awareness - heightened by media coverage.  With so
        much published data on the rising incidence of obesity
        and diabetes - especially among children - as well as
        heart disease, cancer and a litany of other ailments
        affecting our society, its no wonder that Americans are
        trending away from the long-standing "soda pop"
        beverage industry leaders in favor of healthier
        alternatives that may even address many of the
        aforementioned diseases.

        Our featured company, Sweet Success Enterprises Inc.
        (OTCBB: SWTS), offers a full line of healthy and
        functional all-natural beverages made with
        ingredients focused on delivering endurance, heart
        health, and a natural energy boost.  As many of our
        readers know, we have an affinity for the alternative
        beverage market having published on several such
        companies including Clearly Canadian Beverage Corp.
        (OTCBB: CCBEF) for nearly two years.

        You need only walk through your local supermarket to
        realize that the alternative beverage marketplace is
        exploding, with energy and vitamin drinks taking up
        more store shelf real estate than ever in our
        history.   Sweet Success’ Fuel for Health™ beverages
        are bursting on the scene of a very accepting and
        vibrant marketplace. A profile on this exciting company
        is below.

        Sweet Success Enterprises, Inc. ("Sweet Success")
        ("SWTS) engages in the production, distribution, and
        marketing of ready-to-drink functional health beverages
        in the U.S. under the trademarked Fuel For Health™
        brand name targeting 4 to 64 year olds.  The
        fast-growing natural and wellness beverage market is
        now approaching $25 billion.

        San Antonio-based Sweet Success Enterprises Inc.
        acquired Nestlé’s original Sweet Success™ brand and has
        re-launched as Fuel for Health™; an all natural product
        line to tap into the rapidly growing demand for all
        natural and self stable health and wellness beverages.
        Sweet Success is now available in a growing number of
        stores and includes select ingredients to satiate,
        boost energy and immunity and enhance a healthy
        lifestyle. Sweet Success® contracts for the production,
        marketing and distribution of all-natural beverages
        under the brand names Sweet Success® Fuel For Health™.

        The Sweet Success product line includes: GlucaSafe, a
        functional health beverage with green and white tea,
        pomegranate extract and Cinnulin PF® which may support
        healthy glucose metabolism in many individuals;
        Vita-Tein, a protein based beverage available in
        chocolate super shake and a vanilla super shake; Power
        Blend, a noncarbonated juice energy drink; Chocolate
        Immunity Infusion Jr., and ChocKoala Immunity Jr.; a
        pair of hypoallergenic non-dairy, and non-soy
        protein-based products; and Ultra Greens, a juice
        beverage, which combines barley greens with the
        phytonutrients Spirulina and Chlorella.

        As American's lifestyles have evolved away from soda
        pop, and alternative beverages like bottled water and
        tea, coffee, and energy drinks have taken over the
        beverage industry, SWTS is well-positioned in the new
        and expanding market of vitamin and mineral enriched
        products.

        Sweet Success now offers a full line of healthy and
        functional beverages that are all-natural, great
        tasting, and are produced with state-of-the-art
        ingredients focused on delivering endurance, heart
        health, and a natural energy boost.  Operating within
        an Exploding Industry, the supplemental beverages that
        SWTS produces have been formulated and reformulated,
        test-marketed, and repositioned in their market space
        for consumers. The work is done and now SWTS is rolling
        out product across the U.S.  Sweet Success’ Fuel for
        Health™ beverages are coming to market at the right
        time; when the demand is high.

        Guarana - This potent rainforest herb with fiber-bound
        caffeine provides a gentler energy boost than coffee
        without the harsh side effects. Native Amazonians have
        used the seed extract for centuries to boost stamina.

        Ground Flax - One of the world's best sources of
        soluble fiber and valuable omega-3 fatty acid. It has
        been shown to improve heart health, lower cholesterol
        and help prevent arthritis.

        Aktivated Barley - A pre-sprouted grain that digests
        slowly for lasting endurance and lowered blood sugar
        levels. It is a great source of immune-boosting
        beta-glucan fiber.

        SAN ANTONIO, April 25, 2007 (PRIME NEWSWIRE) -- Sweet
        Success Enterprises (OTC BB:SWTS.OB - News), maker of a
        line of innovative and delicious healthy-lifestyle
        beverages, announced today the long-awaited
        availability of its Fuel for Health(tm) product line in
        H-E-B Grocery Company stores. Sweet Success offers a
        complete line of shelf stable, all natural functional
        beverages, including GlucaSafe(tm), the only beverage
        containing Cinnilun PF(r), that may support healthy
        glucose levels, as a key ingredient.

        Based in San Antonio, H-E-B employs more than 60,000
        Partners (employees) and serves millions of customers
        in more than 300 stores and 150 communities throughout
        Texas and Mexico.

        The complete line of the seven Fuel for Health
        beverages will be merchandised in Sweet Success coolers
        in select H-E-B Healthy Living stores plus placement on
        the shelf in other Healthy Living stores throughout the
        state. ``A part of our sales and distributions goals is
        to enter accounts we have targeted since we began beta
        testing our products through regional markets in
        2005,'' said William Gallagher, Sweet Success' Chairman
        and CEO. ``We are thrilled that we have attained cooler
        space in H-E-B's Healthy Living stores.''

        The coolers, which display all seven healthy beverages
        through a glass door, will be prominently placed in the
        high-end stores. While Sweet Success beverages are
        shelf stable, cooler placement will facilitate
        immediate consumption due to impulse buying. Each
        cooler will contain consumer information on functional
        ingredients, benefits and nutritional facts. Shortly
        after cooler placement, Sweet Success will conduct
        in-store demos to allow consumers to sample the all
        natural functional beverage line.

        Sweet Success healthy-lifestyle beverages will be
        delivered to the H-E-B stores by Kehe Food
        Distributors. The Company recently announced an
        agreement whereby the national distributor will carry
        all seven Fuel for Health products.

        San Antonio-based Sweet Success Enterprises, Inc.
        acquired Nestle's original Sweet Success(tm) brand in
        2002 and has re-launched a product line to tap into the
        rapidly growing demand for convenient and nutritious
        functional beverages. Its line of Fuel for Health(tm)
        all-natural beverages is available in a growing number
        of stores and includes select ingredients to satiate,
        boost energy and immunity and enhance a healthy
        lifestyle.

        These products are not intended to diagnose, treat,
        cure or prevent disease.

- heightened by media coverage.&nbsp; With so much published data on the
rising incidence of obesity and diabetes - especially among children -
as well as heart disease, cancer and a litany of other ailments affecting
our society, its no wonder that Americans are trending away from the long-standing
"soda pop" beverage industry leaders in favor of healthier alternatives
that may even address many of the aforementioned diseases.&nbsp;</font>
