the United States. Oregon borders the Pacific Ocean on the west, Washington on
the north, Idaho on the east, and California and Nevada on the south. The
Columbia and Snake Rivers form, respectively, much of its northern and eastern
borders. Between two north south mountain ranges in western Oregon mdash the
Pacific Coast Range and the Cascade Mountain Range mdash lies the Willamette
Valley, the most densely populated and agriculturally productive region of the
state.

Oregon has one of the most diverse landscapes of any state in the U.S. It is
well known for its tall, dense forests  its accessible, scenic Pacific
coastline  and its rugged, glaciated Cascade volcanoes. Other areas include
semiarid scrublands, prairies, and deserts that cover approximately half the
state in eastern and north central Oregon.

Oregon s population in 2000 was 3,421,399, a 20.4  increase over 1990. The
