The  giraffe   Giraffa camelopardalis  is an African even toed ungulate mammal,
the tallest of all land living animal species. Males can be 4.8 to 5.5 metres
 16 to 18 feet  tall and weigh up to 1,360 kilograms  3,000 pounds . The record 
sized bull was 5.87 m  19.2 feet  tall and weighed approximately 2,000 kg  4,400
lbs. .  ref [http   www.sandiegozoo.org animalbytes t giraffe.html San Diego Zoo
giraffe fact sheet] Retrieved 14 August 2006.  ref  Females are generally
slightly shorter and weigh less than the males do.

The giraffe is related to deer and cattle, but is placed in a separate family,
the Giraffidae, consisting only of the giraffe and its closest relative, the
okapi. Its range extends from Chad to South Africa.

Etymology and history The species name camelopardalis  camelopard  is derived
from its early Roman name, where it was described as having characteristics of
both a camel and a leopard
. ref http   www.eaudrey.com myth camelopard.htm  ref  The English word
camelopard first appeared in the 14th century and survived in common usage well
into the 19th century. A number of European languages retain it. The Arabic word
               ziraafa or zurapha, meaning  assemblage   of animals , or just
 tall , was used in English from the sixteenth century on, often in the
Italianate form giraffa.

Physical characteristics , Washington, DC.]] Male giraffes are around 16   18
feet tall at the horn tips, and weigh 1700   4200 lb. Females are one to two
feet shorter and weigh several hundred pounds less than males. Both sexes have
horns, although the horns of a female are smaller. The prominent horns are
formed from ossified cartilage and are called ossicones. The appearance of horns
is a reliable method of identifying the sex of giraffes, with the females
displaying tufts of hair on the top of the horns, whereas males  horns tend to
be bald on top   an effect of necking in combat. Males sometimes develop calcium
deposits which form bumps on their skull as they age, which can give the
appearance of up to three further horns. ref http   www.sandiegozoo.org animalbytes t 
giraffe.html  ref 

Giraffes have spots covering their entire bodies, except their underbellies,
with each giraffe having a unique pattern of spots. They have long, prehensile
tongues that are impervious to the thorns of the acacia trees that they feed
from and are distinctly blue black to protect from sunburn. Giraffes have long
necks, which they use to browse the leaves of trees. They possess seven
vertebrae in the neck  the usual number for a mammal . They also have slightly
elongated forelegs, about 10  longer than their hind legs.

Modifications to the giraffe s structure have evolved, particularly to the
circulatory system. A giraffe s heart, which can weigh up to 10 nbsp kg
 24 nbsp lb  and measure about 2 feet long, has to generate around double the
normal blood pressure for an average large mammal in order to maintain blood
flow to the brain against gravity. In the upper neck, a complex pressure 
regulation system called the rete mirabile prevents excess blood flow to the
brain when the giraffe lowers its head to drink. Conversely, the blood vessels
in the lower legs are under great pressure  because of the weight of fluid
pressing down on them . In other animals such pressure would force the blood out
through the capillary walls  giraffes, however, have a very tight sheath of
thick skin over their lower limbs which maintains high extravascular pressure in
exactly the same way as a pilot s g suit.

Some giraffes can lose the bottom part of their tail to cysts resulting from
tick bites.

Social structure, reproduction and sexuality painting of a giraffe brought by
Admiral Zheng He and placed in a Ming Dynasty zoo  AD 1414 ]] Female giraffes
associate in groups of a dozen or so members, occasionally including a few
younger males. Males tend to live in  bachelor  herds, with older males often
leading solitary lives. Reproduction is polygamous, with a few older males
impregnating all the fertile females in a herd. Male giraffes determine female
fertility by tasting the female s urine in order to detect estrus, in a multi 
step process known as the flehmen response.

Giraffe gestation lasts between 14 and 15 months, after which a single calf is
born. The mother gives birth standing up and the embryonic sack usually bursts
when the baby falls to the ground. Newborn giraffes are about 1.8 metres tall.
Within a few hours of being born, calves can run around and are
indistinguishable from a week old calf  however, for the first two weeks, they
spend most of their time lying down, guarded by the mother. While adult giraffes
are too large to be attacked by most predators, the young can fall prey to
lions, leopards, hyenas, and African Wild Dogs. It has been speculated that
their characteristic spotted pattern provides a certain degree of camouflage.
Only 25 to 50  of giraffe calves reach adulthood  the life expectancy is between
20 and 25 y</STYLE>
