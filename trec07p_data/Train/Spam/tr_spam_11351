Dear customer.This is the letter from the CanadianPharmacy. We prove that "generic" doesn't necessarily mean "expensive". If you shop for drugs online, please, read this to the end.Investigations show that the only ones to be protected from buying fake pills are those who shop at licensed Web pharmacies dealing straight with the manufacturer with no third parties involved (such as CanadianPharmacy). Try CanadianPharmacy our prices for real generic medications are the best.CanadianPharmacy 100% safety at the lowest price you've ever seen. Only generic drugs on sale.Best regards,Valeria Woodard
