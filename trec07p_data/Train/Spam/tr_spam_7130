The  Bald Eagle    Haliaeetus leucocephalus  , also known in North America as
the  American Eagle , is a bird of prey found in North America, most
recognizable as the national bird of the United States.

The species was on the brink of extinction in the US late in the 20th century,
but now has a stable population and is in the process of being removed from the
U.S. federal government s list of endangered species.

This sea eagle gets both its common and scientific names from the distinctive
appearance of the adult s head. Bald in the English name is derived from the
word [[piebald]], and refers to the white head and tail feathers and their
contrast with the darker body. The scientific name is derived from Haliaeetus,
New Latin for  sea eagle,   from the Ancient Greek haliaetos  and leucocephalus,
Latinized Ancient Greek for  white head , from leukos   white   and kephale
  head  .

Description and systematics

An immature Bald Eagle has speckled brown plumage, the distinctive white head
and body developing 2 3 years later, before sexual maturity. This species is
distinguishable from the Golden Eagle in that the latter has feathers which
extend down the legs. Also, the immature Bald Eagle has more light feathers in
the upper arm area, especially around the  armpit .

Adult females have an average wingspan of about 7 feet  2.1 meters   adult males
have a wingspan of 6 ft 6 in  2 meters . Adult females weigh approximately 12.8
lb  5.8 kg , males weigh 9 lb  4.1 kg . The smallest specimens are those from
Florida, where an adult male may barely exceed 5 lb  2.3 kg  and a wingspan of 6
feet  1.8 meters . The largest are the Alaskan birds, where large females may
exceed 15.5 lb  7 kg  and have a wingspan of approximately 8 feet  2.4 meters .

The northern birds are the subspecies washingtoniensis, whereas the southern
ones belong to the nominate subspecies leucocephalus. They are separated
approximately at latitude 38   N, or roughly the latitude of San Francisco 
northern birds reach a bit further south on the Atlantic Coast, where they occur
south to the Cape Hatteras area. Audubon s type specimen of   Washington s
Eagle     named in honor of George Washington ref  As explicitly stated by
Audubon. However, the subspecific name he chose   washingtoniensis   means
properly  from Washington  state  . There has been considerable confusion, with
some authors changing it to washingtoni,   George  Washington s , but the form
as originally written is correct.  ref 
  was apparently an exceptionally large bird, such as are more often found in
  Alaska  these have been proposed as subspecies alascanus or alascensis, but
  the variation is clinal and follows Bergmann s Rule.

The Bald Eagle forms a species pair with the Eurasian White tailed Eagle. These
diverged from other Sea Eagles at the beginning of the Early Miocene  c. 10 mya 
at latest, possibly   if the most ancient fossil record is correctly assigned to
this genus   as early as the Early Middle Oligocene, some 28 mya  Wink et al.
1996 ref  The authors  reservations about using the generalized  2   rate of
molecular evolution have since proven to be well founded.  ref  . As in other
sea eagle species pairs, this one consists of a white headed  the Bald Eagle 
and a tan headed species. They probably diverged in the North Pacific, spreading
westwards into Eurasia and eastwards into North America. Like the third northern
species, Steller s Sea eagle, they have yellow talons, beaks and eyes in adults.

Bald Eagles are powerful fliers, and also soar on thermal convection currents.

In the wild, Bald Eagles typically live about 20 30 years, but can realize a
life span of approximately 50 years. They generally live longer in captivity, up
to 60 years.

Bald Eagles normally squeak and have a shrill cry, punctuated by grunts. They do
not make the  eagle scream , usually the call of a Red tailed Hawk, that is
sometimes dubbed into films for dramatic effect.

Range, habitat, and restoration

The Bald Eagle s natural range covers most of North America, including most of
Canada, all of the continental United States, and northern Mexico. The bird
itself is able to live in most of North America s varied habitats from the
bayous of Louisiana to the Sonoran desert and the eastern deciduous forests o</STYLE>
