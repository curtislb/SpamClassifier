             SOLICITING FOR A REPRESENTATIVE IN YOUR COUNTRY
 
I am Mr.Graham Streeter, I  represent the above named Company based 
in Hong Kong. My company deals on raw materials for the production of 
textiles and fashion accessories for world trade. We are searching for 
representatives who can help us establish a medium of getting to our 
small scale customers in Europe and America as well as making payments 
through them to us.As the British regional manager of this upcoming company, I 
have been directed to relate with any interested individual or organisation 
because of the communication problem as well as payment problems.
 
We make delivery of our products  upfront,though  it's very risky but it 
should push up sales on 25 %. Thus we need to get payments for our products as 
soon as possible because customers can just "forget" to pay 
or never do.Your duty is to coordinate payments from customers and help us 
with the payment process. You are not involved in any sales. Our sales 
manager  sells products.Our customers will issue payments out in your name and 
you get them 
cashed or deposited in your bank when funds have cleared, deduct your 10% and 
forward the balance to the company. We understand it is an unusual and 
incredible job position, You'll have a lot of free time doing your regular job 
as this will not take any of your time.

MAIN REQUIREMENTS:
