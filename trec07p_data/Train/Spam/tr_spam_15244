        Dear StockUpTicks Reader:

        With the New York Mercantile Exchange, the world's largest
        physical commodity exchange, introducing on and off-exchange
        traded uranium futures products in May, it may be safe to say
        that uranium has indeed arrived.  This ascension for uranium,
        coupled with its vertical rise in spot price, certainly
        suggests that uranium has come of age.

        Meanwhile, uranium-centric companies like Uranium Energy Corp.
        (OTCBB:URME) are looking to monetize the interest and price of
        uranium with near term production.  The enthusiasm for the
        sector, validated in some part by the New York Mercantile’s
        recent move, gives small cap uranium companies unprecedented
        opportunity.

        Along these lines, CIBC World Markets Inc. raised its price
        forecasts for uranium oxide by 40%, citing an
        environmentally-driven renaissance in nuclear power and a gap
        between demand and supply for the metal.  The firm's chief
        economist, Jeffrey Rubin, said that he now expects the nuclear
        fuel, which is currently fetching $113 (U.S.) a pound, to hit
        $140 this year and $160 in 2008.  (See this report below)

        Nuclear energy to see rebirth in North America as concerns over
                               greenhouse gases
                   grow, finds new CIBC World Markets report

               Uranium prices to hit US$160 per pound by end of 2008

        TORONTO, April 17 /CNW/ - CIBC (CM: TSX; NYSE) - Concerns over
        greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired electricity plants
        will see a rebirth of nuclear energy in North America and
        continue to drive the price of uranium to record highs, finds a
        new report by CIBC World Markets.  CIBC World Markets' April
        Monthly Indicators report notes that environmental opposition
        has already forced TXU, the largest utility in Texas, to scrap
        some 6,000 megawatts of planned new coal-fired capacity in
        favour of building as many as five new nuclear facilities.
        Aside from refurbished plants in Ontario, they will be the
        first new nuclear stations started in North America in over 25
        years.

        "If you can't get coal-fired generating capacity licensed in
        Texas these days, where can you get coal plants built?" notes
        Jeff Rubin, Chief Economist and Chief Strategist at CIBC World
        Markets. "Coal-fired utilities find themselves the primary
        target of a tidal wave of greenhouse gas (GHG) legislation that
        is sweeping across state legislatures. Weaning American power
        consumers off cheap and abundant domestic coal supply is
        rapidly shaping up to be the frontline battleground of the
        carbon wars in North America."

        The report notes that nuclear power accounts for only 16 per
        cent of global power generation today but that it has a huge
        upside in a carbon-constrained world. Unlike other green power
        alternatives like wind and solar, nuclear facilities provide
        efficient and reliable base load power at an increasingly
        competitive price to coal once the costs of carbon emission are
        factored in.

        While only in the initial stages of rebirth in North America,
        nuclear power is already riding an expansionary wave from
        explosive power demand growth in Asia where 21 new reactors
        will come into service by the end of the decade and twice that
        many slated for operation by the end of the next decade.  With
        this rapid growth, Mr. Rubin states that finding enough uranium
        to power all those reactors is already becoming an issue.
        "Prices have more than doubled over the last six months and
        with utilities still needing to contract roughly a third of
        their uranium fuel requirements over the next five years, more
        and more are scrambling to lock in supplies." As a result, he
        predicts uranium oxide prices will hit US$140 per pound this
        year and US$160 per pound by late 2008 - more than triple the
        price of uranium last fall.

        The report also notes that uranium mines will only be able to
        supply little more than 60 per cent of global demand until at
        least the end of the decade, and possibly longer depending on
        when new production begins at the Cigar Lake mine in
        Saskatchewan and the Olympic Dam mine in Australia.

        Secondary supply sources, such as inventories held by
        utilities, mines, other fuel cycle companies and governments;
        reprocessed reactor fuels; diluted enriched materials from
        military programs; and the contents of depleted uranium
        stockpiles, will have to supply the balance. The report notes
        that secondary sources have played an important role in recent
        years, supplying as much as half of the fuel needs of U.S.
        reactors. However, these sources are ultimately finite and
        likely to decline, potentially quite rapidly, in coming years.

                                    [Image]
        Uranium Energy Corp., "URME" is a US-based junior resource
        company with the objective of becoming a near-term ISL uranium
        producer in the United States. URME is developing its
        advanced-stage Goliad Project in South Texas, with ISL uranium
        production projected to begin in 2009.

        URME controls one of the largest historical uranium exploration
        and development databases in the U.S. Through the use of these
        databases, URME has acquired advanced uranium properties
        throughout the southwestern U.S. including Texas, Wyoming, New
        Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and Utah.  This region has
        historically been the most concentrated area for uranium mining
        in the US. With the use of historical exploration databases,
        URME has been able to target properties for acquisition that
        have already been the subject of significant exploration and
        development by senior energy companies in the past.

        The operational management is comprised of pre-eminent uranium
        mining and exploration professionals, whose collective
        experience in the uranium mining industry gives URME the
        ongoing uranium mine-finding and uranium mine development
        expertise.

                            (TradeTech Uranium.info)

        To date, URME has successfully acquired property containing
        14.1 million pounds of historic uranium resources, with
        potential targets of 30.5 million pounds in additional
        resources being identified by the URME databases.

        URME's foundation project, located in Goliad County, Texas, has
        5.2 million pounds of historic, uranium resources with
        potential targets of 10 million pounds in additional
        resources.  Development drilling and ISL mine permitting are
        ongoing with a view to commencing ISL uranium production in
        2009.

                        America: The Next Uranium Giant

             The United States has 104 operating nuclear reactors
             generating more than 100 million megawatts of
             electricity each year, or approx. 20% of the
             country’s energy supply. These plants are using
             approximately 55 million pounds of U3O8 annually to
             produce this energy.  The U.S. is by far the largest
             user of uranium in the world.

                                 ABOUT URANIUM

                    Uranium is used primarily as an energy
                    source for nuclear fission reactors - a
                    safe, efficient, and emission-free
                    alternative to fossil fuels. The market
                    cycle for uranium had been largely
                    depressed since 1981, but has recently
                    experienced a sharp increase due to
                    macroeconomic factors.

                    An estimated supply shortfall of 80
                    million pounds per year, for several
                    coming years, is forecast by measuring
                    current annual reactor demand and
                    current annual mine production. In
                    addition, new nuclear power plants have
                    been commissioned throughout the world;
                    China, India and Russia alone have
                    permitted the construction of over 75
                    new reactors.

                    In the United States, uranium
                    exploration has become a national
                    initiative. In August 2005, President
                    Bush signed into law the Domenici-Barton
                    Energy Policy Act containing an array of
                    provisions that support nuclear power.
                    This enactment, combined with the
                    growing public recognition that nuclear
                    power plants generate electricity with
                    considerably less greenhouse emission
                    than fossil fuels, places URME in a
                    favorable position for funding and
                    exploring all aspects of uranium
                    development.

                          URME's Place in the Industry

             As in all mining of metals, there are stages of
             getting the ore out of the ground. Comparing all the
             'players' in the uranium mining business, some are
             huge companies in full production (generally mining
             for Gold and Silver as well). The more medium sized
             companies are generally operating, but usually for
             less than a year and are considered in a start-up
             phase of mining. Most of the smaller companies are
             PLANNING TO DEVELOP OR DEVELOPING their uranium
             mining operations and this is the category that URME
             falls into.

                 But there is a very significant difference...

             Peer competitors of URME include Uranerz Energy,
             UR-Energy, and Energy Metals. Not surprisingly, as
             with many SmallCap companies, the difference comes
             down to people and expertise.  URME has the most
             complete and experienced management and technical
             team when comes to building and operating ISL uranium
             mines in the U.S. and globally.  Add that to the fact
             that URME currently has the lowest market valuation
             compared to its immediate peers and its potential as
             a company and as a stock becomes quite clear.

                                  -------------

                           INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS

                * Public for less than a year, URME holds major
                  industry trump card: Management includes the ISL
                  experts who earlier built 80% of all current
                  U.S. uranium production facilities now in
                  operation!

                * URME is now drilling with four rigs to confirm
                  and expand current 5.2 mm lb historic uranium
                  resource at Goliad, a turn-key project in south
                  Texas. Scoping study for early production
                  commences in two months.

                * With 15 properties in six states, controlling
                  13.4 mm lbs. historic resource – and with
                  significant exploration databases from seven
                  earlier U3O8 explorers/producers – URME is
                  rapidly expanding its resources so production
                  can ramp up quickly.

                * The industry was last vital in the mid-70s to
                  early-80s – 20 to 30 years ago. This fact
                  directly highlights a major strategic advantage
                  held by Uranium Energy Corp. This company has
                  successfully brought on seven such
                  professionals, headed by two of the biggest
                  hitters in the North American uranium mining
                  industry: Harry Anthony and Spie Norris. In
                  terms of in-situ leaching, or ISL uranium
                  production, there is no stronger engineering
                  team.

                  and Vanadium Mines on the Colorado Plateau

            Acquisition Expands Company's Holdings Contiguous To US
                      Department of Energy Uranium Reserve

        AUSTIN, TEXAS--(MARKET WIRE)--Apr 10, 2007 -- Uranium Energy
        Corp (OTC BB:URME.OB - News)(Frankfurt:U6Z.F -
        News)(Berlin:U6Z.BE - News) announces that it has entered into
        an agreement to acquire approximately 5,000 acres in the Uravan
        Mineral Belt of the Colorado Plateau, in the states of Colorado
        and Utah. This acquisition compliments the Company's existing
        properties in this significant uranium- and vanadium-producing
        region.

        The Uravan Mineral Belt is the oldest uranium mining area in
        the United States. This geological trend arcs across the west
        central Colorado counties of Mesa, Montrose and San Miguel, and
        into northeastern Utah. Both uranium ores averaging 0.25% and
        vanadium ores averaging 1.7% are produced in the region from
        sandstone deposits, primarily in the Salt Wash Member of the
        Morrison Formation.

        This property was the subject of significant uranium
        exploration, and includes the sites of several past-producing
        uranium and vanadium mines. Some of the formerly-producing
        uranium mines within the property boundary include the Sandy,
        Babe Ruth, Bald Eagle, Fawn Springs #5, and Teapot Dome mines.
        The aggregate production from these mines was over 400,000
        pounds of uranium, and nearly 2.4 million pounds of vanadium.
        Grades of production in each case were close to the average for
        the mineral belt.

        The sites of the historical production are in close proximity
        to Uranium Energy Corp's existing properties, which are also
        the sites of historically-producing mines, and share mineral
        trends with those former mines. For example, the Babe Ruth Mine
        is 4 miles east of the Company's Raven Mine Project in
        Colorado. One area of the property is also contiguous to Cotter
        Corporation's large open pit and decline located on the US
        Department of Energy Uranium Reserve.

        A preliminary geological field assessment of all the properties
        was conducted last week by Company geologists, and was
        positive. The potential for development of uranium and vanadium
        resources has been indicated. Based on the assessment, certain
        areas have been given exploration priority. The Company is also
        pursuing the acquisition of additional uranium production and
        exploration data covering the property, with data for certain
        target areas being prioritized. It is anticipated that the
        historic uranium resource estimates will be available upon
        closing, which is expected to occur within 30 days. Drill
        permitting will be initiated immediately following the closing,
        with a view to carrying out delineation and step-out drilling.

                     Sandstone Uranium Mines in New Mexico

            New Acquisition to Yield Significant Historical Uranium
                Resources, and Prior Mining and Exploration Data

        AUSTIN, TEXAS--(MARKET WIRE)--Apr 3, 2007 -- Uranium Energy
        Corp (OTC BB:URME.OB - News)(Frankfurt:U6Z.F -
        News)(Berlin:U6Z.BE - News) has entered into an agreement with
        Spider Rock Mining, a private company, to acquire 8,500 acres
        under the administration of the U.S. Bureau of Land Management
        within the heart of the Ambrosia Lake Mining District, in the
        state of New Mexico. As part of the agreement, the Company will
        also acquire historic production information covering most of
        the property. The agreement is subject to a 30-day due
        diligence period.

        The acquisition is the site of over 8.5 million pounds of
        historical underground uranium production, primarily from the
        Ann Lee and Sandstone Mines, and is contiguous to the current
        uranium resource holdings of BHP Billiton. The Ambrosia Lake
        District includes some of the largest past-producing uranium
        mines in the U.S., operated at the time by Kerr McGee (now
        Andarko Petroleum), Homestake Mining (now Barrick Gold),
        Phillips Petroleum (now Conoco Phillips), and United Nuclear
        Corp. A substantial amount of production, development and
        exploration work has been completed on this property by these
        companies.

<p>Dear StockUpTicks Reader:
<p><font color="#000000">With the New York Mercantile Exchange, the world's
largest physical commodity exchange, introducing on and off-exchange traded
uranium futures products in May, it may be safe to say that uranium has
indeed arrived.&nbsp; This ascension for uranium, coupled with its vertical
rise in spot price, certainly suggests that uranium has come of age.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">Meanwhile, uranium-centric companies like <b>Uranium
Energy Corp. (OTCBB:URME)</b> are looking to monetize the interest and
price of uranium with near term production.&nbsp; The enthusiasm for the
sector, validated in some part by the New York Mercantile’s recent move,
gives small cap uranium companies unprecedented opportunity.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">Along these lines, <b>CIBC World Markets Inc.
</b>raised its price forecasts for uranium oxide by 40%, citing an environmentally-driven
renaissance in nuclear power and a gap between demand and supply for the
metal.&nbsp; <u>The firm's chief economist, Jeffrey Rubin, said that he
now expects the nuclear fuel, which is currently fetching $113 (U.S.) a
pound, to hit $140 this year and $160 in 2008</u>.&nbsp; <b>(<i>See this

North America as concerns over greenhouse gases&nbsp;</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Courier New,Courier">grow, finds new CIBC World Markets
report</font></b><font face="Courier New,Courier"></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Uranium prices
to hit US$160 per pound by end of 2008</i></font></center>
<font face="Courier New,Courier"></font>
<p><b><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>TORONTO, April 17
/CNW/ - CIBC (CM: TSX; NYSE)</font></font></b><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>
- Concerns over greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired electricity plants
will see a rebirth of nuclear energy in North America and continue to drive
the price of uranium to record highs, finds a new report by CIBC World
Markets.&nbsp; CIBC World Markets' April Monthly Indicators report notes
that environmental opposition has already forced TXU, the largest utility
in Texas, to scrap some 6,000 megawatts of planned new coal-fired capacity
in favour of building as many as five new nuclear facilities. Aside from
refurbished plants in Ontario, they will be the first new nuclear stations
started in North America in over 25 years.</font></font><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>"If you can't get coal-fired
generating capacity licensed in Texas these days, where can you get coal
plants built?" notes Jeff Rubin, Chief Economist and Chief Strategist at
CIBC World Markets. "Coal-fired utilities find themselves the primary target
of a tidal wave of greenhouse gas (GHG) legislation that is sweeping across
state legislatures. Weaning American power consumers off cheap and abundant
domestic coal supply is rapidly shaping up to be the frontline battleground
of the carbon wars in North America."</font></font><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>The report notes that
nuclear power accounts for only 16 per cent of global power generation
today but that it has a huge upside in a carbon-constrained world. Unlike
other green power alternatives like wind and solar, nuclear facilities
provide efficient and reliable base load power at an increasingly competitive
price to coal once the costs of carbon emission are factored in.</font></font><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>While only in the initial
stages of rebirth in North America, nuclear power is already riding an
expansionary wave from explosive power demand growth in Asia where 21 new
reactors will come into service by the end of the decade and twice that
many slated for operation by the end of the next decade.&nbsp; With this
rapid growth, Mr. Rubin states that finding enough uranium to power all
those reactors is already becoming an issue. "Prices have more than doubled
over the last six months and with utilities still needing to contract roughly
a third of their uranium fuel requirements over the next five years, more
and more are scrambling to lock in supplies." As a result, he predicts
uranium oxide prices will hit US$140 per pound this year and US$160 per
pound by late 2008 - more than triple the price of uranium last fall.</font></font><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>The report also notes
that uranium mines will only be able to supply little more than 60 per
cent of global demand until at least the end of the decade, and possibly
longer depending on when new production begins at the Cigar Lake mine in
Saskatchewan and the Olympic Dam mine in Australia.</font></font><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>Secondary supply sources,
such as inventories held by utilities, mines, other fuel cycle companies
and governments; reprocessed reactor fuels; diluted enriched materials
from military programs; and the contents of depleted uranium stockpiles,
will have to supply the balance. The report notes that secondary sources
have played an important role in recent years, supplying as much as half
of the fuel needs of U.S. reactors. However, these sources are ultimately
finite and likely to decline, potentially quite rapidly, in coming years.</font></font><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1></font></font>

<b><font color="#000000">Uranium Energy Corp., "URME"</font></b><font color="#000000">
is a US-based junior resource company with the objective of becoming a
near-term ISL uranium producer in the United States. URME is developing
its advanced-stage Goliad Project in South Texas, with ISL uranium production
projected to begin in 2009.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#000000">URME controls <u>one of the largest historical
uranium exploration and development databases</u> in the U.S. Through the
use of these databases, URME has acquired advanced uranium properties throughout
the southwestern U.S. including Texas, Wyoming, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado
and Utah.&nbsp; This region has historically been the most concentrated
area for uranium mining in the US. With the use of historical exploration
databases, URME has been able to target properties for acquisition that
have already been the subject of significant exploration and development
by senior energy companies in the past.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#000000">The operational management is comprised of pre-eminent
uranium mining and exploration professionals, whose collective experience
in the uranium mining industry gives URME the ongoing uranium mine-finding
and uranium mine development expertise.&nbsp;</font>

<blockquote>The United States has 104 operating nuclear reactors generating
more than 100 million megawatts of electricity each year, or approx. 20%

<center><b><font color="#004080"><font size=+1>ABOUT URANIUM</font></font></b></center>

<p><b><font color="#000000">Uranium is used primarily as an energy source
for nuclear fission reactors - a safe, efficient, and emission-free alternative
to fossil fuels. The market cycle for uranium had been largely depressed
since 1981, but has recently experienced a sharp increase due to macroeconomic
factors.&nbsp;</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">An estimated supply shortfall of 80 million
pounds per year, for several coming years, is forecast by measuring current
annual reactor demand and current annual mine production. In addition,
new nuclear power plants have been commissioned throughout the world; China,
India and Russia alone have permitted <u>the construction of over 75 new
reactors.&nbsp;</u></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">In the United States, </font><font color="#004080">uranium
exploration has become a national initiative</font><font color="#000000">.
In August 2005, President Bush signed into law the Domenici-Barton Energy
Policy Act containing an array of provisions that support nuclear power.
This enactment, combined with the growing public recognition that nuclear
power plants generate electricity <u>with considerably less greenhouse
emission than fossil fuels,</u> places URME in a favorable position for
funding and exploring all aspects of uranium development.</font></b></td>

<p><b><font color="#004080"><font size=+1>URME's Place in the Industry</font></font></b></center>

<blockquote>As in all mining of metals, there are stages of getting the
ore out of the ground. Comparing all the 'players' in the uranium mining
business, some are huge companies in full production (generally mining
for Gold and Silver as well). The more medium sized companies are generally
operating, but usually for less than a year and are considered in a start-up
phase of mining. Most of the smaller companies are <b><font color="#004080"><font size=-1>PLANNING
TO DEVELOP OR DEVELOPING </font></font></b><font color="#000000">their
uranium mining operations and this is the category that URME falls into.</font></blockquote>

<center><i><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>But there is a very significant
difference...</font></font></i></center>

<blockquote><font color="#000000">Peer competitors of URME include Uranerz
Energy, UR-Energy, and Energy Metals. Not surprisingly, as with many SmallCap
companies, the difference comes down to people and expertise.&nbsp; <b>URME
</b>has
the most complete and experienced management and technical team when comes
to building and operating ISL uranium mines in the U.S. and globally.&nbsp;
Add that to the fact that URME currently has the lowest market valuation
compared to its immediate peers and its potential as a company and as a
stock becomes quite clear.</font></blockquote>

<p><b><u><font size=+1>INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS</font></u></b></center>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<b><font size=+1>Public for less than a year, URME holds major industry
trump card: Management includes the ISL experts who earlier built <u>80%</u>
of all current U.S. uranium production facilities now in operation!</font></b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b><font size=+1>URME is now drilling with four rigs to confirm and expand
current 5.2 mm lb historic uranium resource at Goliad, a turn-key project
in south Texas. Scoping study for early production commences in two months.</font></b></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b><font size=+1>With 15 properties in six states, controlling 13.4 mm

WIRE)--Apr 10, 2007 -- Uranium Energy Corp (OTC BB:URME.OB - News)(Frankfurt:U6Z.F
- News)(Berlin:U6Z.BE - News)</font></font></b><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>
announces that it has entered into an agreement to acquire approximately
5,000 acres in the Uravan Mineral Belt of the Colorado Plateau, in the
states of Colorado and Utah. This acquisition compliments the Company's
existing properties in this significant uranium- and vanadium-producing
region.</font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>The Uravan Mineral Belt
is the oldest uranium mining area in the United States. This geological
trend arcs across the west central Colorado counties of Mesa, Montrose
and San Miguel, and into northeastern Utah. Both uranium ores averaging
0.25% and vanadium ores averaging 1.7% are produced in the region from
sandstone deposits, primarily in the Salt Wash Member of the Morrison Formation.</font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>This property was the
subject of significant uranium exploration, and includes the sites of several
past-producing uranium and vanadium mines. Some of the formerly-producing
uranium mines within the property boundary include the Sandy, Babe Ruth,
Bald Eagle, Fawn Springs #5, and Teapot Dome mines. The aggregate production
from these mines was over 400,000 pounds of uranium, and nearly 2.4 million
pounds of vanadium. Grades of production in each case were close to the
average for the mineral belt.</font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>The sites of the historical
production are in close proximity to Uranium Energy Corp's existing properties,
which are also the sites of historically-producing mines, and share mineral
trends with those former mines. For example, the Babe Ruth Mine is 4 miles
east of the Company's Raven Mine Project in Colorado. One area of the property
is also contiguous to Cotter Corporation's large open pit and decline located
on the US Department of Energy Uranium Reserve.</font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font size=-1>A preliminary geological
field assessment of all the properties was conducted last week by Company
geologists, and was positive. The potential for development of uranium
and vanadium resources has been indicated. Based on the assessment, certain
areas have been given exploration priority. The Company is also pursuing
the acquisition of additional uranium production and exploration data covering
the property, with data for certain target areas being prioritized. It
is anticipated that the historic uranium resource estimates will be available
upon closing, which is expected to occur within 30 days. Drill permitting
will be initiated immediately following the closing, with a view to carrying
out delineation and step-out drilling.</font></font>
