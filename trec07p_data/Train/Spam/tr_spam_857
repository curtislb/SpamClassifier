  .]]  Fortifications  are military constructions and buildings designed for
defense in warfare. Humans have constructed defensive works for many thousands
of years, in a variety of increasingly complex designs. The term is derived from
the Latin fortis   strong   and facere   to make  .

Many military installations are known as  forts , although they are not always
fortified. Larger forts may class as  fortresses , smaller ones formerly often
bore the name of  fortalices . The word  fortification  can also refer to the
practice of improving an area s defense with defensive works. City walls are
 fortifications  but not necessarily called  fortresses .

The art of laying out a military camp or constructing a fortification
traditionally classes as  castrametation , since the time of the Roman legions.
The art science of laying siege to a fortification and of destroying it has the
popular name of siegecraft and the formal name of poliorcetics. In some texts
this latter term also applies to the art of building a fortification.

Fortification is usually divided into two branches, namely  permanent
fortification  and  field fortification . Permanent fortifications are erected
at leisure, with all the resources that a state can supply of constructive and
mechanical skill, and are built of enduring materials. Field fortifications are
extemporized by troops in the field, perhaps assisted by such local labor and
tools as may be procurable and with materials that do not require much
preparation, such as earth, brushwood and light timber. There is also an
intermediate branch known as  semipermanent fortification . This is employed
when in the course of a campaign it becomes desirable to protect some locality
with the best imitation of permanent defences that can be made in a short time,
ample resources and skilled civilian labor being available.

Medieval style fortifications were largely made obsolete by the arrival of
cannons on the 14th century battlefield. Fortifications in the age of
blackpowder evolved into much lower structures with greater use of ditches and
earth ramparts that would absorb and disperse the energy of cannon fire. Walls
exposed to direct cannon fire were very vulnerable, so were sunk into ditches
fronted by earth slopes. star fort, restored to 1750 situation, Groningen
 province , Netherlands]] This placed a heavy emphasis on the geometry of the
fortification to allow defensive cannonry interlocking fields of fire to cover
all approaches to the lower and thus more vulnerable walls. Fortifications also
extended in depth, with protected batteries for defensive cannonry, to allow
them to engage attacking cannon to keep them at a distance and prevent them
bearing directly on the vulnerable walls. The result was star shaped
fortifications with tier upon tier of hornworks and bastions, of which Bourtange
illustrated to the left is an excellent example. There are also extensive
fortifications from this era in the Nordic states and in Britain, the
fortifications of Berwick on Tweed being a fine example.

The arrival of explosive shells in the nineteenth century led to yet another
stage in the evolution of fortification. Star forts of the cannon era did not
fare well against the effects of high explosive and the intricate arrangements
of bastions, flanking batteries and the carefully constructed lines of fire for
the defending cannon could be rapidly disrupted by explosive shells. Worse, the
large open ditches surrounding forts of this type were an integral part of the
defensive scheme, as was the covered way at the edge of the counter scarp. The
ditch was extremely vulnerable to bombardment with explosive shells.

In response, military engineers evolved the polygonal style of fortification.
The ditch became deep and vertically sided, cut directly into the native rock or
soil, laid out as a series of straight lines creating the central fortified area
that gives this style of fortification its name.

Wide enough to be an impassable barrier for attacking troops, but narrow enough
to be a difficult target for enemy shellfire, the ditch wa</STYLE>
