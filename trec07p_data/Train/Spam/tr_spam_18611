        Dear Reader,

        Please take a look at these two brief company
        descriptions:

        Focus Media Holding Limited (Nasdaq: FMCN) operates an
        out-of-home advertising network using audiovisual
        television displays in China. Its out-of-home
        advertising network consists of commercial location
        network, in-store network, poster frame network, mobile
        handset advertising network, and outdoor LED network.
        The commercial location network includes flat-panel
        television displays placed in high-traffic areas of
        commercial buildings, such as in lobbies and near
        elevators, as well as in beauty parlors, karaoke
        parlors, golf country clubs, auto shops, banks,
        pharmacies, hotels, airports, airport shuttle buses,
        and in-air flights.

        And…

        i-level media group (OTCBB: ILVL) is an emerging media
        company delivering powerful digital media solutions for
        out-of-home advertising (“OA”) in the People’s Republic
        of China (“PRC”). The company is focused on an
        underdeveloped market niche with enormous potential:
        Digital media advertising in taxis.

        At StockUpTicks we love growth industries. That’s how
        we see this mobile advertising niche that both the
        aforementioned companies are endeavoring within. But
        the only thing better than a growth industry is a
        growth industry in a growth market. And that’s how we
        see China.

        Of course, it doesn’t hurt that the first company
        detailed above, Focus Media, has risen from less than
        $10 to nearly $40 over the last couple years either
        (See chart) HERE

        So, when we were presented with the opportunity to
        introduce i-level media to our StockUpTicks.com and
        SmallCap Sentinel readership we jumped at the chance.
        Take a stroll through the company profile below and
        perhaps you’ll see why.

        China's advertising market is taking off as Chinese and
        foreign companies seek access to the increasing
        spending power of China's consumers and enterprises.
        China's overall spending on advertising exceeded US$15
        billion in 2004 and US$17.7 billion in 2005, according
        to China's State Administration for Industry and
        Commerce (SAIC).

        Smith Barney estimates that China’s outdoor ad market
        will expand at a cumulative annual growth rate (CAGR)
        of 16% over the next two years, outpacing
        the growth of the general ad market and TV and print
        advertising in particular. In 2006, OA spending in
        China topped US $2.25 billion. A recent China Marketing
        and Media Study (CMMS) survey conducted in 20 cities
        indicates OA ranks second only to television as the
        most influential medium.

        China now has 1.3 billion people, but only 20 million
        cars. Of these, 870,000 are taxis. The primary taxi
        users are affluent, upwardly mobile professionals
        with high disposable incomes – and high rates of
        consumption for high end products and services, many of
        them global brands.

                       • China’s advertising
                       industry is on track to
                       become the third largest
                       in the world by 2011,
                       behind only the US and
                       Japan

                       • The Company has begun
                       operations in
                       Shanghai—the largest
                       advertising market in
                       China, attracting 23% of
                       total OA spending

                       • i-level will penetrate
                       secondary media markets
                       in China, and
                       internationally, through
                       licensing and franchising
                       programs

                By developing a proprietary digital media
                   platform and securing an exclusive
                  distribution agreement with a leading
                 Shanghai taxi operator, the company has
               already launched an effective and scalable
                   advertising platform with excellent
                     revenue-generating potential.

                             But why taxis?

        Taxis are ideal for the delivery of digital media
        because they provide prolonged and intimate access to a
        captive audience of a highly-desirable demographic.
        Taxi users in China are primarily members of the
        affluent class of upwardly mobile professionals, having
        higher than average disposable incomes and a desire for
        higher-end products and services.

        i-level's media platform consists of thousands of
        flat-panel LCD screens installed in the passenger
        compartments of taxis in major urban centers.  By
        securing additional long-term media concessions with
        taxi operators, i-level is building a valuable
        proprietary media network on which it can sell
        advertising time slots to local and multinational
        advertisers.

           The affluent and the upper middle class get around
                            Shanghai in taxis

        These individuals are eager to become integrated in the
        global economy and to enjoy the living standards of
        developed nations. This in turn has been a catalyst for
        rapid growth in the demand for fast-moving consumer
        goods and higher-end products and services.
        Consequently, producers of such goods and services are
        clamoring for effective media to reach this emerging
        middle class and tap into its fast-growing buying
        power. i-level meets this need by providing an
        innovative and exciting medium that effectively targets
        these individuals.

        i-level is well positioned for rapid expansion with
        870,000 taxis in major cities across China – and
        accessing a direct channel to China’s most affluent,
        mobile audience with higher than average disposable
        incomes. Management at i-level projects 25-fold revenue

        Market Setting
        In-store TV advertising has been around for years. Many
        retailers in the US run instore advertising networks in
        order to drive shoppers into impulse purchases. Many
        retailers in China, such as Walmart, also operate their
        own networks. In-store flat screen advertising run by
        third-party operators began in China in 2003.

        Market Setting
        China’s mobile TV advertising market comprises several
        segments: bus TV advertising, taxi TV advertising,
        metro TV advertising, train TV advertising and TV
        advertising services on other vehicles. Mobile TV
        service first appeared in Shanghai in 2003.

        Market Setting
        Despite the lower-income demographics of passengers on
        public buses and subways when compared to taxi
        passengers, the sheer numbers of potential viewers (and
        the mindless boredom of taking a bus) makes the market
        attractive. One of the main selling points of bus and
        subway advertising is the large audiences that
        typically view the operators' screens.

        The top four markets of Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou
        and Shenzhen and account for more than 50 percent of
        the ad dollars spent in China. The ultimate goal for
        i-level  is a nationwide network. Of the nine minutes
        currently in use, the mix is approximately 50/50 ads to
        content, including: food, fashion, and real estate
        travel.

         "We run a nine minute cycle on our screens because the
         average taxi ride in Shanghai is 18 minutes, according
           to Sino monitor. So an average a passenger has the
          opportunity to see any given ad twice. We also offer
         content. Channel V provides content and we are looking
               at working with other content providers."

<p>Dear Reader,
<p><i>Please take a look at these two brief company descriptions:</i>
<p><b>Focus Media Holding Limited (Nasdaq: FMCN) </b>operates an out-of-home
advertising network using audiovisual television displays in China. Its
out-of-home advertising network consists of commercial location network,
in-store network, poster frame network, mobile handset advertising network,
and outdoor LED network.&nbsp; The commercial location network includes
flat-panel television displays placed in high-traffic areas of commercial
buildings, such as in lobbies and near elevators, as well as in beauty
parlors, karaoke parlors, golf country clubs, auto shops, banks, pharmacies,
hotels, airports, airport shuttle buses, and in-air flights.
<p><b>And…</b>
<p><b>i-level media group (OTCBB: ILVL)</b> is an emerging media company
delivering powerful digital media solutions for out-of-home advertising
(“OA”) in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”). The company is focused
on an underdeveloped market niche with enormous potential: Digital media
advertising in taxis.
<p>At <b><font color="#000099">StockUpTicks</font></b> we love growth industries.
That’s how we see this mobile advertising niche that both the aforementioned
companies are endeavoring within. But the only thing better than a growth
industry is a growth industry in a growth market. And that’s how we see
China.
<p><u>Of course, it doesn’t hurt that the first company detailed above,
Focus Media, has risen from less than $10 to nearly $40 over the last couple
years either</u> (See chart) <a href="http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/quickchart/quickchart.asp?symb=fmcn&sid=0&o_symb=fmcn&freq=1&time=9">HERE</a>
<p>So, when we were presented with the opportunity to introduce i-level
media to our StockUpTicks.com and SmallCap Sentinel readership we jumped
at the chance. Take a stroll through the company profile below and perhaps
you’ll see why.

<p>China's advertising market is taking off as Chinese and foreign companies
seek access to the increasing spending power of China's consumers and enterprises.
China's overall spending on advertising <u>exceeded</u> US$15 billion in
2004 and US$17.7 billion in 2005, according to China's State Administration
for Industry and Commerce (SAIC).
<p>Smith Barney estimates that China’s outdoor ad market will expand at
a cumulative annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16% over the next two years,
outpacing
<br>the growth of the general ad market and TV and print advertising in
particular. In 2006, OA spending in China topped US $2.25 billion. A recent
China Marketing and Media Study (CMMS) survey conducted in 20 cities indicates
OA ranks second only to television as the most influential medium.
<p>China now has 1.3 billion people, but only 20 million cars. Of these,
<b>870,000</b>
are taxis. The primary taxi users are affluent, upwardly mobile professionals
<br>with high disposable incomes – and high rates of consumption for high
end products and services, many of them global brands.

class of upwardly mobile professionals, having higher than average disposable
incomes and a desire for higher-end products and services.&nbsp;
<p>i-level's media platform consists of thousands of flat-panel LCD screens
installed in the passenger compartments of taxis in major urban centers.&nbsp;
By securing additional long-term media concessions with taxi operators,
<u>i-level
is building a valuable proprietary media network</u> on which it can sell
advertising time slots to local and multinational advertisers.

<p>These individuals are eager to become integrated in the global economy
and to enjoy the living standards of developed nations. This in turn has
been a catalyst for rapid growth in the demand for fast-moving consumer
goods and higher-end products and services. Consequently, producers of
such goods and services are clamoring for effective media to reach this
emerging middle class and tap into its fast-growing buying power. i-level
meets this need by providing an innovative and exciting medium that effectively

<p><font color="#000066"><font size=+2>Market Setting</font></font>
<br>In-store TV advertising has been around for years. Many retailers in
the US run instore advertising networks in order to drive shoppers into
impulse purchases. Many retailers in China, such as Walmart, also operate
their own networks. In-store flat screen advertising run by third-party
operators began in China in 2003.
<p><font color="#000066"><font size=+2>Market Setting</font></font>
<br>China’s mobile TV advertising market comprises several segments: bus
TV advertising, taxi TV advertising, metro TV advertising, train TV advertising
and TV advertising services on other vehicles. Mobile TV service first
appeared in Shanghai in 2003.
<p><font color="#000066"><font size=+2>Market Setting</font></font>
<br>Despite the lower-income demographics of passengers on public buses
and subways when compared to taxi passengers, the sheer numbers of potential
viewers (and the mindless boredom of taking a bus) makes the market attractive.
One of the main selling points of bus and subway advertising is the large
audiences that typically view the operators' screens.
<p>The top four markets of Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen and
account for more than 50 percent of the ad dollars spent in China. The
ultimate goal for i-level&nbsp; is a nationwide network. Of the nine minutes
currently in use, the mix is approximately 50/50 ads to content, including:
food, fashion, and real estate travel.
