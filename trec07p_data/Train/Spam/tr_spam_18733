<=21--A few hours before Sonia Gandhi took the manch and addressed a crowd of about 20,000 i=
n Rae Bareli, she had a rather painful opening act.

Walking into the maidan, you hear a child yelling jingoistically into the microphone. Thi=
s is Sadhana Bharati, 11, the kind of over-precocious child that makes you wish someone gen=
erously smeared strawberry flavoured lip balm onto duct tape.

Sadhana, hyped by the Congress as their pint-sized answer to Uma -- why any party should see=
k such a thing is itself beyond comprehension; the idea of an Uma Bharti mini-me is absolute=
ly nightmarish -- has apparently been speaking in public since before she was 3. Now she's a=
 seasoned political campaigner, talking about herself in the third person as she shouts ou=
t BJP-deriding slogans.

Sadhana talks like a sycophantic vet, all fire and brimstone as she constantly invokes her=
self into her speech. She calls herself a daughter to everyone from Rahul Gandhi to Prime Mi=
nister Manmohan Singh, and asks for the public's applause. Initially amused, the crowds i=
ndulge her -- till the Congress announcer cuts her short and tersely asks her, again, to win=
d up.
