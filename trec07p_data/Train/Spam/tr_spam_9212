 of Canada scissors over the bar at the 1928 Summer Olympics. Her winning result
 was 1.59 m]]

 For the US Military operation, see [[Operation Highjump]].

The  high jump  is an athletics  track and field  event in which competitors
must jump over a horizontal bar placed at measured heights without aid of any
devices. It has been contested since the Olympic Games of ancient Greece. Over
the centuries since, competitors have introduced increasingly more effective
techniques to arrive at the current form. Javier Sotomayor is both the indoor
and outdoor world record holder in this event with jumps of 2.43m  8 feet  and
2.45m  8 feet    inch , respectively.

In as early as the ancient Greek Olympics, the first recorded high jump event
took place in Scotland in the 19th century, with heights of up to  1.68 m 
measured. Early but old jumpers used either an elaborate straight on approach or
a scissors technique. In the latter, the bar was approached using a diagonal
technique, and the jumper threw first the inside leg and then the other over the
bar in a scissoring motion. Around the turn of the century, techniques began to
modernise, starting with M.F. Sweeney s [[Eastern cut off]]. By taking off as in
the scissors, but extending his back and flattening out over the bar, the Irish 
American gained a more economic clearance and took the world record to 6 5 5 8 
 1.97 m  in 1895.

Another American, M.F. Horine, developed a yet more efficient technique, the
 Western roll . In this style, the bar again is approached on a diagonal, but
the inner leg is used for the take off, while the outer leg is thrust up to lead
the body sideways over the bar. Horine took the world standard to 6 7   2.01 m 
in 1912. His technique predominated through the Berlin Olympics of 1936 where
the event was won by Cornelius Johnson at 2.03 m  6 9 3 4  .

American and Russian jumpers held the playing field for the next four decades,
and they saw the evolution of the straddle technique. Straddle jumpers took off
as in the Western roll, but rotated their  belly down  torso around the bar,
obtaining the most economical clearance to date. Straddle jumper Charles Dumas
broke the elusive 7   2.13 m  barrier in 1956, and American wunderkind John
Thomas pushed the world mark to 2.23 m  7 3 3 4   in 1960. Valeriy Brumel took
over the event for the next four years. The elegant Soviet jumper radically sped
up his approach run, took the record up to 2.28 m  7 5 3 4  , and won the
Olympic gold medal in 1964, before a motorcycle accident foreshortened his
career.

American coaches, including two time NCAA champion Frank Costello of the
University of Maryland, flocked to Russia to learn from Brumel and his coaches.
However it would be a solitary innovator at Oregon State University, Dick
Fosbury, who would bring the high jump into the next century. Taking advantage
of the raised, softer landing areas by then in use, Fosbury added a new twist to
the outmoded Eastern Cut off. He directed himself over the bar head and
shoulders first sliding over on his back and landing in a fashion which would
likely have broken his neck in the old sawdust landing pits. After he used this
Fosbury flop to win the 1968 Olympic gold medal, the technique began to spread
around the world, and soon floppers were dominating international high jump
competitions. The last straddler to set a world record was the late Vladimir
Yashchenko, who cleared 2.33 m  7 7 3 4   in 1977 and then 2.35 m  7 8 1 2  
indoors in 1978.
