Odocoileinae br  Cervinae br  Hydropotinae br  Muntiacinae br     A  deer  is a
ruminant mammal belonging to the family  [[Cervidae]] . A number of broadly
similar animals, from related families within the order Artiodactyla, are often
also called deer. Names Depending on their species, male deer are called stags,
harts, bucks or bulls, and females are called hinds, does or cows. Young deer
are called fawns or calfs. Hart is an expression for a stag, particularly a Red
Deer stag past its fifth year. It is not commonly used, but an example is in
Shakespeare s [[Romeo and Juliet]] when Tybalt refers to the brawling Montagues
and Capulets as hartless hinds.  The White Hart  and  The Red Hart  are common
English pub names.

The adjective of relation pertaining to deer is [[Wiktionary cervine/cervine]].

Habitat Deer are widely distributed, and hunted, with indigenous representatives
in all continents except Antarctica and Australia. There are European Red Deer
in the Atlas Mountains of Algeria and Tunisia in Northern Africa. Deer live in a
variety of biomes ranging from tundra to the tropical rainforest. While often
associated with forests, many deer are ecotone species that live in transitional
areas between forests and thickets  for cover  and prairie and savanna  open
space . The majority of large deer species inhabit temperate mixed deciduous
forest, mountain mixed coniferous forest, tropical seasonal dry forest, and
savanna habitats around the world. Clearing open areas within forests to some
extent may actually benefit deer populations by exposing the understory and
allowing the types of grasses, weeds, and herbs to grow that deer like to eat.
However, adequate forest or brush cover must still be provided for populations
to grow and thrive. Small species such as the brocket deer and pudus of Central
and South America, and the muntjacs of Asia do occupy dense forests and are less
often seen in open spaces. There are also several species of deer that are
highly specialized and live almost exclusively in mountains, grasslands, swamps
and  wet  savannas, riparian corridors surrounded by deserts. Some deer have a
circumpolar distribution in both North America and Eurasia. Examples include the
reindeer and caribou that live in Arctic tundra and taiga  boreal forests  and
moose that inhabit taiga and adjacent areas.

The highest concentration of large deer species in temperate North America lies
in the Canadian Rocky Mountain and Columbia Mountain Regions between Alberta and
British Columbia where all five North American deer species  White tailed Deer,
Mule deer, Caribou, Elk, and Moose  can be found. This is a region that boasts
mountain slopes with moist coniferous forests and alpine meadows, and lowlands
with a mosaic of cropland and deciduous parklands within vicinity of lakes and
rivers. The Caribou live at higher altitudes in the subalpine meadows and alpine
tundra areas. The White tailed Deer have recently expanded their range within
the foothills of the Canadian Rockies due to conversion of land to cropland and
the clearing of coniferous forests allowing more deciduous vegetation to grow.

The highest concentration of large deer species in temperate Asia occurs in the
mixed deciduous forests, mountain coniferous forests, and taiga bordering North
Korea, Manchuria  Northeastern China , and the Ussuri Region  Russia . These are
among some of the richest deciduous and coniferous forests in the world where
one can find Siberian Roe Deer, Sika Deer, Caribou, Elk, and Moose. Just south
of this region in China, one can find the unusual Pere David s Deer. Deer such
as the Sika Deer, Thorold s Deer, Central Asian Red Deer, and Elk have
historically been farmed for their antlers by Han Chinese, Turkic peoples,
Tungusic peoples, Mongolians, and Koreans. Like the Lapps of Finland and
Scandinavia, the Tungusic peoples, Mongolians, and Turkic peoples of Southern
Siberia, Northern Mongolia, and the Ussuri Region have also taken to raising semi 
domesticated herds of caribou.
