The city of  Worcester   pronounced   is a city and the county town of
Worcestershire in England, situated some 30 miles  48 km  southwest of
Birmingham and 29 miles  47 km  north of Gloucester. The River Severn runs
through the middle, with the city s large cathedral overlooking the river.

History Occupation of the site of Worcester can be dated back to neolithic
times, a village surrounded by defensive ramparts having been founded on the
eastern bank of the River Severn here in around 400 BC. The position, which
commanded a ford on the river, was in the 1st century used by the Romans to
establish what may at first have been a fort on the military route from Glevum
 Gloucester  to Viroconium  Wroxeter  but which soon developed  mdash  as the
frontier of the empire was pushed westwards  mdash  into an industrial town with
its own pottery kilns and iron smelting plants.

Roman Worcester  which may have been the Vertis mentioned in the 7th century
Ravenna Cosmography  was a thriving trading and manufacturing centre for some
three hundred years, though by the time of the Roman withdrawal from Britain in
407 it had dwindled considerably in size and is not recorded again until the mid 
7th century when documents mention the Anglo Saxon settlement of
[http   ang.wikipedia.org wiki Wiogoraceastre Weogornaceaster]. The fact that
Worcester was chosen at this time  ndash  in preference to both the much larger
Gloucester and the royal centre of Winchcombe  ndash  to be the Episcopal See of
a new diocese covering the area suggests that there was a well established, and
powerful, English Christian community living on the site when it fell into
English hands.

The town was almost destroyed in 1041 after a rebellion against the punitive
taxation of Harthacanute. The town was attacked several times in the civil war
 in 1139, 1150 and 1151  between King Stephen and Empress Matilda, daughter of
Henry I.

By late medieval times the population had grown to around 10,000 as the
manufacture of cloth started to become a large local industry. The town was
designated a county corporate, giving it autonomy from local government.



Worcester was the site of the Battle of Worcester  September 3, 1651 , when
Charles II s attempt to regain the crown by force was decisively defeated, in
the fields a little to the west and south of the city, near the village of
Powick. After being defeated, Charles returned to his headquarters in what is
now known as King Charles house in the Cornmarket, before fleeing in disguise to
Boscobel House in Shropshire and his eventual escape to France. Worcester was
one of the cities loyal to the King in that war, for which it was given the
epithet  The Faithful City .

The Royal Worcester Porcelain Company factory was founded by Dr John Wall in
1750, although it no longer produces goods. A handful of decorators are still
employed at the factory and the Museum is still open.

During the 18th century Worcester s trade languished compared to more modern
towns of the West Midlands. The Worcester and Birmingham Canal opened in 1815
allowing Worcester goods to be transported to a larger conurbation.

The British Medical Association  BMA  is reputed to have been founded in the
Board Room of the old Worcester Royal Infirmary building in Castle Street around
1860. This building has now been closed and  as of 2006  will be redeveloped as
the University of Worcester city campus.

In the 1950s and 1960s large areas of the medieval centre of Worcester were
demolished and rebuilt as a result of decisions by town planners. There is still
a significant area of medieval Worcester remaining, but it is a small fraction
of what was present before the redevelopments.

The current city boundaries date from 1974, when the Local Government Act 1972
transferred the parishes of Warndon and St. Peter the Great County into the
city.

Politics The city council is currently controlled by the Conservative Party, who
hold 18 of the council s 35 seats.

Worcester has one member of Parliament, Michael Foster of the Labour Party, who
represents the Worcester constituency.

Industry and commerce Industry is now quite varied. In the 19th and early
twentieth century, Worcester was a major centre for glove manufacture, but this
has declined greatly. The late Victorian period saw the growth of ironfounders,
like Heenan   Froude, Hardy   Padmore and McKenzie   Holland and the inter war
years saw the </STYLE>
