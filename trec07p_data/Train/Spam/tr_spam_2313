        End Infobox Dogbreed info. Article Begins Here     The  Keeshond   IPA
pronunciation  or KAYZ hond  plural   Keeshonden   is a medium sized dog with a
plush two layer coat of silver and black fur with a  ruff  and a curled tail,
originating in the Netherlands. Its closest relative is the Pomeranian.
Originally called the  [[German Spitz]] , more specifically the  Wolfspitz , the
name was officially changed to Keeshond in 1925.

Appearance

A member of the spitz group of dogs, the Kees is 17 to 18 inches  about 45 cm 
tall and weighs 35 to 40 pounds  about 16 to 18 kg . Sturdily built, they have a
typical spitz appearance, neither coarse nor refined. They have a wedge shaped
head, a medium length muzzle with a definite stop, small pointed ears and an
expressive face. The tail is tightly curled and, in profile, should be carried
such that it is indistinguishable from the compact body of the dog.

Coat Like all spitzes, the Kees has a profuse double coat, with a thick ruff
around the neck. Typically, the males of this breed will have a thicker, more
pronounced ruff than the females. The tail is well plumed, and feathering on the
fore and hind legs adds to the soft look of the breed. The coat is shown
naturally, and should not be wavy, silky, or long enough to form a natural part
down the back.

Color The Keeshond is a color specific spitz type  many of the names of the dog
refer to the distinctive wolf color of the breed. The color is a mix of grey,
black and cream. The top coat is tipped with black, while the undercoat is pale
grey, white, or cream  never tawny . The color can range from very pale to very
dark, but the Kees should neither be black nor white, and the ruff and
 trousers  of the hind legs should be a distinctly lighter grey, white, or
cream.

The plumed tail should be of a white or cream color with a black tip on the very
end. The ears and muzzle are to be black, although some Kees tend to develop
 milk mouth  or a white shading around the nose and front of the muzzle. In
American shows, this white shading is acceptable, although not desired.

It is also important to note that the feet are to also be of the same cream, or
lighter grey color as the legs. Feet that are totally black, or white are not
desirable. However, light penciling is accepted.

The other important marking is the  spectacles,  a delicate dark line running
from the outer corner of each eye toward the lower corner of each ear, which,
coupled with markings forming short eyebrows, is necessary for the distinct
expressive look of the breed. All markings should be clear, not muddled or
broken.

Temperament

Keeshonden tend to be very playful, with quick reflexes and strong jumping
ability. Keeshonden can be stubborn, but they are quick learners and eager to
please. Because Keeshonden are quick learners, they also learn the things you
didn t necessarily wish to teach them   very quickly. However, Keeshonden make
excellent agility and obedience dogs. So amenable to proper training is this
bright, sturdy dog that Keeshonden have been successfully trained to serve as
guide dogs for the blind  only their lack of size has prevented them from being
more widely used in this role.

They love children and are excellent family dogs, preferring to be close to
their humans whenever possible. They generally get</STYLE>
