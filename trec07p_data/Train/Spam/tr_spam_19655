<center><=21--When Americans are imperiled, ultimately the president has to bear that r=
esponsibility,=22 Clinton said at the time of the Somalia vote.

Now, McCain =E2=80=94 a GOP presidential contender for 2008 =E2=80=94 says setting a date=
 certain on the war in Iraq is like sending a =22memo to our enemies to let them know when they c=
an operate again.=22

Matt David, McCain's campaign spokesman, said it is =22intellectually dishonest=
=22 to compare Iraq to Haiti and Somalia because of the volatility now in the Middle East and=
 terrorist threat.

=22Haitians and Somalians do not want to follow us home and attack us on American soil,=
=22 David said in a statement.

William Howell, a war powers expert and associate professor at the University of Chicago,=
 said whatever the historical significance of last week's vote, Democrats have gained con=
siderable traction in opposing a wartime president because of the war's unpopularity.

=22It establishes this marker so that not now, but six months from now ... Democrats can hav=
e the momentum to (override) a presidential veto=22 if the war is still going badly, Howell=
 said. =22Just because it doesn't pass doesn't mean it's not of consequence.=22
