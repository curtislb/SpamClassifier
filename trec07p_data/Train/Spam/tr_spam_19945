/ color   pink name   gyrfalcon gerfalcon status   LC image   Falco
/ rusticolus.jpg regnum   Animalia phylum   Chordata classis   Aves ordo  
/ Falconiformes familia   Falconidae genus   [[Falcon/Falco]] species    F.
/ rusticolus  binomial   Falco rusticolus binomial_authority   Linnaeus, 1758
   The  Gyrfalcon   Falco rusticolus , also spelled  Gyr Falcon   the  g  is
pronounced as  j  in  jar  , and also sometimes spelled  Gerfalcon , is the
largest of all falcon species. The Gyrfalcon breeds on Arctic coasts and islands
of North America, Europe and Asia. It is mainly resident, but some Gyrfalcons
disperse more widely after the breeding season, or in winter. It is a bird of
tundra and mountains, with cliffs or a few patches of trees.

The Gyrfalcon is Iceland s national bird    ref Icelandic Wikipedia  Hann er
sta  fugl      slandi.    

The name comes from French gerfaucon, and is written in mediaeval Latin as
gyrofalco. The first part of the word may come from Old High German g  r   
modern German Geier     vulture , referring to its size compared to other
falcons. The male gyrfalcon is sometimes called a gyrkin

Description

These are very large falcons, at about the same size as the largest [[Buteo]]s .
Males are 48 to 61 cm  19 to 24 in  long, weigh 805 to 1350 g  1.8 to 3 lbs  and
have a wingspan from 110 to 130 cm  43 to 51 in . Females are rather bulkier and
larger at 51 to 65 cm  20 to 26 in  long, a weight of 1180 to 2100 g  2.6 to 4.6
lbs  and have a wingspan ranging from 124 to 160 cm  49 to 64 in .

This species is like a large Peregrine Falcon in general structure, but is broader 
winged and longer tailed than the Peregrine. The brown form of the Gyrfalcon is
distinguished from the Peregrine by the cream streaking on the nape and crown
and by the absence of a pronounced malar stripe and cap. White form Gyrfalcons
are unmistakable, as they are the only white falcons.

Diet The Gyrfalcon feeds only on birds and mammals. It usually hunts in a
horizontal pursuit, rather than the Peregrine s speedy stoop from a height. Most
prey is killed on the ground, whether they are captured there or, if the victim
is a flying bird, forced to the ground. The diet is to some extent
opportunistic, but a majority of breeding birds mostly rely on ptarmigans. Avian
prey can range in size from redpolls to geese and can include gulls, corvids,
smaller passerines, waders and other raptors  up to the size of Buteos .
Mammalian prey can range in size from shrews to marmots  sometimes 3 times
heavier than the assaulting falcon , and often includes include lemmings, voles,
ground squirrels and hares. They only rarely eat carrion.

Reproduction and life history

The Gyrfalcon almost invariably nests on cliff faces. Sometimes, the breeding
pair will build their own nests, but most nests are the abandoned nests of other
birds, particularly Golden Eagles and Common Ravens. The clutch can range from 1
to 5 eggs, but is usually 2 to 4. The average size of an egg is 58.46 x 45 mm
 2.31 x 1.8 in  and the average weight is 62 g  2.2 oz . The incubation period
averages 35 days, until the 52 g  1.8 oz  chicks hatch. The nestlings are
brooded usually for 10 to 15 days and leave the nest shortly thereafter. At 4 to
6 weeks of age, the immatures become independent of their parents, though they
may associate with their siblings through the following winter.

The only natural predator of gyrfalcons are Golden Eagles and even they rarely
harass these formidable falcons. Gyrfalcons have been recorded as aggressively
harassing animals that come near their nests, although Common Ravens are the
only predators known to successful pick off Gyrfalcon eggs and hatchlings. Even
Brown Bears may be dive bombed, much to their annoyance. Humans, whether
accidentally  automobile collisions or poisoning of carrion to kill mammalian
scavengers  or intentionally  through hunting , are the leading cause of death
for Gyrfalcons. Most Gyrfalcons that make it to adulthood live to about 9 to 12
years of age.

In falconry In medieval times, the Gyrfalcon was considered the king s bird. Due
to its rarity and the difficulties involved in obtaining it, in falconry the
gyrfalcon was generally reserved for kings and nobles. Very seldom was a man of
lesser rank seen with a Gyrfalcon on his fist.

Gyrfalcons are very expensive to buy, and thus owners and breeders may keep them
secret to avoid theft. They tend to fly long distances, and falconers may fit a
radio tracker to aid recovery.

Wild Gyrfalcons are not much exposed to disease, and as a result have weak
immune systems. As a result, many gyrfalcons taken from the wild quickly die of
disease. Several generations of captive breeding from the survivors causes
selection for a stronger immune system and thus better resistance to disease.

page 



Subspecies Plumage is very variable in this species. Often adults have slate 
grey back and wings, and young birds are browner. Sexes are similar. Greenland
Gyrfalcons have white plumage, flecked with grey on the back and wings. Other
geographical forms are varying intensities of grey in coloration  the Icelandic
form is the palest, and Eurasian forms are considerably darker. Natural
separation into regional subspecies is prevented by Gyrfalcons  habit of flying
long distances taking genes from one population into another. For example, one
known mating of a pair of captive Gyrfalcons produced a clutch of 4 young  one
white, one silver, one brown</STYLE>
