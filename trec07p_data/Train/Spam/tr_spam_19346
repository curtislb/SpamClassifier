Dear valued member!
It’s your therapist’s assistant writing to you. I just wanted to give you some really useful advice on how to shop for drugs online.
No matter how wide the choice of meds is, always try to cling to generic ones. Moreover, it would be better to purchase them from reliable pharmacies, such as USDrugs. Don’t forget that the pharmacy you shop at should be licensed.
Hope that you will find the information provided useful.Please click here for more information.
With Best Regards,  Chance Delgado
