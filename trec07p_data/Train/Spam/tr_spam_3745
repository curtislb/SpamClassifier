  Become Fit For Life!



HGH is a very complex molecule produced by the anterior lobe of the pituitary
gland, which is located at the base of the brain. While it stimulates growth
in children, it is important for maintaining a healthy body composition
and well-being in adults. It is the primary hormone that controls many
of the body's organs and it stimulates tissue repair, brain functions,
cell replacement, and enzyme function. Determining the levels of IGF-1
(Insulin Growth Factor) is how we measure HGH in the body.
