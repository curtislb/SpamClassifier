 William Marsh Rice University , commonly called  Rice University  and opened in
1912 as  The William Marsh Rice Institute for the Advancement of Letters,
Science and Art , is a private, comprehensive research university located in
Houston, Texas, USA, near the Museum District and adjacent to the Texas Medical
Center. Rice is particularly noted for its elite undergraduate division, as well
as its strength in the applied sciences. The university has been a pioneer in
the fields of nanotechnology ref  Nanotechnology  Science of the small could
drive big revolution .  May 21, 2004 . Houston Chronicle.  ref , artificial
heart research, structural chemical analysis, and space science.

Reputation


At the undergraduate level, Rice placed at 17th in the 2006 [[U.S. News   World
Report]] rankings of doctoral granting institutions. Further, in the Princeton
Review s 2007 rankings, Rice was ranked third for    Best Overall Academic
Experience for Undergraduates    as well as among the top 20 schools where
students    Never Stop Studying.    Hence the expression   Rice students never
leave the hedges,  referring to the plantings that both surround the campus and
line the academic quad. The same publication also placed it as first in the
nation for    Best Quality of Life    and    Lots of Race   Class
Interaction.   

Undergraduate admissions is highly selective [http   www.princetonreview.com co 
llege research profiles generalinfomore.asp?listing 1023709 ltid 1] with only
22  of its applicants for the Class of 2009 being offered a place. Of the 727
who enrolled, 76  were in their high school s top 5  with 19  of the total class
being valedictorians. Verbal SAT scores for this class were 660 and 760 for the
25th and 75th percentiles respectively, while SAT math scores were 670 and 780
at 25th and 75th percentiles. Enrollment at Rice will be rising in the next
several years, so expect rising application and or acceptance rates.
Approximately twenty percent of undergraduates are National Merit Scholars, and
Rice has often enrolled the highest percentage of National Merits in its
freshman class among American universities. Rice has also recently ranked first
for the percentage of its students receiving National Science Fellowships.

Comprehensively, the 2006 [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]],
popularized by [[The Economist]] and produced by Shanghai Jiao Tong University s
Institute of Higher Education, ranked Rice amongst the top 100 institutions
globally in terms of quality of scientific research leading towards numerous
awards  ref name  shanghai2    ref . Also, in the annual rankings by the [[The
Times Higher Education Supplement]], based on a subjective peer review by
scholars, Rice finished amongst the top 150 schools internationally
[http   www.timesonline.co.uk TGD picture 0,,348516,00.jpg]. These rankings
highlight the emphasis Rice places on its undergraduates, yet also signal the
schools ability to maintain a reputable research environment at the graduate
level. Indeed, Rice University possesses an endowment of $4.1 billion, fifth 
highest per student among U.S. universities. Being relatively generous with
these funds allows the university to charge lower tuition, room, and board than
most other prestigious private universities, as indicated by its $23,782 tuition
and $21,157 average freshman total need based gift aid, leading it to be
mentioned as a    Best Buy    school [http   www.princetonreview.com college re 
search profiles generalinfo.asp?listing 1023709 LTID 1]. Tuition for the 2007 
2008 school year is expected to be approximately $30,000. Please see Rice s
website for additional information.

Students All undergraduate students of Rice are members of the residential
college system, and there are no fraternities or sororities. The
[http   sa.rice.edu Student Association] is the university level student
government organization. The SA claims every undergraduate as a member. Rice s
undergraduate enrollment currently is about 3,000, with a student teacher ratio
of about 5 1. ref Rice University Office of Institutional Research, [http   www 
.professor.rice.edu professor Quick_Facts.asp?SnID 1003814005 studentinfo/ Quick
Facts, Fall 2005]  ref  Approximately two thirds of the students major in two or
more disciplines. Rice ranks highly among NCAA Division I A schools in the
graduation rate of student athletes. ref Rice Athletics,  Academic Awards and
Achievements,  [http   riceowls.cstv.com athleteservices academic awards.html/
RiceOwls.com]  ref  Seventy seven percent of the students reside on campus, and
intramural sport participation is the highest in the nation. Rice students are
locally known for being somewhat geeky and highly insulated from the outside
world  in a May 2005 Playboy magazine study, it was discovered that Rice
students were among the least sexually active of mid to high tier private
university students in the nation.
