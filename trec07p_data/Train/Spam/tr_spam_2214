]] , Helsinki]]  P  tanque  is a form of boules where the goal is to throw metal
balls as close as possible to a small wooden ball called a cochonnet  piglet .
The game is normally played on hard dirt or gravel, but can also be played on
grass or other surfaces. Sandy beaches are not suitable. Similar games are bocce
and bowls.

P  tanque is generally associated with southern France, particularly Provence,
whence it originates. It is the most played sport in Marseille. The casual form
of the game of P  tanque is played by about 17 million people in France  mostly
during their summer vacations . There are about 375,000 players licensed with
the F  d  ration Fran  aise de P  tanque et Jeu Proven  al  FFPJP . The FFPJP is
the 4th largest sporting federation in France. These licensed players play a
more competitive form of P  tanque known as P  tanque Sport.

History P  tanque is reputed to have been invented in 1907 in the village of La
Ciotat near Marseille as a less physically demanding form of [[jeu proven  al]].
Physical effort was reduced by shortening the length of the pitch by roughly
half and replacing a moving delivery with a stationary one. The name is derived
from the term pieds tanqu  s, which in the Marseilles dialect of French means
 stuck feet , because in P  tanque the feet have to remain fixed together within
a  small  circle. It is of interest that this also means that handicapped people
in wheelchairs can compete without any disadvantage. P  tanque has become so
popular that the term Jeu de Boules  game of balls  is often used to refer to
it, even though P  tanque is only one of several variants of boules. Many French
villages have a special stadium for the game called a Boulodrome.

The international P  tanque federation [http   www.boulepetanque.se int fipjp 
F  d  ration Internationale de P  tanque et Jeu Proven  al] was founded in 1958
in Marseille and has about 600,000 members in 52 countries  2002 .

The first World Championships were organized in 1959. The most recent
championships were held in Faro, Portugal  2000 , Monaco  2001 , Grenoble
 2002 , Geneva  2003 , Grenoble  2004 , Brussels  2005 , and Grenoble will host
2006. Fifty three countries participated in 2004 and the number is growing every
year.

Rules The game is always played in teams. In competitions there are three
different configurations 

  three players per team  two boules per player , called pairs
  two players per team  three boules per player , called doublets
  one player per team  three boules per player , called singles

The boules are made of metal and weigh between 650 g and 800 g, with a diameter
of between 71 mm and 80 mm. The jack is made of wood or synthetic material and
has a diameter of between 25 mm and 35 mm.

The playing area should be at least 15 meters  49 ft  long, by 4 meters  13 ft 
wide.

A player from the team that wins the toss starts the game by drawing a circle on
the playing field  35 to 50 cm in diameter . Both feet must be inside this
circle, touching the ground, when playing. The player then throws the jack to a
distance of between 6 and 10 metres from the starting circle. The jack must be
visible and at least 1 metre from any obstacle or boundary, otherwise it must be
thrown again.

A player from the team that wins the toss then plays the first boule, trying to
place it as close to the jack as possible. Then the opposing team must get
closer to the jack and keeps playing until they succeed. When they do, it is
back to the first team to do better, and so forth.

A player may choose to  place  a boule  get it as near as possible to the jack 
or  shoot  it  attempt to displace another boule . When one team runs out of
boules the other team plays their remaining boules. When all boules have been
played, that is the end of a  round , and the winning team scores a point for
each boule that is nearer to the jack than the opposing team s nearest boule.

Displacing the jack with a boule is allowed. It is an advantageous  albeit
dangerous  play for a skilled player late in a round, when all or most members
of his team have played long.

The team that wins a round starts the next one, and a new circle is drawn where
the jack ended up in the previous round.

If a boule completely crosses any of the predetermined boundaries, it is
considered dead and cannot be scored. Likewise, if the jack is moved and
subsequently completely crosses a boundary, the round is scratched and the jack
is thrown again. If only one team has boules remaining to throw when this
occurs, they receive points for every unplayed ball. Accordingly, the  extremely
difficult  play of deliberately shooting out the jack is a winning gambit in
some circumstances.  Points for boules in hand  is not, in fact, part of the
official rules of the game but is usually played anyway.

A complete game is usually played up to 13 points.

Strategy A successful p  tanque team has players who are skilled at shooting as
well as players who only point. For obvious reasons, the pointer or pointers
play first    the shooter or shooters are held in reserve in case the opponents
place well. In placing, a boule in front of the jack has much higher value than
one at the same distance behind the jack, because intentional or accidental
pushing of a front boule generally improves its position. At every play after
the very first boule has been placed, the team whose turn it is must decide
whether to point or shoot. Factors that count in that decision include 

 How close to the jack the opponents  best boule is,  The state of the terrain
 an expert pointer can practically guarantee to place within about six inches if
the terrain is well tended, not so if it s rocky or uneven , and  How many
boules each team has yet to play.

A team captain, in an idealized game, requires his pointer to place a boule in
front of the jack and reasonably close  paradoxically, in competition play the
first pointer aims not to get so close to the jack that the opponents will
inevitably shoot his or her boule immediately . He or she then visualizes an
imaginary circle with </STYLE>
