History Netcong received its name from the Musconetcong River, named by the
Lenape Native Americans and meaning  grass creek  or  swamp stream . Along with
the river, the proximity of the old Morris and Sussex Turnpike, which passed
through the region shortly after 1801, and the coming of the Morris Canal, in
1831, made the site a favorable one for development.

After becoming a Borough, the residents had to elect the first Governing Body.
The first Mayor was Abraham J. Drake, elected November 14, 1894. A census of
Netcong taken July of 1895 showed a population of 877 people.

Netcong derived much of its business from the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western
Railroad, which had its last stop in Morris County in the heart of the Borough.
The DL W s Sussex Branch to Branchville also stopped at Netcong Station, with
the Sussex Branch coming into the opposite side of the station from where New
Jersey Transit s line is today. The big railroad roundhouse in Port Morris also
supplied many jobs for the town
residents ref [http   www.netcong.org 260565.html Netcong  A Brief History],
accessed August 3, 2006  ref . NJ Transit currently operates weekday rail
service between Netcong and Hoboken Terminal, with service to Penn Station in
New York City via Midtown Direct.
