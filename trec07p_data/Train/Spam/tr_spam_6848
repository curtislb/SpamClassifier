middle   is the historic county town of Warwickshire in England and has a
population of 25,434  2001 census . The town lies upon the River Avon and is
located 18 km  11 miles  south of Coventry and 4 km  2.5 miles  west of
Leamington Spa.

Overview Warwick has many specialist independent shops, restaurants, pubs and
accommodation. It is spared the blight of multinational businesses and retains a
wonderful individual charm, now sadly lacking in so many other towns and cities.
There are internationally renowned annual festivals ranging from the Spoken Word
to Classical and Contemporary Music to a Folk Festival and the
[http   www.warwickchamberoftrade.co.uk Information Events Victorian_Evening 
World Famous Victorian Evening], held in late November or early December.
[http   www.warwickchamberoftrade.co.uk Warwick Chamber of Trade] helps to
promote the town for visitors, residents and businesses.

The town is also famous for Warwick Castle, the construction of which began in
1068, which attracts huge numbers of tourists from around the world. The town
centre is also known for its historic architecture, and contains a mixture of
Tudor and 17th century buildings.

Warwick School is an independent school for boys which claims to be the third 
oldest surviving school in England. The actual date of its founding is unknown,
although 914 has been quoted in some cases. For some years the school honoured
the fact that King Edward the Confessor  c.1004   1066  chartered it, although
there is no direct evidence for this, and King Henry VIII re founded the school
in 1545. Whatever the truth of the matter, there is no doubt that there has been
a grammar school in the town of Warwick since before the Norman Conquest, and
its successor, the present school, has been on its current site south of the
River Avon since 1879. Warwick School is part of the Warwick Schools Foundation
along with The King s High School For Girls and Warwick Preparatory School.
Other secondary schools in Warwick include Myton School and Aylesford school,
both state run co ed.

The University of Warwick, one of the leading universities in the UK, is
somewhat confusingly named after the  county  of Warwickshire, rather than the
town, and is in fact situated several miles north on the southern outskirts of
Coventry.

Warwick is also known for Warwick Racecourse, near the west gate of the medieval
town which hosts several televised meets a year. Within the racecourse is a
small golfcourse.

Warwick is twinned with Saumur in France and Verden in Germany. Warwick was
twinned with Saumur in 1976. Verden, already the twin town of Saumur, became
Warwick s German partner in 1989. Havelberg, in former East Germany was adopted
by Verden on re unification, and was welcomed as a friendship town by Warwick
and Saumur.

History by the west gate, Warwick]] According to tradition, Warwick was founded
on the banks of the River Avon in the year 914 AD, when Ethelfleda, sister of
Mercian king Edward the Elder built defences against Danish  Viking  invaders 
these were to be the basis of Warwick Castle. The name  Warwick  means
 dwellings by the weir .

In 1016 the Danes invaded Mercia and burned down much of Warwick, including the
nunnery  which stood on the site of the present day St Nicholas Church .

Its fortifications led Warwick to become an important administrative centre
within the Mercian kingdom. In the early 11th century Anglo Saxon England was
divided into administrative areas known as shires, and the shire administered
from Warwick became known as Warwickshire. By the time of Domesday Book, Warwick
was a royal borough.

In medieval times, Warwick remained under the control of various Earls of
Warwick, mostly of the Beauchamp family, and became a walled town. Today the
only remains of the town walls are the east and west gatehouses. The Eastern
gatehouse now serves as part of the King s High School, a sister institution to
Warwick School. Warwick was not incorporated as a town until 1545.

During the English Civil War the town and castle were garrisoned for Parliament,
Sir Edward Peyto withstanding a two week siege by the Royalists. Later musters
from 1644 to 1646 record a garrison of up to 350 men under the command of
Colonel Purefoy and Major John Bridges.  SP 28 121A 123  In 1694 a great fire
destroyed much of the town, and as a result most of the buildings in the town
centre are of 17th and 18th century origin, although a number of older medieval
buildings survive, especially around the edges of the town centre.

The fire burnt down much of the medieval church of St Mary  both the chancel and
the Beauchamp Chapel, however, survived, the latter having been built between
1443 and 1464 according to the wishes of Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick  who
had died in Rouen in 1439 . A full size reclining copper gilt effigy of the Earl
lies upon his Purbeck marble tomb   a fine piece of medieval metalwork cast in
1459.

Transport Warwick is near the M40 motorway and the A46 trunk road. The town also
has good rail links, with direct services to London, Birmingham and Stratford upon 
Avon provided by Chiltern Railways from Warwick Station in the town and also
from Warwick Parkway, a new out of town station opened in 2000 a few miles from
the town. In addition, a few peak hour trains to and from Birmingham are
operated by Central Trai</STYLE>
