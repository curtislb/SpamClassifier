 John Quincy Adams   July 11, 1767     February 23, 1848  was a diplomat,
politician, and President of the United States  March 4, 1825     March 4,
1829 . His party affiliations were Federalist, Democratic Republican, National
Republican, and later Whig. Adams was the son of U.S. President John Adams, and
Abigail Adams. He is most famous as a diplomat involved in many international
negotiations, and for formulating the Monroe Doctrine. As president he proposed
a grand program of modernization and educational advancement, but was unable to
get it through Congress. Late in life, as a Congressman, he was a leading
opponent of the Slave Power, arguing that if a civil war ever broke out the
president could abolish slavery by using his war powers, a policy followed by
Abraham Lincoln in the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863.

Early life Adams was born in Braintree, Massachusetts in a part of town which
eventually became Quincy. The John Quincy Adams birthplace, now part of Adams
National Historical Park, is open to the public, as is the nearby Abigail Adams
Cairn that marks the site from which Adams witnessed the Battle of Bunker Hill
as a seven year old boy. He first learned of the Declaration of Independence
from the letters his father wrote his mother from Philadelphia. Much of Adams 
youth was spent overseas accompanying his father, who served as an American
envoy to France from 1778 until 1779 and to the Netherlands in 1780. During this
period, he acquired his early education at institutions such as the University
of Leiden. For nearly two years, he accompanied Francis Dana on a mission to St.
Petersburg, Russia, to gain recognition to the new republic. He also spent time
in Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Germany.

During these years overseas, Adams gained a mastery of French and Dutch and a
familiarity with German and other European languages. After returning to
America, he had become far more worldly and well travelled than most of his
countrymen even twice his age. He entered Harvard College and graduated in 1787.
He was then admitted to the bar and began practicing law in Boston.

Early political career ]] George Washington appointed Adams as minister to the
Netherlands from 1794 until 1796 and to Portugal in 1796. With George
Washington s urging, his father appointed him minister to Prussia from 1797
until 1801. While serving abroad, he married Louisa Catherine Johnson, the
daughter of an American merchant.

Adams afterwards returned to Quincy where he lived in the Old House  now a
museum . He began his political career in 1802 when he was elected to the
Massachusetts Senate. Adams was an unsuccessful Federalist candidate for
election to the U.S. House of Representatives in the same year. He was elected
as a Federalist to the U.S. Senate, serving from March 4, 1803, until June 8,
1808, when he broke with the Federalists and became a Republican.

Adams served as minister to Russia from 1809 until 1814, chief negotiator of the
U.S. commission for the Treaty of Ghent in 1814, and minister to the Court of
St. James  Great Britain  from 1815 until 1817.

Secretary of State

Adams served as Secretary of State in the Cabinet of President James Monroe from
1817 until 1825, a tenure during which he was instrumental in the acquisition of
Florida. Typically, his views were concurrent with those espoused by Monroe. As
secretary of state, he negotiated the Adams On  s Treaty and wrote the Monroe
Doctrine, which cautioned European nations against meddling in the affairs of
the Western Hemisphere.

Election of 1824

Adams ran against four other candidates in the Presidential election of 1824.
His opponents included Speaker of the House Henry Clay, Secretary of the
Treasury William H. Crawford, Tennessee senator Andrew Jackson and John Calhoun.
After Crawford suffered a stroke there was no clear favorite. After the
elections no one had a majority of either the electoral votes or the popular
votes, although Andrew Jackson was the winner of a plurality of both. The
decision went to the House of Representatives. The candidate with the lowest
votes, Henry Clay, was dropped from consideration, and Clay gave his support to
Adams. Adams won on the first ballot and was named president. Adams then named
Clay Secretary of State to the angry complaints of Andrew Jackson, who alleged a
corrupt bargain and vowed to run again in 1828.

Presidency 1825   1829 Adams served as the sixth President of the United States
from March 4, 1825, to March 4, 1829.

Domestic policies During his term, he worked on developing the American System,
consisting of a high tariff to support internal improvements such as road 
building, and a national bank to encourage productive enterprise and form </STYLE>
