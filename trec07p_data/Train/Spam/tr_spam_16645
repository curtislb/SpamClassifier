<center><=21--Sunni militants are believed to have withdrawn to surrounding areas such=
 as Diyala province where they have safe haven. The U.S. command also deployed an extra 700 s=
oldiers to the area last month.

A U.S. soldier also was killed Monday in a roadside bombing in Muqdadiyah, about 60 miles no=
rth of Baghdad, a predominantly Shiite area that also is in Diyala, the military said in an e=
arlier statement. A British soldier was shot to death while on patrol in the southern city o=
f Basra, officials said.

The deaths raised to 85 the number of U.S. service members who died have in        Iraq in April, mak=
ing it the deadliest month for American troops since December, when 112 died.

It was the single deadliest attack on ground forces since Dec. 1, 2005, when a roadside bomb=
 killed 10 Marines and wounded 11 on a foot patrol near Fallujah.

Twelve soldiers died when a Black Hawk helicopter crashed in Diyala on Jan. 20. The militar=
y said it might have been shot down but the investigation is still ongoing.

In other devastating attacks, 14 Marines were killed when a roadside bomb struck an amphib=
ious assault vehicle near the western town of Haditha on Aug. 3, 2005. And a suicide bomber s=
truck a mess tent in a base near Mosul on Dec. 21, 2004, killing 22 people, including 14 U.S. s=
oldiers and three American contractors.
