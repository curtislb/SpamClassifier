The  ocean sunfish ,  pez luna ,  moon fish , or  common mola , Mola mola, is
the heaviest bony fish in the world. It is a unique pelagic fish, and specimens
of ocean sunfish have been observed up to 3.3 m  11 ft  in length and weighing
up to 2,300 kg  5,100 lb . ref name  fishbase    FishBase_species /genus Mola
/species mola /year 2006 /month March     ref 

A member of the order Tetraodontiformes, the ocean sunfish has many derived
characters and is the type species of its genus.

The ocean sunfish feeds on jellyfish and other gelatinous, soft bodied
zooplankton, as well as small fish and other marine life.

Physiology The ocean sunfish is described as a flat, oval fish with grooves on
its body. It has a rounded  tail  known as a clavus instead of a caudal fin. The
short, broad clavus is formed by extensions of dorsal and anal fin rays. It is
wavy, with eight to nine ossicles and 12 fin rays. The ocean sunfish has rough,
sandpapery skin covered with mucus. Its average weight is 900 kg  one ton  and
its average length from the tip of the snout to the tip of its clavus is .
Vertically, from fin to fin, its average size is . The ocean sunfish is taller
than it is long and has large, high dorsal and anal fins, which are dark in
color. Its tiny mouth cannot be closed and its top and bottom teeth are fused to
form a beak. It has round, bulging eyes, and its skin is extremely thick and
elastic. There is a distinct line at the posterior where denticles, scales, on
the skin change from extremely rough to very fine. Its pectoral fins are small,
fan shaped, and pointed upwards. It has four gills and a slit behind the last
one is covered by a thin flap of skin near the pectoral fin called an operculum.



The spinal column of m. mola contains less vertebrae than any other fish, and
the spinal cord is under 25 mm  1 in  long. ref http   www.montereybayaquarium. 
com efc living_species default.asp?hOri 0 hab 8 inhab 130  ref  A specimen of
200 kg may have a brain no bigger than a nut. The fish s unusual shape results
from its unique development, in which the tail does not grow with the rest of
the body. As the rest of the body grows to the enormous adult size, it  wraps
around  where the tail would normally be, giving the squared,  cut off  shape of
the adult mola tail.

Juveniles are silvery in color and adults are usually dark gray to white, with
variations in mottling and spots. Ocean sunfish are usually grey above, silvery
grey to brown on the side, and paler or dusky below  some individuals are brown.
It is able to change color rapidly from spotty to even colored.

Though unrelated, ocean sunfish are commonly mistaken for sharks, as they often
swim close to the surface and have dorsal fins that protrude from the water,
similar to the dorsal fins of sharks. They are found in warm and temperate zones
of all oceans, including the eastern Pacific and the eastern and western
Atlantic. There are three to five species of Mola.

Fins Like the triggerfishes and pufferfishes it is related to, Mola mola uses
its long, thin dorsal and anal fins for propulsion  it lacks a caudal fin  or
 tail fin  , having in its place a rudder like structure, the clavus. Its fry
resemble miniature pufferfish, having spines which provide a hint at the
species  place in the evolutionary tree. The ocean sunfish uses its dorsal and
anal fins to  scull.  This tetraodontiform behavior is a method of propulsion
allowing the fish to swim forward by moving its dorsal and anal fins from side
to side.

Toxins While the flesh of the ocean sunfish is considered a delicacy by some, it
contains neurotoxins similar to those of other poisonous tetraodontiformes. ref
name  fishbase     ref 

Diet Ocean sunfish eat jellyfishes, salps, comb jellies, zooplankton, squid, and
crustaceans. They live in the Eastern Pacific and Atlantic. Despite the soft and
watery nature of their food, it is densely packed with proteins, vitamins and
minerals, and occurs in vast swarms. This, and the mola s huge appetite, allow
it to grow larger than any other bony fish. Its predators, often smaller than
the mola itself, are orcas, sea lions, dolphins and marlin. Orcas are the only
likely predators of large adults.

Reproduction Molas can produce more than 300 million eggs, each about 2 to 3 mm
in diameter, more than any other known vertebrate. ref name  fishbase     ref 

Life Individuals are thought to live for more than 10 years. Interestingly, the
rough and leathery skin  a fibrous tissue up to 15 mm thick  of the ocean
sunfish is host to more dermal parasites than that of any other marine creature.

Behavior


Ocean sunfish are generally thought to be solitary fish, swimming freely in the
ocean alone. However, certain sightings of molas in groups of more than ten have
been reported. Juvenile ocean sunfish are said to socialize and gather in
schools.

Sometimes molas are spotted floating sideways on the sea surface. Although many
scientists are still puzzled at this behavior, it is commonly thought that they
are basking in the sun, not sick or unhealthy. Some observers have seen sea
birds such as gulls picking ectoparasites off of basking ocean sunfish, another
plausible explanation for why the mola would float on the sur</STYLE>
