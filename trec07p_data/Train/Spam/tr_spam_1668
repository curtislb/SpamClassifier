 tortoise  is a land dwelling reptile of the order Testudines.

Like their aquatic cousins, the turtles, tortoises are shielded from predators
by a shell. The top part of the shell is the carapace, the underside is the
plastron, and the two are connected by the bridge. The tortoise has both an
endoskeleton and an exoskeleton. Tortoises can vary in size from a few
centimetres to two meters. Most land tortoises are herbivorous in the wild.  The
following is not an accurate statement  The carapace can help indicate the age
of the tortoise by the number of concentric rings, much like the cross section
of a tree.  The growth of a tree or a tortoise depends highly on the access of
food and water. A tortoise that has access to plenty of forage will grow faster
than a desert tortoise that goes days without eating.  The following information
depends on the tortoise species.  Males tend to have a longer, protruding neck
plate than their female counterparts. 

Tortoises tend to be diurnal animals with tendencies to be crepuscular depending
on the ambient temperatures. They are generally reclusive and shy.

Most land based tortoises are herbivores, feeding on grazing grasses, weeds,
leafy greens, flowers, and certain fruits. Their main diet consists of alfalfa,
clover, dandelions, and leafy weeds.

Female tortoises dig and lay about a dozen eggs in burrows or holes they dig.
Hatchlings take approximately 90 120 days to incubate from ping pong ball sized
eggs. The hatchlings break out of their shells with a front beak. Most
hatchlings are born with an embryonic egg sac, serving as a source of food for
the first couple of days. They are capable of eating solid food in about 3 7
days.

The giant tortoises of the Gal  pagos Islands helped Charles Darwin formulate
his theory of evolution, since the isolated populations on the different
islands, although descended from a common ancestor, had diverged to different
forms.

The first turtles already existed in the era of the dinosaurs, some 300 million
years ago. Turtles and tortoises are the only surviving branch of the even more
ancient clade Anapsida, which includes groups such as the procolophonoids,
millerettids and pareiasaurs. Most of the anapsids became extinct in the late
Permian period, with the exception of the procolophonoids and the precursors of
the testudines  turtles and tortoises .

While the Oxford English Dictionary refers to a tortoise as a  slow moving land
reptile with a scaly or leathery domed shell into which it can retract its head
and legs  [http   www.askoxford.com concise_oed tortoise?view uk], in American
English it is not uncommon for such animals to be referred to incorrectly as
turtle.

Lifespan Tortoises generally have lifespans comparable with those of human
beings, and some individuals are known to have lived longer than 150 years.
Because of this, they symbolize longevity in some cultures, such as China. The
oldest tortoise ever recorded, indeed the oldest individual animal ever
recorded, was Tui Malila, who was presented to the Tongan royal family by the
British explorer Captain Cook shortly after its birth in 1777. Tui Malila
remained in the care of the Tongan royal family until its death by natural
causes on May 19, 1965. This means that upon its death, Tui Malila was 188 years
old [http   www.foxnews.com story 0,2933,200831,00.html].

The Alipore Zoo in India was the home to Adwaitya, which zoo officials claimed
was the oldest living animal until its death on March 23, 2006. Adwaitya
 sometimes spelled with two d s  was an Aldabra Giant Tortoise brought to India
by Lord Wellesley who handed it over to the Alipur Zoological Gardens in 1875
when the zoo was set up. Zoo officials state they have documentation showing
that Adwaitya was at least 130 years old, but claim that he was over 250 years
old  although this has not been scientifically verified . Adwaitya was said to
be the pet of Robert Clive
