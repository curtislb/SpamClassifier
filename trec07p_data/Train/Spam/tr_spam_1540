   The  Aldabra Giant Tortoise   Geochelone gigantea , from the islands of the
Aldabra Atoll in the Seychelles, is one of the largest tortoises in the world.
Similar in size to the famous Galapagos Giant Tortoise, its carapace averages
120 cm  47 inches  in length. The average weight of a male is around 250 kg  551
pounds , but one male at the Fort Worth Zoological Park weighs over 360 kg  793
pounds . This species is widely referred to as Geochelone gigantea but is now
placed in the genus [[Dipsochelys]]  or sometimes in the invalid genus
[[Aldabrachelys]]  as Dipsochelys dussumieri.

Anatomy and Morphology The shell is a dark gray or black color with a high domed
shape. It has stocky, heavily scaled legs to support its heavy body. The neck of
the Aldabra Giant Tortoise is very long, even for its great size, which helps
the animal to exploit tree branches up to a meter from the ground as a food
source.

Females are generally smaller than males, with average specimens measuring 90 cm
 35 inches  in length and weighing 150 kg  330 pounds .

Range and Distribution The main population of the Aldabra Giant Tortoise resides
on the islands of the Aldabra Atoll in the Seychelles. The atoll has been
protected from human influence and is home to some 152,000 giant tortoises, the
world s largest population of the animal. Another isolated population of the
species resides on the island of Zanzibar. The tortoises exploit many different
kinds of habitat including grasslands, low scrub, mangrove swamps, and coastal
dunes.

Ecology and Life History Habitat A peculiar kind of habitat has evolved due to
the grazing pressures of the tortoises   tortoise turf,  a comingling of 21
species of grasses and herbs. Many of these distinct plants are naturally
dwarfed and grow their seeds not from the tops of the plants, but closer to the
ground to avoid the tortoises  close cropping jaws.

As the largest animal in its environment, the Aldabra tortoise performs a role
similar to that of the elephant. Their vigorous search for food fells trees and
creates pathways used by other animals. ]]

Feeding Ecology Primarily herbivores, Aldabra Tortoises will eat grasses,
leaves, and woody plant stems. They occasionally indulge in small invertebrates
and carrion, even eating the bodies of other dead tortoises. In captivity,
Aldabra Giant Tortoises are known to enjoy fruits such as apples and bananas as
well as compressed vegetable pellets.

There is little fresh water available for drinking in the tortoises  natural
habitat, therefore they obtain most of their moisture from their food.


The Aldabra tortoise has two main varieties of shell. Specimens living in
habitats with food available primarily on the ground have a more dome shaped
shell with front extending downward over the neck. Those living in an
environment with food available higher up off the ground have a more flattened
topped shell with the front raised to allow the neck to extend upward freely.

Behavior Aldabra tortoises are found both individually and in herds, which tend
to gather mostly on open grasslands. They are most active in the mornings when
they spend time browsing for food. They dig underground burrows or rest in
swamps to keep cool during the heat of the day.

]]

While they are characteristically slow and cautious, they are capable of
appreciable speed, especially when tempted with a treat. They are also known to
attempt perilous acrobatic feats, rising precariously on their hind legs to
reach low branches. They risk death by tipping onto their backs and being unable
to right themselves.

They are also excellent swimmers, being naturally buoyant. This factor has
allowed the spread and eventual speciation of many kinds of related tortoises
across the Indian Ocean.

The tortoises are not domestic or tame, but they are remarkably indifferent to
the presence of humans. They do not seem to have any fear of people  some even
seek them out for attention. Some like to have their heads patted, others enjoy
having their necks scratched where they meet their plastron.

Life History Large tortoises are among the longest lived animals on the planet.
Some individual Aldabra Giant Tortoises are thought to be over 100 years of age,
but this is difficult to verify because they tend to outlive their human
observers. Adwaitya  The One and Only  was reputedly one of four brought by
British seamen from the Seychelles Islands as gifts to Robert Clive of the
British East India Company in the 18th century and came to Kolkata Zoo in 1875.
At its death in March 2006 at the Kolkata  formerly Calcutta  Zoo in India,
Adwaitya is reputed to have reached the longest ever measured life span of 255
years  birth year 1750 , although the accuracy of this is disputed due to a lack
of contemporary records.

In Captivity The Aldabra tortoise is recently becoming more available in the pet
trade. The price still makes them somewhat of an exclusive animal, costing
between $1,000 and $20,500 depending on size as of 2006. Care for these
tortoises requires a good deal of commitment. They are very powerful as adults,
and can be destructive in a typical suburban setting  capable of ramming through
fences and doors. Fairly expensive accommodations are necessary to contain these
tortoises and keep them at a co</STYLE>
