 Patchogue    pach og,  pach   g  is a village in Suffolk County, New York,
United States. The population was 11,919 at the 2000 census.

The village is named after the Patchogue Indians, who once inhabited the area.

The  Village of Patchogue  is within the Town of Brookhaven, on the South Shore
of Long Island on the Great South Bay.

 The Patchogue area is not neatly divided into North, East, etc. For additional
demographic and geographic information on the area also see [[North Patchogue,
New York/North Patchogue]] and [[East Patchogue, New York/East Patchogue]].

Overview Patchogue is about 55 miles east of Manhattan. It was incorporated in
1893. A riverfront and a natural harbor are natural resources that the town has
used for the past 100 years to become a modern and largely self contained
community.

The current mayor of Patchogue is Paul Pontieri, who was a vice principal in the
neighboring South Country School District s Bellport High School for many years
and currently serves as a vice principal in Ward Melville High School in Three
Village School District.

Patchogue and the adjacent hamlet of Medford share a school district and
library. There are Primary, Middle and High Schools, plus continuing education
programs for adults and an emphasis on sports. The School District combines with
the St. Joseph s and the Briarcliff Colleges to give what some say is a strong
commitment to local education.

The Patchogue Theatre for the Performing Arts is a local venue for plays and the
like. At one time a movie theatre, it has been fully renovated and seats more
than a thousand. The lobby can hold receptions and has a full service bar.

Patchogue has churches of many denominations. The Patchogue Chamber of Commerce
with more than 400 members, Kiwanis, Rotarians and Lions join the religious
institutions to provide support and voice to residents and business people in
the town. The Patchogue Ambulance Company is an all volunteer effort. The
Lighthouse Mission feeds more than a thousand poor people each week, and
provides spiritual support and school supplies.

The Brickhouse Brewery and Restaurant serves both alcoholic beverages and food.
It is located in the former Shands Hardware Store which is 150 year old
institution.

History Patchogue was nicknamed Milltown because of the many mills   
gristmills, sawmills, paper, wool, cotton mills    that operated on Patchogue
waterways from as early as 1750. The village s permanent name may have derived
from Pochaug or Paushag, which were the early settlers  interpretation of the
name of Indians who lived in the vicinity.

Area residents once set their clocks by the noon whistle from the giant red 
brick Patchogue Plymouth Lace Mill, which closed in 1954 and was demolished in
the mid 1990s. Most of the mills succumbed in the 1940s and 1950s, as a result
of foreign competition and the industry movement to the South and overseas for
cheaper labor.

According to Marjorie Roe, president of the Greater Patchogue Historical
Society, the Lace Mill was once known as  the Patchogue College because so many
Patchogue kids went there when they finished high school.  Charles E. Merrill, a
co founder of brokerage firm Merrill Lynch   Co., worked at the mill from 1907 
1909. Workers also came by stagecoach from Sayville and other South Shore
communities. The mill employed as many as 1,200 during World War II, when it
manufactured camouflage netting and other war products.

Paradoxically, the Lace Mill s biggest problem may have been that its products
were too good.  They lasted forever and never had to be replaced   I still use a
lace tablecloth my mother bought in the  30s,  says Roe, a sixth generation
descendant of Capt. Austin Roe, a chief spy for General George Washington during
the American Revolutionary War.

Justus Roe, Capt. Roe s son, built Patchogue s first hotel in 1808, and the
family continued building ever larger hotels throughout the 19th century.
Patchogue was then a bustling seaport with fishing, oyster and boat building
industries as well as mills on the Patchogue River and Great South Bay.

Patchogue s recorded history dates from 1664, when John Winthrop, the Younger,
Governor of Connecticut, purchased  nine necks of land  extending from Great
South Bay to the middle of the Island. He sold some to Humphrey Avery of Boston,
who, in need of cash, disposed of them by lottery. In 1759, Leoffer d Leofferda
won the  lot  that ultimately became Patchogue.

Settlers and shipping entrepreneurs soon flocked to the area, attracted by
waterpower. Schooners set out from Patchogue to do commerce up and down the East
Coast and even to the Mediterranean.

In 1890, the Army Corps of Engineers dredged the Patchogue River, making it the
only deep water port on Long Island s South Shore. Until 1922, Patchogue was a
U.S. port of entry with a customs house on South Ocean Avenue.

The port also attracted bootleggers during Prohibition in the 1920s. New York
City gangster Dutch Schultz set up a headquarters in Patchogue, giving lucrative
employment to farm boys, who helped unload and hide the kegs of illegal liquor.

The Long Island Rail Road came to Patchogue in 1869. For awhile the South Shore
line ended at Patchogue. It brought thousands of summer visitors from New York
City, seeking the cool southwest breezes. The village, which incorporated in
1893, became a summer colony, with hotels accommodating as many as 1,600 guests.
It was also the starting point for bicycle races. The last of the Roe family s
hotels, the Eagle Hotel, burned down in 1934.

Tourism gradually declined after 1920 as the now affordable motor car took
tourists to farther destinations, notes village co historian Hans Henke in a
pictorial history of Patchogue in its boom years from 1840 to 1915. The
legendary Catholic high school, Seton Hall, operated by the Sisters of Charity
of Halifax  Halifax, Nova Scotia  operated on the property now occupied by St
Joseph s College on Roe Blvd. The school closed its doors in 1974.

Community reinvigoration plans As of 2005, Village co historian Anne Swezey and
the Greater Patchogue Historical Society hope to bring back the tourist
industry, if not the mills. They have restored the 1858 one room schoolhouse,
and the village hopes to reopen the Patchogue movie house of </STYLE>
