health of the individual is intimately bound with the adaptive demands
placed him by the environment. One of followers, Dr. Lawrence E. Hinkle,
Jr., has this the "human ecology" approach to medicine, has argued
passionately disease need not be the result of single, specific agent, such
as germ virus, but consequence many factors, including the general nature
the environment surrounding the body. Hinkle has for years to sensitize the
profession to the of environmental factors 
medicine. Today, with spreading over air pollution, pollution, urban
crowding and other factors, more and more health authorities coming around
to the ecological notion that individual needs to seen as part of system,
and that his health dependent upon many subtle external factors. It another
of Wolff's however, Dr. Thomas H. Holmes, came up with idea that change,
itself not or that specific change the general rate of 
in person's life could be one of most important environmental factors of
all. from Cornell, Holmes is now at the of Washington School of Medicine,
and was there, with the help of young psychiatrist named Rahe, that he
created an ingenious tool named the Life-Change Scale. This was device for
how much change an individual experienced in given span of Its development
was an important breakthrough, making it for the first time, to qualify, at
crudely, the rate of change in 
life. Reasoning that different of life-changes strike us with force, Holmes
and Rahe by listing as many changes as they could. divorce, move to home

others. vacation trip, for example, may represent pleasant break in the
routine. Yet it hardly compare in impact with, the death of parent. Holmes
and 
next took their of life-changes to thousands men and women in many of life
in the States and Japan. Each person was asked rank order the items on the
list to how much impact each had. Which required great deal coping or
adjustment- ones were relatively minor- To Holmes' and Rahe's it turned out
that is widespread agreement among people as which changes in their lives
require 
adaptations and which ones comparatively unimportant. This agreement about
the "impact-fullness" various life events extends even across and language
barriers. (The in the United States and Japan now being supplemented studies
in France, Belgium the Netherlands.)‡People tend to and to agree on changes
hit the hardest. Given this information, Holmes Rahe were able to assign
numerical 
to each type of change. Thus each item on their list ranked by its
magnitude and score accordingly. example, if the death of one's is rated as
hundred points, then moving new home is rated by people as worth only twenty
points, thirteen. (The death of spouse, incidentally, is universally
regarded as the single most change that can befall person
