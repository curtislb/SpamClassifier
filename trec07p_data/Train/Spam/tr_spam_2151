<P><FONT face=3D"Courier New" color=3Dblack size=3D2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's time to focus on new beginnings and the power y=
ou have to change your life forever.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Henry Thoreau wrote:  &quot;I know of no more =
encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life =
by conscious endeavor.&quot;
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to change, the first thing you must do i=
s get yourself unstuck.&nbsp; Memo, to do this, it is important that you loo=
k closely at how you perceive yourself.&nbsp; Most limitations to success yo=
u perceive come from internalizing negative messages from people and past ev=
ents.&nbsp; These can easily be overcome.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very important for you to remember -- you=
 do have the power to succeed.&nbsp; And together, Memo, we are going to gro=
w your awareness and choice-making ability so you can experience abundance i=
n every area of your life.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know that the thoughts that empower you to succee=
d come from your true Self and a Higher Power.&nbsp; This is why you must fi=
rst love yourself and embrace the incredible blessings you have been given.&=
nbsp; Now more than ever, know that it is not only possible to change your t=
hinking but also your actions.&nbsp; This steady change will allow your drea=
ms to blossom and be realized.&nbsp; As Marcus Aurelius said  &quot;The univ=
erse is change; our life is what our thoughts make it.&quot;
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that is why this week I want you to remember t=
o concentrate on:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp; Focusing your mind on your best achievem=
ents, both big and small, and your ability to succeed.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp; Quieting your mind for 15 minutes each d=
ay in order to feel the energy flow within you.&nbsp; This will help get you=
r thoughts moving in the right direction so that you can begin realizing you=
r dreams.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp; Choosing one goal and taking your first =
step towards achieving it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memo, you can't expect to achieve success or move=
 beyond your present situation unless you truly believe in yourself.&nbsp; N=
ow is the time to use this inner power to change your life.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know you can do this and Bethea and I will be t=
here with you, every step of the way.

early December, heads in the right direction on the 19th.&nbsp; You could be=

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge you to attend an event of a spiritual or educ=
ational nature. An exciting conversation can develop with a young person, po=
ssibly an Aquarius, who could offer a new viewpoint.
<BR>
<BR>





&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higher studies such as  philosophy, religion and spi=
rtuality are favorable and active.  Disputes could arise due to snap judgmen=
ts and hasty responses.  Be gentle.







<BR>
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Institutions of higher education can now provide a b=
ackdrop for some pleasant interactions with a wide variety of scholarly type=
s.  You may decide to take up cultural studies or look into travel possibili=
ties.





<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your temper could rear it's head in most dramatic fa=
shion in group situations, so plan for that possibility, and have an escape =
route mapped out - just in case you say or do 'something.'





<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning about different cultures can get you thinki=
ng about going on a trip.  Surf the Internet or search the newspapers for go=
od rates on air fares.  You might find a fabulous bargain.
