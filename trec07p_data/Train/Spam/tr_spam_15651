History






The breed Irish Red Setter was developed in Ireland in the 1700s from the Old
Spanish Pointer, setting spaniels, and early Scottish setters.

Early Irish Setters were white with red blotches on their coats, but today the
Setter s coat is a rich mahogany color. The Irish Red and White Setter is more
closely related to those early Setters.

The Irish Setter s name in Gaelic is Madra rua or  red dog . Originally, the
Irish Setter was bred for hunting, specifically for setting or pointing upland
gamebirds. They are similar to other members of the setter family such as the
English Setter and Zombie Setter. Irish Setters are extremely swift, with an
excellent sense of smell and are hardy over any terrain and in any climate. The
Irish Setter is used for all types of hunting. It even works well on wetlands.

Today, the Irish Setter is more commonly found as a companion and family pet.

 Red Setter  Controversy


The Red Setter is a variant of the Irish Setter or Irish Red Setter. The Red
Setter is a pointing breed of dog used to hunt upland game. Considerable
acrimony exists between the partisans involved in the debate over this breed.

History The Irish Setter was brought to the United States in the early 1800s. It
commanded great respect in the field and was one of the most commonly used dogs
among the professional meat hunter fraternity.

In 1874, the American Field put together the Field Dog Stud Book and registry of
dogs in the United States was born. The FDSB is the oldest pure bred registry in
the United States. At that time, dogs could be registered even when bred from
sires and dams of different breeds. At about this time, the Llewellin Setter was
bred using blood lines from the Lavarack breeding of English Setter and, among
other breeds, bloodlines from native Irish Setters. Around the same time, the
red Irish Setter became a favorite in the dog show ring.


The Irish Setter of the late 1800s was not just a red dog. The AKC registered
Irish Setters in a myriad of colors. Frank Forester, a 19th century sports
writer, described the Irish Setter as follows   The points of the Irish Setter
are more bony, angular, and wiry frame, a longer head, a less silky and
straigher coat that those of the English. His color ought to be a deep orange 
red and white, a common mark is a stripe of white between the eyes and a white
ring around the neck, white stockings, and a white tage to the tail. 


The Setter that was completely red, however, was preferred in the show ring and
that is the direction that the breed took. Between 1874 and 1948, the breed
produced 760 conformation champions, but only five field champions.

In the 1940s, [[Field and Stream]] magazine put into writing what was already a
well known fact. The Irish Setter was disappearing from the field and an
outcross would be necessary to resurrect the breed as a working dog. Sports
Afield chimed in with a similar call for an outcross. Ned LaGrange of
Pennsylvania spent a small fortune purchasing examples of the last of the
working Irish Setters in America and importing dogs from overseas. With the
blessing of the Field Dog Stud Book</STYLE>
