History Legend has it that the borough s name is derived from early settlers who
bought the piece of land now known as Rumson from the Native Americans for some
rum. But as far back as 1663, long before the area was officially named Rumson,
Native Americans called it    Navarumsunk   . Over the years it has been
shortened to    Rumson   . In 1907, Rumson was officially incorporated as a
Borough. Other names Rumson has been known by include Black Point, Port
Washington, and Oceanic. ref [http   www.rumsonboro.com history.htm Rumson
Borough Website], accessed September 06,2006  ref 

Rumson was purchased by English settlers in pieces. The first purchase is dated
January 25, 1665, and it included parts of Middletown. The rest of the area was
purchased April 7, 1665 and June 5, 1665.

There are many old, historic homes in Rumson, but the oldest ever was the 700 
acre Tredwell House, named after a family that summered here for almost 100
years. The oldest part of the house being from 1670, it was the second oldest
building in Monmouth County as of June 2006, when it was destroyed by fire ref

Burning questions], [[Asbury Park Press]], June 16, 2006  ref .

Residents of Rumson in the 19th Century enjoyed many activities, such as
swimming in the adjacent Navesink River, the Atlantic Ocean, or taking a wagon
ride. In winter, they used the river for ice boating.

Rumson has always been a very affluent area. In fact, it is still one of the
wealthiest towns in New Jersey. The homes are spectacularly large, Locals enjoy
the beautiful beaches just over the Sea Bright Bridge, as well as a quick
commuter ferry to downtown Manhattan.
