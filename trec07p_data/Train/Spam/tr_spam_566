 Bayonne   French  Bayonne, pronounced   Gascon Occitan and Basque  Baiona  is a
city and commune of southwest France at the confluence of the Nive and Adour
rivers, in the Pyr  n  es Atlantiques [[D  partements of France/d  partement]],
of which it is a [[sous pr  fecture]].

Together with nearby Anglet, Biarritz, Saint Jean de Luz, and several smaller
communes, Bayonne forms an urban area with 178,965 inhabitants at the 1999
census, 40,078 of whom lived in the city of Bayonne proper  44,300 as of 2004
estimates .

The communes of Bayonne, Biarritz, and Anglet have joined into an intercommunal
entity called the [[Communaut   d agglom  ration de Bayonne Anglet Biarritz]].

Bayonne is the main town of Labourd in the French Basque Country.

History

In the 3rd century AD, the area was the site of a Roman [[castrum]], named
Lapurdum. It was a military place, but not a port. In 840, the Vikings appeared
before Lapurdum. In 842, they launched a large scale inland offensive and
settled outside the city on the river bank. Lapurdum was an oppidum and they
needed a port. Bayonne  from basque bai  river   became a key place on the route
between the Adour and Ebro Rivers, which served as a kind of link between the
Atlantic and the Mediterranean. This commercial route was the main goal of
Danish invaders in France. By this route, they could easily reach Tortosa, which
was the main marketplace in Europe dealing with slaves.

By the 12th century the city was an important port, with a mixed Basque and
Gascon population. As part of Aquitaine, it was ruled by England between 1151 to
1452 and was a key commercial centre at the southern end of the English kingdom.

Its importance waned somewhat when the French king, Charles VII, took the city
at the end of the Hundred Years  War and the Adour changed course shortly
afterwards, leaving Bayonne without its access to the sea. The French, however,
realised Bayonne s strategic site near the Spanish border and in 1578 dug a
canal to redirect the river through the city once again.

Bayonne endured numerous sieges from Plantagenet times until the end of the
First French Empire in 1814. In the 17th century, Vauban built large
fortifications and the Citadelle in and around the city. These proved crucial in
1813 and 1814, when Wellington s army besieged the city in the Napoleonic Wars,
only taking it when they used a bridge of ships across the Adour to position
artillery around the city.

Bayonne s location close to the border, but also within the Basque Country
straddling both France and Spain, gave it an often privileged position in
commerce. Basque sailors travelled the world, bringing back products such as
cinnamon and riches from piracy and the whaling and cod trades. An armaments
industry developed, giving the world the  bayonet . Jewish refugees from the
Spanish Inquisition from 1560 brought new trades, most notably chocolate making,
which is still important in Bayonne. Spanish Basques also sought refuge in
Bayonne in the 20th century during Francisco Franco s repression, with Petit
Bayonne still a centre of Basque nationalism.

By the mid 19th century, Bayonne had declined somewhat with the centralisation
of power to Paris and to the new [[D  partements of France/d  partement]]
capital, non Basque Pau, after the 1789 French Revolution, and with Wellington s
bombardment. However, rail links with Paris from 1854 and the growing touristic
importance of nearby Biarritz brought industrialisation and development. Bayonne
is now part of  BAB   Bayonne Anglet Biarritz , a metropolitan area of almost
200,000 people.

Description

The Nive divides Bayonne into Grand Bayonne and Petit Bayonne, with five bridges
between the two, both quarters still backed by Vauban s walls. Indeed the Nive
is more like a main street, with many restaurants, squares and the covered
market on its quays. The houses lining the Nive are picturesque examples of
Basque architecture, with half timbering and shutters in the national colours of
red and green. The much wider Adour is to the north. The Pont St Esprit connects
Petit Bayonne with the Quartier St Esprit across the Adour, where the massive
Citadelle and the railway station are located.

Grand Bayonne is the commercial and civic hub, with small pedestrianised streets
packed with shops, plus the cathedral and H  tel de Ville. The Cath  drale Ste 
Mudle is an imposing, elegant Gothic building, rising over the houses, glimpsed
along the narrow streets. It was constructed in the 12th and 13th centuries. The
south tower was completed in the 16th century but the cathedral was only
completed in the 19th century with the north tower. The cathedral is noted for
its charming cloisters. There are other details and sculptures of note, although
much was destroyed in the Revolution. Nearby is the Ch  teau Vieux, some of
which dates back to the 12th century, where the governors of the city were
based, including the English Black Prince.
