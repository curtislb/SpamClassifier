Dear valued member!
This letter is a piece of advice by IPN (Internet Pharmacy Network) – officially registered organization dealing with the problem of mass drug falsification.
There are so many online drugstores on the Web today – but not all of them are as reliable as one might want them to be. Actually, only a few of them (for example, USDrugs) sell 100% generic meds – so you have to be really careful while choosing where to buy your pills.
Hope that you take our advice seriously. Take care.Please click here for more information.
With Best Regards,  Alison Hudson
USDrugs B.V.
