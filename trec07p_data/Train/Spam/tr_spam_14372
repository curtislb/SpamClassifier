Dear customer.It's not a secret that there are lots of online pharmacies that cheat their clients by selling fake drugs in order to make extra profits. We don't. "High price proves the high quality of the drug" That's what all Web pharmacies say in their ads. All except CanadianPharmacy. Drug sales tax is much lower here in Canada so we don't have any trouble dumping our rivals into tears. CanadianPharmacy generic quality CAN be cheap.CanadianPharmacy your #1 source for cheap generic drugs from Canada.Yours,Casandra Wilder
