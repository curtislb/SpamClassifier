Dear Prof.Dr.Tudhope,

Ten Days until the deadline for papers' submission.
As you know, we had sent you an email last week
calling you to participate in the 11th anniversary of the WSEAS during
the multiconference CSCC (Circuits - Systems - Communications -
Computers) in Crete island of Greece. Last year the event attracted
the interest of 1302 researchers, many of them from top, leading
universities.
See directly:    http://wseas.org/conferences/2007/greece

Last year, we received 1302 papers and from them only 600 papers were 
accepted. See the entire list of the reviewers (more than 2000) on the
web site of the WSEAS.  We had  also totally 60 special sessions, 15
Plenary Lectures, 2 Banquets, 1 Welcome Cocktail, 1 Excursion, 12
Coffee-Breaks. See please: http://worldses.org/reports/10th/

Upload your paper, now, until April 30 (no other extension will be
given). You can see my attached file at: www.wseas.org/cscc.doc
See below the Invited Plenary Speakers or on the web with many details
for their lectures.

New Important features of the CSCC (11th WSEAS Anniversary):
-------------------------------------------------------
1) A very strong and important feature is that the WSEAS is going to
give you a new username and password WITHOUT EXPIRY DATE for on-line
access in the WSEAS Conference proceedings FOR EVER.

2) WSEAS has also arranged collaboration with Hindawi Publishing Corp
http://www.hindawi.com and Springer Verlag, so, several papers will
appear in Volumes of Hindawi Publishing and Springer Verlag. The
authors can select between WSEAS Journals, Springer Verlag Volumes and
Hindawi Publishing Company, however, this requires presentation of
your paper in the conference, submission of extended version after the
conference and additional review and revision.

3) Publication of the Proceedings in 3 media: hard-copy, CD, E-Library
-------------------------------------------------------------------
(3.1) Hard-Copy Proceedings (Book) with ISBN and ISSN indexed by the
major Citation Indexes: www.worldses.org/indexes
(3.2) CD-ROM Proceedings with pages' numbers with ISBN and ISSN
    indexed  by the major Citation Indexes: www.worldses.org/indexes
(3.3) E-Library:  http://www.wseas.org/online

and possible:
  (3.4) JOURNAL PUBLICATION: Authors of high - quality papers of
archival value will be invited to send extended versions of their
papers to the international WSEAS Journals after the conference.
Necessary Condition is the presentation of the paper in the congress
