 Rock climbing , broadly speaking, is the act of ascending steep rock
formations. Normally, climbers use gear and safety equipment specifically
designed for the purpose. Strength, endurance, and mental control are required
to cope with tough, dangerous physical challenges, and knowledge of climbing
techniques and the use of essential pieces of gear and equipment are crucial.
Although rock climbing is an outdoor activity many cities are home to indoor
rock climbing gyms which can be formatted to match the physical  but not
necessarily mental or technical  skill level needed for outdoor climbing.

History



Although the practice of rock climbing was an important component of Victorian
mountaineering in the Alps, it is generally thought that the sport of rock
climbing began in the last quarter of the nineteenth century in at least three
areas  Elbsandsteingebirge, in Saxony near Dresden  ref name Saxony Goldammer,
Albert   W  chtler, Martin  1936 .  Bergsteigen in Sachsen , Dresden  ref , the
Lake District of England  ref name England Jones, Owen Glynne  1900 .  Rock
Climbing in the English Lake District , G. P. Abraham   Sons, Keswick  ref , and
the Dolomites in Italy  ref name Berg  Bergakrobaten  Die Dolomiten und die
Erfindung des Kletterns , Citt   di Bolzano, Bolzano 2006  ref . Rock climbing
evolved gradually from an alpine necessity to an athletic sport in its own
right, making it imprudent to cite a primogenitor of the latter in each of these
three locales. Nevertheless, there is some general agreement on the following 

 Heralded as a sport in England in the late 1880s after the  well publicised 
solo first ascent of the   Napes Needle   by Walter Parry Haskett Smith, rock
climbing attracted increasing numbers of participants. An early benchmark
approaching modern levels of difficulty was the ascent, by O. G. Jones, of
  Kern Knotts Crack    5.8  in 1897. Jones was attracted to the new sport by a
photo of the Needle in a shop window in the early 1890s. By the end of the
Victorian era as many as 60 enthusiasts at a time would gather at the Wastwater
Hotel in the Lake District during vacation periods  ref name Tigers Hankinson,
Alan  1972 .  The First Tigers , J. M. Dent   Sons, London  ref .

 Inspired by the efforts of late 19th century pioneers such as Oskar Schuster
 Falkenstein, Schusterweg 1892 , by 1903 there were approximately 500 climbers
active in the Elbsandstein region, including the well known team of Rudolf
Fehrmann and the American, Oliver Perry Smith  their 1906 ascent of Teufelsturm
 at VIIb  set new standards of difficulty. By the 1930s there were over 200
small climbing clubs represented in the area  ref name Saxony Goldammer, Albert
  W  chtler, Martin  1936 .  Bergsteigen in Sachsen , Dresden  ref .

 The solo first ascent of Die Vajolett  rme in 1887 by the 17 year old Munich
high school student, Georg Winkler, encouraged the acceptance and development of
the sport in the Dolomites ref name Berg  Bergakrobaten  Die Dolomiten und die
Erfindung des Kletterns , Citt   di Bolzano, Bolzano 2006  ref .

As rock climbing matured, a variety of grading systems were created in order to
more accurately compare relative difficulties of climbs. Over the years both
climbing techniques and the equipment climbers use to advance the sport have
evolved in a steady fashion. Many participants regard rock climbing as more a
lifestyle than merely an athletic pursuit.

Rock climbing basics

Climbers usually work in pairs, with one climbing and the other belaying. The
belayer feeds rope to the lead climber through a belay device. The leader climbs
up, places protection, climbs higher and places protection until the top is
reached. The belayer is ready to  lock off  the rope if the leader falls.

Both climbers attach the rope to their climbing harness, usually tying into
their harness with a figure eight knot or double bowline knot. The leader either
places protection or clips into permanent protection already secured to the
rock. In traditional climbing, the protection is removable. Usually nuts or Spring 
loaded camming device are set in cracks in the rock  although pitons are
sometimes used . In sport climbing the protection is metal loops called hangers.
Hangers are secured to the rock with either expanding masonry bolts taken from
the construction industry, or by placing glue in bolt systems. In ice climbing
the protection is Ice Screw or similar devices hammered or screwed into the ice
by the leader, and removed by the second climber.

The lead climber typically connects the rope to the protection with carabiners.
If the lead climber falls, he will fall twice the length of the rope out from
the last protection point, plus rope stretch  typically 5  to 8  of the rope
out , plus slack. If any of the gear breaks or pulls out of the rock or if the
belayer fails to lock off the belay device immediately, the fall will be
significantly longer. Thus if a climber is 2 meters above the last protection he
will fall 2 meters to the protection, 2 meters below the protection, plus slack
and rope stretch, for a total fall of over 4 meters.

If the leader falls, the belayer arrests the rope. This is achieved by running
the rope through a belay device attached to the belayer s harness. The belay
device runs the rope through a series of sharp curves that, when operated
properly, greatly increase the friction and stop the rope from running. Some of
the more popular types of belay devices are the ATC Belay Device, the Figure 8
and various auto locking belay devices such as the Petzl Gri Gri

At the top of the pitch, the leader sets up a secure anchor system, also called
a belay, from where he can belay as his partner climbs. The second climber
removes the gear from the rock  traditional climbing  or removes the carabiner
from the bolted hanger  sport climbing . Both climbers are now at the top of the
pitch with all their equipment. Note that the second is protected from above
while climbing, but the leader is not, so being the leader is more challenging
and dangerous.

Occasionally, climbers may decide to  move together , a risky but speedy
technique also called simul climbing, in which both leader and second move at
the same time without stopping to belay. The leader   approximately a rope
length above the second   usually places multiple pieces of protectio</STYLE>
