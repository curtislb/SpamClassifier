The  Common Raven   Corvus corax , also known as the  Northern Raven , is a
large all black passerine bird in the crow family, with iridescent feathers.
Found across the northern hemisphere, it is the most widespread occurring of all
corvids, ref name  Helm   Helm Identification Guides, Crows and Jays by Steve
Madge and Hilary Burn ISBN 0 7136 3999 7   ref  although recent molecular
studies may require a split into two or more species. ref name    Feld05    ref
name     Bakom06    Adaptable and intelligent, it has been able to coexist with
humans for thousands of years. Part of its success comes from its omnivorous
diet, as ravens are extremely versatile and opportunistic in where they get
their nutrition. Together with the Thick billed Raven, it is the largest corvid
and possibly the heaviest passerine bird.

Though the name  raven  has been applied to several other species of the genus
[[Crow/Corvus]], the term originally referred to this species. The word itself
is similar in many old Germanic languages  the Old English word for a raven was
hr  fn  in Old Norse it was hrafn and Old High German  h raban. ref Simpson J,
Weiner E. eds   1989  Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd edition, Clarendon Press,
ISBN 0 19 861186 2  ref  It is a bird which has been revered and worshipped in
cultures as diverse as Norse and Native American, and the subject of art,
literature, folklore and symbolism over the centuries. An old Scottish word
corby or corbie, akin to the French corbeau, has been used for both this bird
and the Carrion Crow. ref name    CotW83     ref  The specific epithet
corax            is the Greek word for raven. ref    ref 

Description At maturity, the Raven is between 56 to 69 nbsp cm  22 to
27 nbsp inches  in length, with a wingspan of 115 130 cm  45 51 inches .
Recorded weights range from 689 to 1625 g  ref name  Boarman   Heinrich  
Boarman, W. I. and Heinrich, B.  1999 . Common Raven     Corvus corax. Birds of
North America  476   1 32   ref , making it one of the heaviest passerines. It
has a longish, strongly graduated tail, mostly black plumage and a dark brown
iris. The throat feathers are elongated and pointed and the bases of the neck
feathers are pale brownish grey. The bill is large and slightly curved.

Apart from its greater size, the Raven differs from its cousins the crows by
having a larger and heavier beak and wedge shaped tail. ref name  
 observerbook    The species has a distinctive, deep, hollow pruk pruk pruk
call, unlike any other corvid call when known. The species has a very wide and
complex vocabulary, includes a high, knocking toc toc toc, a dry, grating kraa,
a low guttural rattle and some calls almost of a musical nature.  ref name
