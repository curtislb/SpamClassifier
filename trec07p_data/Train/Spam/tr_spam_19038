have that on the news today. Howard said he thinks that Fred could

She said Beth was telling her about how the whole chess thing had been
taking over his life like nothing before. Artie said Jon Stewart had a
lot of nice things to say about the show when he saw him down there.
Lisa said she lost 40 pounds and got a new coat and all of a sudden
she's gotten a make over.
Artie said he likes to hear that over him watching Dawson's Creek or
something like that.
