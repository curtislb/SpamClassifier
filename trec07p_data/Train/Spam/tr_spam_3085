in area, making it the largest island of the Baltic sea, though less than one
percent of Sweden s total land area. The region also includes the small islands
of F  r   and Gotska Sand  n to the north, and the tiny Karls   Islands to the
west. Inhabitants of the island number 57,600  2004 figure , with about 22,600
living in the primary city Visby. The main sources of income to the island are
tourism and agriculture.

The region is considered by some historians to be, or be part of, the original
homeland of the Goths. ref See Goths and Scandza for more information on this
matter.  ref 

Geography


The island province of Gotland is represented by the current administrative
entity, Gotland County. This county consists of the sole municipality  kommun 
Gotland Municipality.

Visby, with about two fifths of the island s population  circa 22,600 , is the
seat of the county council and municipal council.

Gotland is located about 90 km east off the Swedish mainland and about 130 km
from the Baltic States. The island Gotland is obviously just one island, but the
historical province of Gotland also includes adjacent islands, which are often
considered part of the Gotlandic culture 

 F  r  
  The Karls   Islands  Stora Karls   and Lilla Karls     Gotska Sand  n, a
  National park of Sweden.

Geology Gotland is made up of sedimentary rocks, most of it limestone, but in
the south also sandstone. The lime rocks have been weathered into characteristic
rock formations known as rauks.

History


The island is the home of the Gutar  the Gotlanders  and sites such as Ajvide
show that it has been occupied since prehistory. Early on Gotland became a
commercial center and the town of Visby was the most important Hanseatic city in
the Baltic Sea. The island had in late medieval time twenty district courts
 tings , each represented at the island ting, called landsting, by its elected
judge. New laws were decided at the landsting, which also took other decisions
regarding the island as a whole.

The [[Gutasaga]] contains legends of how the island was settled by   ieluar and
populated by his descendants. It also tells that a third of the population had
to emigrate and settle in southern Europe, a tradition associated with the
migration of the Goths, whose name has the same origin as [[Gutar]], the native
name of the people of the island. It later tells that the Gotlanders voluntarily
submitted to the king of Sweden and asserts that it is based on mutual
agreements, and notes the duties and obligations of the Swedish King and Bishop
in relationship to Gotland. It is therefore not only an effort to write down the
history of Gotland, but also an effort to assert Gotlands independence from
Sweden.

It gives Awair Strabain as the man who arranged the mutually beneficial
agreement with the king of Sweden, and the event would have taken place before
the end of the 9th century, when Wulfstan of Hedeby reported that the island was
subject to the Swedes 

 Then, after the land of the Burgundians, we had on our left the lands that have
been called from the earliest times Blekingey, and Meore, and Eowland, and
Gotland, all which territory is subject to the Sweons  and Weonodland was all
the way on our right, as far as Weissel mouth.

The city of Visby and rest of the island were governed separately and a civil
war caused by conflicts between the German merchants in Visby and the trading
peasants on the countryside had to be put down by King Magnus III of Sweden in
1288. In 1361, Waldemar Atterdag of Denmark invaded the island. The Victual
Brothers occupied the island in 1394 to set up a stronghold headquarters on
their own in Visby. At last Gotland came as a fiefdom of the Teutonic Knights,
awarded to them on the condition that they expel the piratical Victual Brothers
from their fortified sanctuary. An invasion army of Teutonic Knights conquered
the island in 1398, destroying Visby and driving the Victual Brothers from
Gotland.

The number of Arab dirhams discovered on the island of Gotland alone is
astoundingly high. In the various hoards located around the island, there are
more of these silver coins than any other site in Western Eurasia. The total sum
is almost as great as the number that has been unearthed in the entire Muslim
world. These coins moved North through trade between Rus merchants and the
Abbasid Caliphate, along the Silver Fur Road, and the money made by Scandinavian
merchants would help Northern Europe, especially Viking Scandinavia and the
Carolingian Empire, as major commercial centers for the next several centuries.

The authority of the landsting was successively eroded after the island was
occupied by the Teutonic Order, then sold to Eric of Pomerania and after 1449
ruled by Danish governors. In late medieval times, the ting consisted of twelve
representatives for the farmers, free holders or tenants. Since the Treaty of
Br  msebro in 1645, the has island remained under Swedish rule.

Heraldry Gotland was granted its arms in about 1560, even though the island was
at the time occupied by Danish forces. The coat of arms is represented with a
ducal coronet. Blazon   Azure a ram statant Argent armed Or holding on a cross 
staff of the same a banner Gules bordered and with five tails of the third. 

The Gotlandic flag displays the Gotlandic national coat of arms, white on red
ground, known from the 13th century in the shape of the seal of the Gotlandic
Republic with the proud ram. It reads   Gutenses signo xpistus signatur in
agno . This can be translated as follows   I  the ram  am the sign of the
Gotlanders, but with the lamb symbolize Christ .

Culture


The medieval town of Visby has been entered as a site of the UNESCO World
heritage program. An impressive feature of Visby is the fortress wall that
surrounds the old city, dating from the time of the Hanseatic League.

The inhabitants of Gotland traditionally spoke their own language, known as
Gutnish. Today however, they have adapted a dialect of Swed</STYLE>
