The  Turkey Vulture   Cathartes aura  is the most common vulture in the
Americas. Despite the similarity in name and appearance, this species is
unrelated to the Old World vultures of the family Accipitridae, which also
includes eagles, hawks, kites and harriers. The American species are New World
vultures in the family Cathartidae.

These birds are now placed in the order Ciconiiformes near the storks, but the
taxonomy of the New World vultures is not settled. Undoubtedly, though, New
World vultures are not very closely related to Old World vultures. The
similarities are due to convergent evolution.

This bird got its common name by the resemblance of the adult s bald red head
 and possibly its dark plumage  to that of the male Wild Turkey.

Description The typical adult bird is an average 76 cm  30   long with a 185 cm
 6 ft  wingspan, and weighing 1.4 kg  3.1 lb . The sexes are similar, with the
female being slightly larger. Their body feathers are mostly brownish black, but
the flight feathers on the wings appear silvery gray beneath, contrasting with
the darker wing linings. The adult head is small in proportion to its body, red
in color with few to no feathers, and has a relatively short, hooked, ivory 
colored bill. The immature bird has a gray head with a black beak tip.

Flight



While soaring, they hold their wings in a V shape and often tip  drunkenly  from
side to side, frequently causing the gray flight feathers to appear silvery as
they catch the light. They flap their wings very infrequently, often taking
advantage of rising thermals to keep them soaring. The distinctive flight style,
small headed and narrow winged silhouette, and underwing pattern make this bird
easy to identify at great distances.

These birds soar over open areas, watching for dead animals or for other
scavengers at work. Unlike most birds, the Turkey Vulture often uses its sense
of smell to locate food. It will often fly low to the ground to pick up the
scent of ethyl mercaptan, a gas produced by the beginnings of decay in dead
animals. The olfactory lobe of its brain responsible for processing smells is
particularly large compared to other animals. This heightened ability to detect
odors allows it to search for carrion below the forest canopy.

Voice

Turkey vultures, like most other vultures, have very few vocalization
capabilities. With no vocal organ, they can only utter hisses and
grunts. ref   cite journal

Diet

Feeds primarily on a wide variety of carrion, from small mammals to large
grazers, preferring those recently dead, but may also feed on plant matter,
shoreline vegetation, pumpkin and other crops, live insects and other
invertebrates. They prefer the meat of herbivorous animals to that of dogs and
other carnivores. Turkey Vultures can often be seen along roadsides cleaning up
roadkill, or near rivers feasting on washed up fish, another of their favorite
foods.

Habitat


The Turkey Vulture is found in open and semi open areas throughout the Americas
from southern Canada to Cape Horn. It is a permanent resident in the southern
United States but northern birds may migrate as far south as South America.

The nesting site is in a protected location  on a cliff, directly on ground in
caves, crevices, mammal burrows, inside a hollow tree, in a thicket, or in
abandoned buildings. There is little or no construction of a nest. Females lay
two eggs, cream colored, with brown spots around their larger end. Both parents
incubate, and the young hatch at around 40 days. The adults regurgitate food for
them and care for them for 10 to 11 weeks. If the young are approached in the
nest, they defend themselves by hissing and regurgitating. The age of the young
at first flight is about 9 10 weeks.

Often, small to large groups of these birds spend the night at communal roosts,
and favored locations may be reused for many years.

Range

 Summer Range 

Breeds from southern Canada throughout the United States and southward through
southern South America and the Caribbean. Local or absent on the Great Plains.

 Winter Range 

Winters from northern California, the Mexican border, eastern Texas, southern
Missouri, and southern New York southward throughout the southeastern United
States.

Behavior

Turkey Vultures are gentle and non aggressive. They may roost in large community
groups, breaking away to forage independently during the day.

Turkey Vultures are often seen standing in a spread winged stance. This is
called the  horaltic pose.  The stance is believed to serve multiple functions 
drying the wings, warming the body, and baking off bacteria.

The Turkey Vulture has few natural predators. Its primary form of defense is
vomiting. These birds do not  projectile vomit,  as many would claim. They
simply cough up a lump of semi digested meat. This foul smelling substance
deters most creatures intent on raiding a vulture nest. It will also sting if
the offending animal is close enough to get the vomit in its face or eyes.

In some cases, the vulture must rid its crop of a heavy, undigested meal in
order to lift off and flee from a potential predator. In this case, the
regurgitated material has not yet been digested. Most predators will give up
pursuit of the vulture in favor of this free edible offering.

Like storks, the Turkey Vulture often defecates on its own legs, using the
evaporation of the water in the feces and or urine to cool itself down, a
process known as urohydrosis. ref   ref  Also, due to the nature of their diets,
vulture excreta has a high ur</STYLE>
