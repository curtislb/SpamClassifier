 Babylon   in Arabic            in Syriac           in Hebrew         was an
ancient city in Mesopotamia  modern Al Hillah, Iraq , the ruins of which can be
found in present day Babil Province, about 50 miles  80 nbsp km  south of
Baghdad. The form Babylon is the Greek variant of Akkadian  Babilu   b  b 
[[ilah/il  ]], meaning  Gateway of the god s  , translating Sumerian
 KA2.DINGIR.RA  . It was the  holy city  of Babylonia from around 2300 BC, and
the seat of the Neo Babylonian Empire from 612 BC. In the Bible, the name
appears as         [[Babel]] , interpreted by Genesis 11 9 to mean  confusion ,
from the verb balal,  to confuse .

The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient
World.

History The earliest mention of Babylon is in a dated tablet of the reign of
Sargon of Akkad  24th century BC short chr. . Over the years, its power and
population waned. From around the 20th century BC, it was occupied by Amorites
 nomadic Semitic tribes , fleeing southern Mesopotamia from the west. The First
Babylonian Dynasty was established by Sumu abum, but the city state controlled
little surrounding territory until it became the capital of Hammurabi s empire.
Hammurabi is known for codifying the laws of Babylonia, that were to have a
profound influence on the region.  ca. 18th century BC . From that time onward,
it continued to be the capital of Babylonia, although during the 440 years of
domination by the Kassites  1595   1185 BC , the city was renamed
 Karanduniash .

The city itself was built upon the Euphrates, and divided in equal parts along
its left and right banks, with steep embankments to contain the river s seasonal
floods. Babylon grew in extent and grandeur over time, but gradually became
subject to the rule of Assyria.

It has been estimated that Babylon was the largest city in the world from c.
1770 to 1670 BC, and again between c. 612 and 320 BC. It was perhaps the first
city to reach a population above 200,000.

Assyrian period

During the reign of Sennacherib of Assyria, Babylonia was in a constant state of
revolt, led by Mushezib Marduk, and suppressed only by the complete destruction
of the city of Babylon. In 689 BC, its walls, temples and palaces were razed,
and the rubble was thrown into the Arakhtu, the canal bordering the earlier
Babylon on the south. This act shocked the religious conscience of Mesopotamia 
the subsequent murder of Sennacherib was held to be in expiation of it, and his
successor Esarhaddon hastened to rebuild the old city, to receive there his
crown, and make it his residence during part of the year. On his death,
Babylonia was left to be governed by his elder son Shamash shum ukin, who
eventually headed a revolt in 652 BC against his brother in Nineveh,
Assurbanipal.

The city of Babylon was reputedly surrounded by a wall 300 feet  91 nbsp m 
high, 80 feet  24 nbsp m  wide, and 60 miles  97 nbsp km  in circumference. The
wall was also buried 35 feet  10.7 nbsp m  into the soil in order to prevent
enemies from burrowing into the city limits.

Once again, Babylon was besieged by the Assyrians and starved into surrender.
Assurbanipal purified the city and celebrated a  service of reconciliation , but
did not venture to  take the hands  of Bel. In the subsequent overthrow of the
Assyrian Empire, the Babylonians saw another example of divine vengeance.

Neo Babylonian Empire



Under Nabopolassar, Babylon threw off the Assyrian rule in 626 BC, and became
the capital of the Neo Babylonian Empire.

With the recovery of Babylonian independence, a new era of architectural
activity ensued, and his son Nebuchadnezzar II  605 BC   562 BC  made Babylon
into one of the wonders of the ancient world. Nebuchadnezzar ordered the
complete reconstruction of the imperial grounds, including rebuilding the
Etemenanki ziggurat and the construction of the Ishtar Gate     the most
spectacular of eight gates that ringed the perimeter of Babylon. The Ishtar Gate
survives today in the Pergamon Museum in Berlin. Nebuchadnezzar is also credited
with the construction of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon  one of the seven
wonders of the ancient world , said to have been built for his homesick wife
Amyitis. Whether the gardens did exist is a matter of dispute. Although
excavations by German archaeologist Robert Koldewey are thought to reveal its
foundations, many historians disagree about the location, and some believe it
may have been confused with gardens in Nineveh.

Babylon under Persia In 539 BC the Neo Babylonian Empire fell to Cyrus the
Great, king of Persia. It is said that Cyrus walked throug</STYLE>
