 All Quiet on the Western Front  is a novel by Erich Maria Remarque, a German
veteran of World War I, about the horrors of that war and also the deep
detachment from German civilian life felt by many men returning from the front.
The book was first published in German as  Im Westen nichts Neues  in January
1929. It sold 2.5 million copies in twenty five languages in its first eighteen
months in print. In 1930 the book was turned into an Oscar winning movie of the
same name, directed by Lewis Milestone.

Title and translation The 1929 English translation by Arthur Wesley Wheen gives
the title as All Quiet on the Western Front. The literal translation is in fact
 Nothing New in the West   Im Westen Nichts Neues , with  West  being the war
front, which was in fact a routine dispatch used by the German Army. This title
in German adds to the terrible irony of the actual situation. In English the
phrase would be unclear, whereas  All Quiet...  does sound like the English used
for such matters.

Brian Murdoch s 1994 translation renders the phrase as  there was nothing new to
report on the western front  within the narrative. Explaining his retention of
the original book title, he says 

 Although it does not match the German exactly  there is a different kind of
irony in the literal version... , Wheen s title has justly become part of the
English language and is retained here with gratitude.

Separately, the phrase  all quiet on the western front  later became popular
slang for a lack of action  in reference to the Phony War in World War II s
Western Front .

Plot summary

The story follows the experiences of Paul B  umer  a soldier whose teacher
inspires him to join the German army shortly after the start of the war. He
arrives on the Western Front with his friends  Tjaden, M  ller, Kropp and a
number of other characters  and meets Stanislaus Katczinsky, known as Kat. The
older Kat soon becomes Paul s mentor and teaches him about the realities of war.
Paul and Kat swiftly become almost brothers, bonded by the hardships of the war.

Paul and his friends have to endure day after day of non stop bombardment.
Eventually it all becomes clear to him  war is entirely pointless. All his
friends say that they are fighting the war for a few national leaders whom they
have never met and most likely never will. They are the only people that can
gain anything from this war, not Paul and his friends.

The book does not focus not on heroic stories of bravery as do so many other war
stories, but rather gives a realistic view of the hell in which the soldiers
found themselves. The monotony, the constant artillery fire, the struggle to
find food, and the overarching role of chance in the lives and deaths of the
soldiers, are all described in detail. Unlike many other war novels, here
individual battles have no names and are of little significance. Rather, one
after another each battle offers a new chance for Paul and his comrades to be
killed. The armies fight battles to gain pitifully small pieces of land, only to
lose them again later. Remarque often refers to the living soldiers as old and
dead, emotionally depleted and hardened.  We are not youth any longer. We don t
want to take the world by storm. We are fleeing from ourselves, from our life.
We were eighteen and had begun to love life and the world  and we had to shoot
it to pieces. 

Paul s visit on leave to his home highlights the cost of the war on his psyche.
The town was hit by artillery but has not changed since he went off to war, but
he finds that he does  not belong here anymore, it is a foreign world.  He feels
disconnected from most of the townspeople. His father asks him  stupid and
awesome  questions about his war experiences, not understanding  that a man
cannot talk of such things.  An old schoolmaster lectures him about strategy and
marching on Paris, while insisting that Paul and his friends know only their
 own little sector  of the war but nothing of the big picture. Indeed, the only
person he remains connected to is his dying mother, with whom he shares a tender
yet restrained relationship. The night before he is to return from leave, he
stays up with her exchanging small expressions of love and concern for each
other. He thinks to himself,  Ah  Mother, Mother  how can it be that I must part
from you? Here I sit and there you are lying  we have so much to say, and we
shall never say it.  In the end, he concludes that he  ought never to have come
[home] on leave. 

Main Characters Paul B  umer

Paul B  umer is the narrator. He is convinced to enlist in the German Army for
WWI by his schoolmaster, Kantorek. He s 19 years old when he goes to war.

Erich Remarque uses Paul to magnify some of the experiences he viewed himself as
a WW I veteran.

He is kind hearted and always willing to lend a hand.

His deeds include  giving his remaining cigarettes to Russian prisoners and
replacing the new recruits saw blade bayonets with normal bayonets, catching a
goose to cook with Kat in an intimate lean to, visiting his dying mother, and
trying to save a French soldier in a shell hole after stabbing him to save his
own life.

Along with others of his group, he teaches the basics of war to the new
recruits, but in their excitement, they do everything wrong.

In the film adaptations, he was shown killed whilst reaching for a butterfly
 film  or drawing a bird  television movie .

Paul is also used to describe the highly heightened sense of war, and the
remorse when killing the French soldier mentioned above. He goes through the
man s pockets, learns about his life and family and  briefly  dedicates himself
to their welfare.

The day on which Paul is finally killed was otherwise militarily uneventful,
with the German army dispatches merely noting Im Westen nichts Neues, which, as
noted above, translates literally to Nothing new in the West. This brings home
that Paul s death   being only one among millions   is nothing special.
