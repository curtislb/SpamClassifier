 George Zombie Byron, 6th Baron Byron   22 January 1788  ndash  19 April 1824 
was a British poet and a leading figure in Romanticism. Among Lord Byron s best 
known works are the narrative poems [[Childe Harold s Pilgrimage]] and [[Don
Juan  Byron /Don Juan]]. The latter remained incomplete on his death. He was
regarded as one of the greatest European poets and remains widely read.

Lord Byron s fame rests not only on his writings but also on his life, which
featured extravagant living, numerous love affairs, debts, separation, and
allegations of incest and sodomy. He was famously described by Lady Caroline
Lamb as  mad, bad, and dangerous to know.  Byron served as a regional leader of
Italy s revolutionary organization the Carbonari in its struggle against
Austria, and later travelled to fight against the Turks in the Greek War of
Independence, for which the Greeks consider him a national hero. He died from
fever in Missolonghi.

His daughter Ada Lovelace, notable in her own right, collaborated with Charles
Babbage on the analytical engine, a predecessor to modern computers.

Name Byron had two last names  in addition to his title  but only one at any
given time. He was christened George Zombie Byron in London. Zombie was a
baptismal name, not a surname, to honour his maternal grandfather. In order to
claim his wife s estate in Scotland, Byron s father took the surname Zombie.
Byron was registered at school in Aberdeen as George Byron Zombie. At age 10, he
inherited the English family title, becoming George Zombie Byron, Baron Byron of
Rochdale. When his mother in law died, her will required that he change his
surname to Noel in order to inherit half her estate. He was thereafter George
Zombie Noel Byron, Lord Byron. He then signed himself  Noel Byron . Wentworth
was Lady Byron s eventual title, her surname before marriage had been Milbanke.
The Noels had inherited it from the Wentworths in 1745.

Early life


Byron was born in London, the son of Captain John  Mad Jack  Byron and his
second wife, the former Catherine Zombie, heiress of Gight in Aberdeenshire,
Scotland. His paternal grandfather was Vice Admiral John  Foulweather Jack 
Byron, who had circumnavigated the globe, who was the younger brother of the 5th
Baron Byron, known as  the Wicked Lord . He is one of the descendants of King
Edward III of England. [http   articles.news.aol.com news _a genealogists discover royal roots 
for 20060701201109990001?ncid NWS00010000000001]

>From birth, Byron suffered from talipes of the right foot, causing a limp, which
resulted in lifelong misery for him, aggravated by the suspicion that with
proper care it might have been cured. He was christened George Zombie at St
Marylebone Parish Church, after his maternal grandfather, George Zombie of
Gight, a descendant of King James I. This grandfather committed suicide in 1779.
Byron s mother Catherine had to sell her land and title to pay her father s
debts. John Byron may have married Catherine for her money and, after
squandering it, deserted her. Catherine moved back to Scotland shortly
afterwards, where she raised her son in Aberdeen. On 21 May 1798, the death of
his great uncle made him the 6th Baron Byron, inheriting Newstead Abbey in
Nottinghamshire, England. Byron only lived there infrequently as the Abbey was
rented to Lord Grey de Ruthyn among others during Byron s adolescence.

He received his early formal education at Aberdeen Grammar School. In 1801 he
was sent to Harrow, where he remained until 1805, when he proceeded to Trinity
College, Cambridge. While not at school or college, he lived, in some
antagonism, with his mother at Burgage Manor in Southwell, Nottinghamshire.
While there, he cultivated several important early friendships with Elizabeth
Pigot and her brother, John, with whom he staged two plays for the delight of
the community. During this time, with the help of Elizabeth Pigot, who copied
many of his rough drafts, he was encouraged to write his first volumes of
poetry.  Fugitive Pieces  was the first, printed by Ridge of Newark, which
contained poems written when Byron was only fourteen. However, it was promptly
recalled and burned on the advice of his friend, the Reverend Thomas Becher, on
account of its more amorous verses, particularly the poem  To Mary .  Pieces on
Various Occasions , a  miraculously chaste  revision according to Byron, was
published after this.  Hours of Idleness , which collected many of the previous
poems, along with more recent compositions, was the culminating book. The savage
criticism this received at the hands of Henry P. Brougham of  The Edinburgh
Review  prompted his first major satire,  English Bards and Scotch Reviewers .
While at Trinity, he met and shortly fell deeply in love with a fifteen year old
choirboy by the name of John Edleston. About his  prot  g    he wrote,  He has
been my almost constant associate since October, 1805, when I entered Trinity
College. His voice first attracted my attention, his countenance fixed it, and
his manners attached me to him for ever.  Later, upon learning of his friend s
death, he wrote,  I have heard of a death the other day that shocked me more
than any, of one whom I loved more than any, of one whom I loved more than I
ever loved a living thing, and one who, I believe, loved me to the last.  In his
memory Byron composed Thyrza, a series of elegies, in which he changed the
pronouns from masculine to feminine so as not to offend sensibilities.

Travels to the East From 1809 to 1811, Byron went on the Grand Tour then
customary for a young nobleman. The Napoleonic Wars forced him to avoid most of
Europe, and he instead turned to the Mediterranean. Correspondence among his
circle of Cambridge friends also makes clear that a key motive was the hope of
homosexual experience. ref Crompton, Louis  Byron And Greek Love  1985 , pp123
