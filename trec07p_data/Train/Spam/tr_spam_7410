is the county seat of Stanislaus County in the U.S. state of California. As of
the 2000 census, the city population was 188,856. Current census estimates place
the population at 206,300. According to the California State Department of
Finance 1 6 06 estimate, 514,370 people live in the Modesto Metropolitan
Statistical Area. Roughly 110 miles from Yosemite National Park, 80 miles from
Sacramento, California s capital city, and about 90 miles from both San Jose and
San Francisco, Modesto is less than 2 hours from many prime locations in
California. This proximity to major business centers has turned the
agriculturally based city into a bedroom community. Over twenty percent of the
workforce travels outside of the county to their place of employment. The area
is plagued by some of the worst air quality in the nation, on occasion
surpassing even that of Los Angeles. It is also reported to have the highest car
theft per capita rate in the United States for at least two years.

Geography Modesto is located at  37.661479,  120.994543 . Modesto is located on
the Tuolumne River and is bordered by the Stanislaus and San Joaquin rivers.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 93.1
km    36.0 mi   . 92.7 km    35.8 mi    of it is land and 0.4 km    0.2 mi    of
it  0.47   is water.

Modesto s climate consists of hot, dry summers, cool to mild winters, and
temperate spring and fall seasons. Precipitation is greatest from November to
March  known as the Rainy Season , a period that is also characteristic of dense
tule fog. The all time record high temperature is 113  F  45  C  set recently on
July 23, 2006. The all time record low temperature is 18  F   8  C  set on
December 13, 1932.

Modesto s international character can also be seen in its five officially
recognized sister cities. They are Kurume, Japan  Vernon, Canada  Vijayawada,
India  Aquascalientes, Mexico  and Khmelnytskyi, Ukraine.

History

Modesto, originally a stop on the railroad connecting Sacramento to Los Angeles,
was founded in 1870 and was to be named for William Ralston, its founder and the
financier of many projects in early California. However, he declined the
suggestion and a Spanish speaking railroad worker at the naming ceremony said
that Ralston was  Muy modesto   very modest . Instead, the town was named
Modesto.

Modesto s official slogan is  Water Wealth Contentment Health,  which is
emblazoned on a large arch downtown that has been immortalized in many
photographs. A contest was run in 1911 to determine the slogan. The original
winning slogan was   Nobody s got Modesto s goat . The second place entry was
the final winner.    

Sights Modesto is commonly referred to as  a great place to live, a horrible
place to visit.  That said, there are quite a few sights to see.

 The McHenry Mansion was built by hand in the early 1880s by Robert McHenry, a
local rancher and banker. The mansion is included on the National Register of
Historic Places. Tours are given.

 The McHenry Museum, across the street from the McHenry Mansion, is filled with
tidbits from Modesto s history.

Transportation Modesto is served by one of the busiest rail corridors in the
country. The Amtrak [[San Joaquins]] make six daily stops on the route between
Oakland and Bakersfield, and two stops daily on the route between Sacramento and
Bakersfield.

Modesto is also served by California State Route 99, California State Route 132,
and California State Route 108, the latter a seasonal highway  opening usually
in May or June, closing with the first major snow  which is the main route into
Stanislaus National Forest and Inyo National Forest.

The Modesto City County Airport lies next to the Tuolumne River in the
southeastern end of the city. Air service is provided between it and San
Francisco International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport by Skywest
Airlines, operating as United Express under an agreement with United Airlines.

Three public transit systems serve Modesto  [http   www.modestoareaexpress.com

 StaRT ], and the San Joaquin Regional Transit District along the northern edge
of the city on McHenry Avenue. MAX is the local system with additional
