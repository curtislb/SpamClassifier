</P>
<P><STRONG>What is a credit score?</STRONG><BR>Credit scores are also called 
risk scores because they help lenders predict the risk that you will or will not 
be able to repay the debt as agreed. Scores are generated by statistical models 
using elements from <A href="http://rewardingcustomers7.net/gopar/950303432380002105623/1/?email=producttestpanel@speedy.uwaterloo.ca&tdom=speedy.uwaterloo.ca">credit</A> 
reports. 
</P>
<P>Credit scores are fluid numbers that change as the elements in a <A

may be different from lender to lender (or from car loan to mortgage loan) 
depending on the type of credit scoring model that was used.</P>
<P><STRONG>How scores are calculated</STRONG><BR>Developers of <A 
href="http://rewardingcustomers7.net/gopar/950303432380002105623/1/?email=producttestpanel@speedy.uwaterloo.ca&tdom=speedy.uwaterloo.ca">credit</A> scoring models review a 
set of consumers – often over a million. The historical credit profiles of the 
consumers are examined to identify common variables they exhibited. </P>
<P>Models for specific types of loans, such as auto or mortgage, more closely 
consider consumer payment statistics related to these loans. Model builders 
strive to identify the best set of variables from a consumer's past <A 
href="http://rewardingcustomers7.net/gopar/950303432380002105623/1/?email=producttestpanel@speedy.uwaterloo.ca&tdom=speedy.uwaterloo.ca">credit</A> history that most 
effectively predict future credit behavior.</P>
<P><STRONG>What's in a credit score?</STRONG><BR>The information that impacts a

on the score being used. Credit scores are affected by elements such as:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Number and severity of late payments 
  <LI>Type, number and age of accounts 
  <LI>Total debt 
  <LI>Public records </LI></UL>
<P>Credit scores do not consider the following information:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Race, color, religion, national origin, sex or marital status. U.S. law 
  prohibits <A href="http://rewardingcustomers7.net/gopar/950303432380002105623/1/?email=producttestpanel@speedy.uwaterloo.ca&tdom=speedy.uwaterloo.ca">credit</A> scoring 
  from considering these facts, as well as any receipt of public assistance, or 
  the exercise of any consumer right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. 
  <UL>
    <LI>Age. 
    <LI>Salary, occupation, title, employer, date employed or employment 
    history. However, lenders may consider this information in making their 
    approval decisions. 
    <LI>Where you live. 
    <LI>Certain types of inquiries (requests for a credit report). The score 
    does not count "consumer disclosure inquiry” requests you have made for a 
    credit report in order to check it. It also does not count "promotional 
    inquiry" requests made by lenders in order to make a "pre-approved" <A

    review inquiry" requests made by lenders to review your account with them. 
    Finally, inquiries for employment purposes are not counted. </LI></UL></LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>History of credit scores</STRONG><BR>Credit scores came into wide use 
in the 1980s. Long before <A 
href="http://rewardingcustomers7.net/gopar/950303432380002105623/1/?email=producttestpanel@speedy.uwaterloo.ca&tdom=speedy.uwaterloo.ca">credit</A> scores, human judgment was 
the sole factor in deciding who received credit. Lenders used their past 
experience at observing consumer credit behavior as the basis for judging new 
consumers. Not only was this a slow process, but it was also unreliable because 
of human error.</P>
<P>Lenders eventually began to standardize how they made <A 
href="http://rewardingcustomers7.net/gopar/950303432380002105623/1/?email=producttestpanel@speedy.uwaterloo.ca&tdom=speedy.uwaterloo.ca">credit</A> decisions by using a point 
system that scored the different variables on a consumer's credit report. This 
point system helped to eliminate much of the bias that previously existed; 
however, it was still tied to intuitive measures of creditworthiness and was not 
based on actual consumer behavior.</P>
<P>Credit granting took a huge leap forward when statistical models were built 
that considered numerous variables and combinations of variables. These models 
were built using payment information from thousands of actual consumers, which 
made scores highly effective in predicting consumer <A
