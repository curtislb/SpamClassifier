Hello, Patrick

Do you know what love is? I have heard a lot about it but have never
experienced a true one!!  I think that to talk about love is like to 
dance about literature – it is useless!! You have to live your love 
and feel it, you have to give it – isn’t it the real sense of  this life??
Do you believe that two  hearts can learn to beat as one?? Write to me 
at http://flirtwithmedirect.com/alone and we shall find it out!!

Looking forward to get a letter from you

Olechka
