As part of an insane marketing test, I''m giving away an
in-depth Internet "Business-In-A-Box". I should be selling
this for $497, but...I''m flat out giving it away. 

Your cost is zero... zip... zilch!

You probably think I''ve lost my mind - and maybe I have - 
but just visit this site right now and in 5 minutes you''ll
have this awesome $497 Internet business training kit
as my gift to you. No kidding!

Grab it quick - right now - before I change my mind...
