The  Ivory billed Woodpecker   Campephilus principalis  is a very large and
extremely rare member of the woodpecker family, Picidae  it is officially listed
as an endangered species, but by the end of the 20th century had widely been
considered extinct.

Reports of at least one male bird in Arkansas in 2004 and 2005 were suggested in
April 2005 by a team led by the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology  Fitzpatrick
et al., 2005 . If confirmed, this would make the Ivory billed Woodpecker a
lazarus species, a species that is rediscovered alive after being considered
extinct for some time.

In June 2006, a $10,000 reward was offered for information leading to the
discovery of an Ivory billed Woodpecker nest, roost or feeding site. ref   ref 

In late September 2006, a team of ornithologists from Auburn University and the
University of Windsor published a paper detailing suggestive evidence for the
existence of Ivory billed Woodpeckers along the Choctawhatchee River in
northwest Florida  Hill et al., 2006 .

This iconic bird, a symbol of lost southern bayous and swamps, is now a symbol
of hope for conservationists throughout the world. Efforts begun in the 1970s
preserved vital habitat for the species, allowing any remaining birds to
survive. Major land acquisition and restoration efforts are currently underway
to protect the possible survival of this woodpecker.

Description The Ivory billed Woodpecker is the largest woodpecker species in the
United States. The largest of all woodpeckers is the closely related Imperial
Woodpecker  C. imperialis  of western Mexico, another rare species which is very
likely to be extinct. The Ivory billed is 20 inches tall and weighs 20 ounces.
It has a 30 inch wing span.

The bird is shiny blue black with white markings on its neck and back and
extensive white on the trailing edge of both the upper  and underwing. The
underwing is also white along its forward edge, resulting in a black line
running along the middle of the underwing, expanding to more extensive black at
the wingtip. In adults, the bill is ivory in color, chalky white in juveniles.
Ivory bills have a prominent crest, although in juveniles it is ragged. The
crest is black in juveniles and females. In males, the crest is black along its
forward edge, changing abruptly to red on the side and rear. The chin of an ivory 
bill is black. When perched with the wings folded, ivory bills of both sexes
present a large patch of white on the lower back, roughly triangular in shape.
These characteristics distinguish it from the smaller and darker billed Pileated
Woodpecker. The Pileated normally is brownish black, smoky, or slaty black in
color. It also has a white neck stripe but the back is normally black. Pileated
juveniles and adults have a red crest and a white chin. Pileateds normally have
no white on the trailing edges of their wings and when perched normally show
only a small patch of white on each side of the body near the edge of the wing.
However, Pileated Woodpeckers, apparently aberrant individuals, have been
reported with white trailing edges on the wings, forming a white triangular
patch on the lower back when perched. Like all woodpeckers, the ivory bill has a
strong and straight bill and a long, mobile, hard tipped, barbed tongue. Among
North American woodpeckers, the ivory bill is unique in having a bill whose tip
is quite flattened laterally, shaped much like a beveled wood chisel. The bird s
drum is a single or double rap. Four fairly distinct calls are reported in the
literature and 2 were recorded in the 1930 s. The most common, a kent or hant,
sounds like a toy trumpet often repeated in series. When the bird is disturbed,
the pitch of the kent note rises, it is repeated more frequently, and is often
doubled. A conversational call, also recorded, is given between individuals at
the nest, and has been described as yent yent yent.

Habitat and diet Ivory billeds are known to prefer thick hardwood swamps and
pine forests, with large amounts of dead and decaying trees. Prior to the
American Civil War, much of the Southern United States was covered in vast
tracts of primeval hardwood forests that were suitable as habitat for the bird.</STYLE>
