Dear customer.CanadianPharmacy is one of very few online stores that sell generic medications only. Don't waste too much on what can cost less.Shopping for medications on the Web is really convenient but you should also pay a lot of attention to the quality and the price of product offered. At CanadianPharmacy you will always be able to find drugs of 100% generic quality. CanadianPharmacy we don't save on our clients.Don't look for prices lower than those at CanadianPharmacy anything that is cheaper is a fake.Best regards,Craig Staton
