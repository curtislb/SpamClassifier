The  Gray Wolf   Canis lupus  also spelled  Grey Wolf , see spelling
differences  also known as  Timber Wolf  or  Wolf   is a mammal in the order
Carnivora. The Gray Wolf shares a common ancestry with the domestic dog  Canis
lupus familiaris , as evidenced by DNA sequencing and genetic drift
studies. ref   ref  Gray wolves were once abundant and distributed over much of
North America, Eurasia, and the Middle East. Today, for a variety of human 
related reasons, including widespread habitat destruction and excessive hunting,
wolves inhabit only a very limited portion of their former range. Though listed
as a species of least concern for extinction worldwide, for some regions
including the Continental United States, the species is listed as endangered or
threatened. ref name  endangered    ref 

The Gray Wolf, being a keystone predator, is an important part of the ecosystems
to which it typically belongs. The wide range of habitats where wolves thrive
reflects their adaptability as a species, and includes temperate forests,
mountains, tundra, taiga, and grasslands. In much of the world, with the
exception of Northern regions, they are listed as endangered. They continue to
be hunted in many areas of the world for their perceived threat to livestock, as
well as for sport.

Anatomy, physiology, and reproduction

Features and adaptations The weight and size of the Gray Wolf can vary greatly
worldwide, and tend to increase proportionally with latitude. Generally
speaking, height varies from 0.6 ndash 0.9 meters  26 ndash 34 inches  at the
shoulder, and weight from 32 ndash 62 kilograms  70 ndash 135 pounds , which
together make Gray Wolves the largest of all wild canids. ref
name  sinapu    ref  Although rarely encountered, extreme specimens of more than
77 kg  170 lb  have been recorded in Alaska and Canada  ref
name  handbook    ref  the heaviest wild wolf on record, which was killed in
Alaska in 1939, was 80 kg  175 lb . ref name  CWC    ref  There are some
unconfirmed reports of wolves hunted in North Eastern Russia reaching weights of
100 kg.  220 lb . ref http   www.russianhunting.com wolf hunting in 
russia   ref  The smallest wolves come from the Arabian Wolf subspecies, the
females of which may weigh as little as 10 kg  22 lb  at maturity. Females in a
given population typically weigh about 20  less than their male
counterparts. ref   ref  Wolves can measure anywhere from 1.3 ndash 2 meters
 4.5 ndash 6.5 feet  from nose to the tip of the tail, which itself accounts for
approximately one quarter of overall body length. ref   ref  .

Wolves are built for stamina, possessing features ideal for long distance
travel. Their narrow chests and powerful backs and legs facilitate efficient
locomotion. They are capable of covering several miles trotting at about a pace
of 10 km h  6 mph , and have been known to reach speeds approaching 65 km h  40
mph  during a chase. ref   ref  While thus sprinting, wolves can cover up to 5
meters  16 ft  per bound. ref name  Columbia    ref 



Wolf paws are able to tread easily on a wide variety of terrains, especially
snow. There is a slight webbing between each toe, which allows wolves to move
over snow more easily than comparatively hampered prey. Wolves are digitigrade,
which, with the relative largeness of their feet, helps them to distribute their
weight well on snowy surfaces. The front paws are larger than the hind paws, and
have a fifth digit, a dewclaw, that is absent on hind paws. Bristled hairs and
blunt claws enhance grip on slippery surfaces, and special blood vessels keep
paw pads from freezing. ref name  AP    ref  Scent glands located between a
wolf s toes leave trace chemical markers behind, helping the wolf to effectively
navigate over large expanses while concurrently keeping others informed of its
whereabouts. ref name  AP    

A wolf sometimes seems heavier than it actually is due to its bulky coat, which
is made of two layers. The first layer consists of tough guard hairs designed to
repel water and dirt. The second is a dense, water resistant undercoat that
insulates the wolf. Wolves have distinct winter and summer pelages that
alternate in spring and autumn. Females tend to keep their winter coats further
into the spring than males.

Coloration varies greatly  it runs from gray to gray brown, all the way through
the canine spectrum of white, red, brown, and black. These colors tend to mix in
many populations to form predominantly blended individuals, though it is
certainly not uncommon for an individual or an entire population to be entirely
one color  usually all black or all white . A multicolor coat characteristically
lacks any clear pattern other than it tends to be lighter on the animal s
underside. Fur color sometimes corresponds with a given wolf population s
environment  for example, all white wolves are much more common in areas with
perennial snow cover. Aging wolves acquire a grayish tint in their coats.


At birth, wolf pups tend to have darker fur and blue eyes that will change to a
yellow gold or orange color when the pups are 8 ndash 16 weeks old. ref
name  IWCpups    ref  Though extremely unusual, it is possible for an adult wolf
to retain its blue colored eyes. ref   ref 

Wolves  long, powerful muzzles help distinguish them from coyotes, which have
more narrow, pointed muzzles  and from dogs, which generally have shorter
muzzles. Wolves also differ in certain skull dimensions, having a smaller
orbital angle, for example, than dogs   53 degrees for dogs compared to  45
degrees for wolves  and a comparatively larger cerebra</STYLE>
