A  boomerang  is a simple wooden implement used for various purposes. It is
primarily attributed to Australian Aborigines, but other forms are found amongst
peoples of North East Africa, Arizona Native Americans and in India. The oldest
boomerang found so far was discovered in a cave in the carpathian mountains in
Poland and is believed to be about 20,000 years old. Boomerangs come in many
shapes and sizes depending on its geographic tribal origins and intended
function. The most recognizable type is the returning boomerang, a kind of
Throwing Stick that, when thrown correctly, travels in a curved path and returns
to its point of origin. Other types of boomerang are of the non returning sort,
and indeed, some are not thrown at all but are used in hand to hand combat by
Aboriginal people. Boomerangs can be variously used as hunting weapons,
percussive musical instruments, battle clubs, fire starters, decoys for hunting
waterfowl, and as recreational playthings. The smallest boomerang may be less
than 10 cm from tip to tip, and the largest over 2 meters in length. Tribal
boomerangs may be incised and or painted with designs meaningful to its maker.
Most boomerangs seen today are of the tourist or competition sort, and are
almost invariably of the returning type.

History

Boomerang like devices, including hunting sticks, have been used all over the
world for hunting, religious and recreational activities. Their origin is still
not fully clear. Research has shown that ancient tribes in Europe used special
throwing axes. Also, in ancient Egypt a special type of stick was exclusively
used by the pharaohs for hunting birds. However, the world famous  country of
the boomerang  is Australia, where the Australian Aborigines have used both
boomerangs and hunting sticks for many thousands of years. The name of the
boomerang comes from the Indigenous Australian Turuwal tribe of Aborigines who
lived south of Sydney, Australia.



Today, boomerangs are most used as sporting items. There are different types of
throwing contests  accuracy of return  aussie round  trick catch  maximum time
aloft  fast catch  and endurance  See below . The modern sport boomerang  often
referred to as a  boom  or  rang  , is made of Finnish birch plywood, hardwood,
plastic or composite materials and comes in many different shapes and colors.
Most sport boomerangs typically weigh less than 100 grams, with MTA boomerangs
 boomerangs used for the maximum time aloft event  often under 25 grams.

Design

A returning boomerang is an airfoil. Though it is not a requirement that the
boomerang be in its traditional shape, it is usually flat. A falling boomerang
starts spinning and most then fall in a spiral. When the boomerang is thrown
with high spin, the wings produce lift. Larger boomerangs are used in hunting,
thus they drop on the ground after striking the target. Smaller ones are used in
sport, and are the only boomerangs that return to the thrower. Because of its
rapid spinning, a boomerang flies in a curve rather than a straight line. When
thrown correctly, a boomerang returns to its starting point.

Now in more detail 

Returning boomerangs consist of two or more arms or wings, connected at an
angle. Each wing is shaped as an airfoil, air travels faster over one surface of
an airfoil than the other, as the air is accelerated due to the curvature, thus
creating lift, along what is roughly a plane which intersects the airfoil at a
near right angle along the long axis of the wing.

These wings are set so that the lift created by each wing opposes the lift of
the other, but at an angle such that the flight pattern is constantly shifted as
the forces of lift, drag, speed, rotational inertia etc.  attempt  to reach
equilibrium, see Boomerang engineer.

This is what makes the boomerang  return gracefully to the thrower, fluttering
to a stop in his hand ... when thrown correctly. This is also what makes the
boomerang  rocket straight up into the air before plunging to its shattered
doom ... when thrown incorrectly. With the exception of long distance
boomerangs, they should not be thrown sidearm or like a Frisbee, but rather
throw with the long axis of the wings rotating in an almost vertical plane.

Fast Catch boomerangs usually have three symmetrical wings  in the planform
view , whereas a Long Distance boomerang is most often shaped very similar to a
question mark. Maximum Time Aloft boomerangs have one wing considerably longer
than the other. This feature, along with carefully executed bends and twists in
the wings, help to set up an  auto rotation  effect to maximize the boomerang s
hover time in descending from its highest point in the flight.

Prominent boomerang designer builders include Bob Burwell and Tony Butz from
Australia, Rusty Harding from the USA, Jerri Leu from Brazil and others.

Basic throwing instructions  A right handed boomerang circles towards the left,
a left handed boomerang circles towards the right. Most sport boomerangs are in
the range of 2.5 to about 4 ounces. The range on most of these is between 25  
40 yards  or meters   A right or left handed boomerang can be thrown with either
hand, but the flight direction will depend upon the boomerang, not the thrower.
Throwing a boomerang with the wrong handedness requires a throwing motion that
will feel awkward to many throwers. Beginners should thus take care to get a
boomerang with the correct handedness.  Grasp one wing of the boomerang nearly
vertically so that the other wing points forward and the flat side is away from
you. The other way works also, but this way is usually easier to learn. Holding
the tip by just the end between your thumb and one or two fingers, launch the
boomerang forward quickly while trying more for spin than for very much force.
 The boomerang should flatten out on its own and arc around, sometimes coming to
rest a little in front of the thrower or behind the thrower, but ideally</STYLE>
