The  Cedar Waxwing   Bombycilla cedrorum  is a member of the family
Bombycillidae or waxwing family of passerine birds. It breeds in open wooded
areas in North America, principally southern Canada and the northern United
States.

Description It is 16.5 cm in length and weighs 32 g. It is smaller and browner
than its close relative, the Bohemian Waxwing, which breeds further north and
west. The tail is tipped with yellow or orange depending on diet. Birds that
have fed on berries of introduced Eurasian honeysuckles while growing tail
feathers will have darker orange tipped tail feathers. Adults have a pale yellow
belly. Immature birds are streaked on the throat and flanks, and often do not
have the black mask of the adults.

The flight of waxwings is strong and direct, and the movement of the flock in
flight resembles that of a flock of small pale European Starlings.

Vocalizations The calls of these birds include very high pitched whistles and
buzzy trills often represented as see or sree.

Seasonal movements Outside the breedings season, Cedar Waxwings often feed in
large flocks numbering hundreds of birds. This species is irruptive, with
erratic winter movements, though Most of the population migrates further south
into the United States and beyond, sometimes as far as northern South America.
They will move in huge numbers if berry supplies are low. Rare vagrants reach
western Europe, with two recorded occurrences in Great Britain. Individual
Bohemian Waxwings will occasionally join large winter flocks of Cedar Waxwings.

Birds in winter can be very confiding and will come into gardens for berry
bushes and trees and to splash and drink from fountains or bird baths.


Diet The Cedar Waxwing eats berries and sugary fruit year round, with insects
becoming an important part of the diet in the breeding season. Its fondness for
the small cones of the Eastern Redcedar  a kind of juniper  gave this bird its
common name.

When the end of a twig holds a supply of berries that only one bird at a time
can reach, members of a flock may line up along the twig and pass berries beak
to beak down the line so that each bird gets a chance to eat.

Habitat Preferred habitat consists of trees at the edge of wooded areas, or
 open  forests, especially those that provide access to berry sources as well as
water. Waxwings are attracted to the sound of running water, and love to bathe
and drink from shallow creeks. In urban or suburban environments, waxwings often
favor parkland with well spaced trees, golf courses, cemeteries, or other
landscaping with well spaced trees, bushes that provide berries, and a water
source, including fountains or birdbaths, is always a big plus.

 tree.  ]] Nesting The nest is a loose open cup built with grass and twigs,
 lined with softer materials and supported by a tree branch averaging 2 to 6
 meters above ground but, at times, considerably higher. The outer diameter of
 the nest is approximately 12cm to 16cm.

During courtship, the pair may pass a flower petal or insect back and forth
repeatedly. Usually 4 or 5 eggs are laid and the female incubates them for 12 to
16 days. The eggs are oval shaped with a smooth surface and very little, if any,
gloss. The egg shells are of various shades of light or bluish grey with
irregular, dark brown spots or greyish brown splotches. Both parents build the
nest and feed the young. Typically, there are two broods during the mating
season. Young leave the nest about 14 to 18 days after hatching.

Cedar Waxwings are also known as the Southern Waxwing, Canada Robin, Cedar Bird,
Cherry Bird, or Recellet.

Cedar Waxwings in literature and law According to experts in the writing of
Vladimir Nabokov, this species almost certainly inspired the waxwing mentioned
prominently in his novel [[Pale Fire]].

Waxwings are protected by US Law and may not be kept in captivity in that
country.
