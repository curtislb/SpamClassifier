=21--Shiroo reportedly clashed with Nagasaki city officials in 2003 after his car was dam=
aged when he drove into a hole at a public works site. He tried unsuccessfully to get compens=
ation from the city after his insurance company refused to pay up, according to Japanese br=
oadcaster NHK.

Shiroo also sent a letter to broadcaster TV Asahi to protest recent money scandals linked t=
o Ito, including hidden accounts and public works contracts, Kyodo reported.

Backed by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, Ito was campaigning for his fourth term in o=
ffice before Sunday's elections. He was an active figure in the movement against nuclear p=
roliferation, heading a coalition of Japanese cities calling for the elimination of nucl=
ear weapons.

=22Mayor Ito had a strong and boundless passion for peace,=22 said Sunao Tsuboi, leader of=
 a survivors' group based in Hiroshima, a city also flattened by a U.S. atomic bomb in 1945.

Commonly known as yakuza, Japan's organized crime groups are typically involved in real e=
state and construction kickback schemes, extortion, gambling, the sex industry, gunrun=
ning and drug trafficking.

The yakuza also have had a long-standing political alliance with right-wing nationalist=
s in Japan, although authorities did not indicate that Tuesday's attack was politically m=
otivated.

Organized crime groups are behind most shootings in Japan, with two-thirds of the country=
's 53 known shootings last year being gang-related, according to the National Police Agen=
cy. Police estimate there are about 84,500 gangsters across Japan.=20
