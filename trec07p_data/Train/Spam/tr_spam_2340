<p align="right" style="margin-top:0;"><b>April 11, 2007</b></p>
<p><b>&ldquo;The Big Picture&rdquo;</b></p>
<p>It was a wacky, crazy day for <em>Trending123</em> folks.&nbsp;  At least it seemed that way to me after spending time in our trading room.&nbsp;  I&rsquo;m in there all the time and one of the things I like most about hanging out with my subscribers each day, is being able to get an instant, accurate temperature on market participants and what they are feeling.</p>
<p>Today the overriding sentiment is screaming: I&rsquo;m anxious and a little crazed.&nbsp;  Hmm, who does that remind me of?&nbsp;  Oh, yes, our volatile markets!&nbsp;  I really believe that the markets are neurotic and so are we.</p>
<a href="http://confirm.investorplace.com/c/conf?CEJLHSLINK-3317975-7WM199-7WM199-iplacereports@speedy.uwaterloo.ca"><img align="right" src="http://images.investorplace.com/e_images/jlhs/easier_than_123.gif" width="120" height="80" border="0" style="margin-left:8px;"></a>
<p>Since you aren&rsquo;t a <em>Trending123</em> subscriber (though I hope you will become one someday soon), you don&rsquo;t know about my Buy Alerts.&nbsp;  I send out A LOT of &lsquo;em.&nbsp;  Well, it&rsquo;s funny to me because it seems that when I recommend a stock that dips, everyone is paying attention and gets right in on the stock.&nbsp;  But when I send out an alert on a stock that moves right up, everyone gets a little freaked out and acts like they never received that email.</p>

<p><b>Meet the RST</b></p>
<p>Right now, because of this highly volatile market we are in, there are a bunch of stocks that are trading in a familiar pattern known as the RST.&nbsp;  It stands for Reverse Symmetrical Triangle.&nbsp;  <a href="http://confirm.investorplace.com/c/conf?CEJLHSHS0410-3317975-7WM199-7WM199-iplacereports@speedy.uwaterloo.ca">You can learn more about it here.</a></p>

<p><b>Williams Percent Range</b></p>
<p>The Williams Percent Range, usually abbreviated &ldquo;Williams %R,&rdquo; is one of the top three indicators we use at <em>Trending123</em> to identify trend reversals.&nbsp;  It&rsquo;s named after its developer, Larry Williams.&nbsp;  Williams used a scale of 0% to 100% to show the relationship of the current closing price relative to the range of prices from the highest to the lowest over a certain period of time.&nbsp;  As the closing price approaches the high, the Williams %R will approach 0%.&nbsp;  And as the closing price approaches the low, the Williams %R will approach 100%.</p>
<p>The Williams %R gives us an easy-to-read signal for when the trend might be turning bullish or bearish.&nbsp;  If the Williams %R rises above the 50% line, it&rsquo;s bullish.&nbsp;  If it falls below the 50% line, it&rsquo;s bearish.&nbsp;  Even better, when you use the Williams %R in conjunction with two other top <em>Trending123</em> indicators&mdash;the Aroon and the PPO&mdash;you&rsquo;ve got three tools that together allow you to identify what I call 1-2-3 bullish and bearish trend reversals.&nbsp;  And as <em>Trending123</em> subscribers have seen again and again, that&rsquo;s where the best profits are.</p>

<p>And for some reason, when a stock is stuck in this pattern, people become a little edgy!&nbsp;  It&rsquo;s psychologically so mind-boggling that people seem to go a little nuts as they follow it.&nbsp;  The pattern is jumpy, no doubt about it.&nbsp;  And that&rsquo;s why if you own EOG or HMY for example and you are following the charts, you probably hate both of these stocks.&nbsp;  My <em>Trending123</em> subscribers certainly do.&nbsp;  But not because the stocks don&rsquo;t continue to be potential money-makers for them &mdash; they definitely are still holding steady in the <em>Trending123</em> portfolio.</p>
<p>So then why the hatred for these stocks?</p>
<p>Because the buying pressure in this market is causing stocks to enter this RST pattern&mdash;the pattern that makes you feel like you are trapped in a Fun House and you&rsquo;re not sure what is going on!&nbsp;  It&rsquo;s intense.&nbsp;  It&rsquo;s volatile.&nbsp;  It will make you feel like pulling your hair out because you will feel out of control.</p>
<p>One of my subscribers recently asked me why it seems like the market will open up in one direction and then gyrate to another and then gyrate back to the original location again?&nbsp;  Plain and simple: it&rsquo;s because everyone is reacting.&nbsp;  And as I have mentioned before and will continue to reiterate until everyone knows it like they know their name&mdash;you must not react to the market.&nbsp;  You want to be an ACTor not a REACTor.</p>
<p>Like do you notice how volume comes in when a stock goes up <i>and</i> volume comes in when a stock goes down?&nbsp;  Everybody is <u>reacting</u> to what has already happened.&nbsp;  And that&rsquo;s why it is so easy for the market participants&mdash;the people with the most money&mdash;to fleece the people with the least amount of money.&nbsp;  Nobody likes stocks where they should like them.&nbsp;  They like them at current levels.&nbsp;  They like them when everything seems rosy and picture-perfect.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0;"><b>Stuck in the Volatility Vortex?</b></p>
<p>It sure as heck feels like we are getting tossed around in the market these days!&nbsp;  Some people are starting to get a little nervous&mdash;for good reason!</p>
<p>The Dow drops 400 points one day.&nbsp;  It jumps 200 points another day.&nbsp;  Then it falls 150 points again.&nbsp;  Then up 45 once more.&nbsp;  Back and forth, back and forth.</p>
<p>So how are my <em>Trending123</em> subscribers are taking it all in stride?&nbsp;  How can they concentrate on the opportunities that await them rather than focusing on the stress?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you the secret: the charts are telling us to expect a stealth bull market in the weeks ahead.&nbsp;  And the charts don&rsquo;t lie.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to see you get your share of the profits.&nbsp;  <a href="http://confirm.investorplace.com/c/conf?CEJLHSLINK-3317975-7WM199-7WM221-iplacereports@speedy.uwaterloo.ca">Click here to view a free seminar that will show you a few of the profit opportunities that lay ahead.</a></p>
