 Although this proposal might come to you as a surprise,since is from someone you do not know or have seen before, but based on recomendations,I gathered  from a very reliable source here here in Nigeria. I am the Director,fund  coordinator of the finance contract departmant of Nigeria ports authority.  The crux of this letter is that the finance/contract department of the NPA
delibrately over inflated the contract value of various contract awarded, In the course of the disbursement,my office was able to track down the sum  of US$23.5M (Twenty Three Million, Five Hundredš Thousand U.S Dollars) as  the over invoiced sum.This money is now floating in the NPA domicilliary  account with the Central Bank of Nigeria(CBN).I and my colleagues now want
to quickly transfer this fund to a safe norminated foreign account for  possible investment. We are not allowed as a matter of government policy toc operate any foreign account because of our status as civil/publiC servants.hence the need to solicit for your full banking details, to enable
 us transfer this money into your account.
 Upon your acceptance this proposal,we have also agreed on a sharing ration:  1.30% for you as the account owner 2.60% for I and my colleagues 3.10% will be set aside to defray all incidental expenses both locally and  internationally during the cause of this transaction.
 Furthermore we shall be coming over to your country when the money is finanlly in your account and we shall be relying on your advise as regards to investment of our share,be informed that this business is genuine and 100%safe considering the high powered government officials involved.
 Send the following information: 1.Your company name,address,bank name,address and account number 2.Your phone number for effective communication
 This is to effect the swift transfer of this fund into your account in less
