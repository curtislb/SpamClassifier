The  stoat   Mustela erminea  is a small mammal of the family Mustelidae. It is
also known as the  short tailed weasel , the  wild otter , and the  ermine .

Natural history The stoat can be found almost everywhere throughout the northern
temperate, subarctic and arctic regions, that is in Europe, Asia, Canada and the
United States  though it is absent from the south eastern US . It was introduced
into New Zealand in an unsuccessful attempt to control the rabbit population and
is considered a pest because it eats the eggs and young of native birds. Stoats
are largely nocturnal or crepuscular but will sometimes come out during the day.

Physical Description The stoat is a member of the family Mustelidae, which also
includes other weasels, mink, otters, ferret, badgers, polecats, the wolverine,
martens, the tayra, the fisher and in some taxonomical classifications skunks.
This is one of the most species rich families in order Carnivora. Although it
inhabits northern latitudes the stoat is built long and thin, leading to an
increased surface area to volume ratio and increased dissipation of heat from
its body. The advantage of this shape is that it is one of the few species able
to follow burrowing animals into their own homes. It partly compensates for this
shape by having short legs, small ears, a fast metabolism and, in winter, thick
fur. Stoats may grow up to 30 cm long, with males much larger than the females.
In most areas it coexists with the Least Weasel  Mustela nivalis, also known as
the European common weasel , and in this situation competition is reduced by the
Least weasel, the smallest member of order Carnivora. Where the Least weasel is
absent the stoat is smaller   70 g .

,    the Virgin Queen    painted with an ermine. In this painting the stoat has,
unnaturally, black spots over its entire body.]]The stoat s coat is a rich
medium brown with an off white belly. In winter, the coat is thicker and in
regions that experience an inch or more of snow for at least forty days of the
year the color changes to clean white. This white fur is known as  ermine ,
hence the scientific name. At this stage the stoat itself may be referred to as
ermine, or as being  in ermine . The winter stoat has been used in art as a
symbol of purity or virginity. The white fur was highly prized, and used in the
robes of the Lord Chief Justice of England. The furs would be sewn together
making a pattern of black dots. A version of this pattern is used in heraldry as
ermine tinture. In all seasons the stoat has a pronounced black tip on its tail.
The black tip probably serves as a decoy to predators, which would include
almost any carnivore large enough to eat a stoat  e.g. wolves, foxes,
wolverines, and some birds of prey . This kind of coat is very similar to the
coat of the long tailed weasel  Mustela frenata , a related animal of about the
same size which also moults into white in the northern part of its range, and it
is easy to confuse these kinds of weasels. The North American name for the
stoat, the  Short tailed weasel  arose because its tail length distinguishes it
from the long tailed weasel. In general it is found farther north. Both species
can be distinguished from the Least Weasel because the Least weasel always lacks
a black tip on its tail.

Diet The stoat is an opportunistic carnivore. It eats rabbits  rodents such as
the mouse, vole and rat  other small mammals  birds and their eggs and young 
and sometimes fish, reptiles, amphibians, and invertebrates. It is a very
skillful tree climber and can descend a trunk headfirst, like a squirrel. The
stoat is capable of killing animals much larger than itself. When it is able to
obtain more meat than it can eat it will engage in  surplus killing  and often
stores the extra food for later. Like other mustelids it typically dispatches
its prey by biting into the base of the skull to get at the centers of the brain
responsible for such important biological functions as breathing. Sometimes it
will also make preliminary bite</STYLE>
