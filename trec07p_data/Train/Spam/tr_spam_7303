Congratulations!!!


We are pleased to inform you of the result of the just concluded annual final
draws of Sachsen Lotto-GmbH Program.

Sachsen Lotto-GmbH draws was conducted from an exclusive list of 25,000,000 e-
mail addresses of individual and corporate bodies picked  by an advanced
automated random computer ballot search from the internet as part of our
international promotions program which we conduct every year.No tickets were
sold.

After this automated computer ballot, your e-mail address attached to serial
number 06-3434 drew the lucky numbers 7-17-21-26-37-42 which consequently
emerged you as one of first fifty (50) lucky winners in this category.

You have therefore been approved for a lump sum payout of ?1,000,000.00 (One
Million EURO) in cash credited to file SL/06-GmbH/4009. This is from a total
cash prize of ?50 Million Euro shared amongst the first fifty (50) lucky
winners in this category.

This year Lottery Program Jackpot is the largest ever for Sachsen Lotto-GmbH.
The estimated ?50 million jackpot would be the sixth-biggest in Europe  
history.
The biggest was the ?363 million jackpot that went to two winners in a Febuary
2000 drawing of The Big Game Mega Millions' predecessor.

Your fund is now deposited in an offshore bank with a hardcover insurance. Due
to the mix up of some numbers and names, we advice that you keep this award
from public notice until your claim has been processed and your money remitted
to your nominated bank account as this is part of our security protocol to
avoid double claiming or unwarranted taking advantage of this program by the
general public.
