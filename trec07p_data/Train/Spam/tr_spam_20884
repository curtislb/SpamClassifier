 Covina  is a city in Los Angeles County, California about 22 miles east of
downtown Los Angeles. The population was 46,837 at the 2000 census.

Covina is often mistaken for West Covina, which is actually larger in both area
and population, located to its south and west. Irwindale lies to the west, Azusa
and Glendora are to the north, the unincorporated community of Charter Oak to
the northeast, San Dimas to the east, and Walnut to the southeast.

It has been a sister city of Jalapa, Mexico, since 1964. A replica of a giant
stone Olmec head, located in front of the city police station, was given to the
city in 1989 by the Mexican state of Veracruz.

History The city was founded in 1882 by Joseph Swift Phillips, and tradition has
it that it was named by either he, his wife Mrs. Cornelia  Hunt  Phillips, or
his surveyor Frederick Eaton, in 1885 when the survey was finished. One of them
supposedly noticed the many vineyards nestled in the San Gabriel Valley and
devised the name  Covina  from  cove of vineyards .

The city was incorporated in 1901. However, it would be orange and grapefruit
trees, not vineyards, that would soon blanket the area and make it famous. By
1909, the city was the third largest orange producer in the world, and it still
claimed to have  the best oranges in the world  as late as the 1950s. Since
World War II, however, the orange groves have been largely replaced by single
family and multiple family dwellings.

The city s slogan,  One Mile Square and All There  was coined by Mrs F. E
Wolfarth, the winner of a 1922 slogan contest sponsored by the Chamber of
Commerce, when the incorporated area of the city was only  some say slightly
less than  one square mile, making it the smallest city in area in the country.

Today, it claims to have the largest movie theater multiplex in Los Angeles
County, the AMC 30.

The Covina Valley Historical Society maintains an extensive archive illustrating
the city s history in the 1911 built Firehouse Jail Museum, Covina s first
municipal building, located immediately behind City Hall in Covina s Old Town.

Geography Covina is located at  34.091609,  117.879193 .

No freeways pass through the city limits, although it is centered in the midst
of Interstate 210  Foothill Freeway  to the north, Interstate 10  San Bernadino
Freeway  to the south, Interstate 605  San Gabriel River Freeway  to the west,
and the California State Route 57  Santa Ana Freeway  to the east. The Southern
Pacific Railroad, which reached Covina in 1884, and the Metrolink San Bernardino
Line pass through the city just north of the downtown area. The town is located
at the foot of the San Gabriel Mountains in the San Gabriel Valley.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 18.1
km    7.0 mi   . 18.1 km    7.0 mi    of it is land and 0.14  of it is water.
