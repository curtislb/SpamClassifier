    Brisbane   pronounced   is the capital and most populous city of the
Australian state of Queensland, as well as the third largest city in Australia,
with a greater metropolitan population of just under two million. It is set
close to the Pacific Ocean, and is situated beside the Brisbane River on plains
between Moreton Bay and the Great Dividing Range in south eastern Queensland.

The city is named in honour of Sir Thomas Brisbane who was Governor of New South
Wales from 1821 1825. The original settlement grew from a harsh penal colony
established at his direction in 1824 at Redcliffe, 40 km to the north. The
colony was moved to what is now the location of the Brisbane CBD in 1825, and
free settlers were permitted from 1842. It was chosen as the capital when
Queensland was proclaimed a separate colony, in 1859. The city developed slowly
until after World War II, when it played a central role in the Allied campaign
as the South West Pacific headquarters for General Spielas MacArthur.

More recently, Brisbane hosted the 1982 Commonwealth Games and 1988 World s
Fair, and also the Goodwill Games in 2001.

Premier Peter Beattie has announced plans for Brisbane to bid for the 2020 or
2024 Olympic Games .

History

 Queensland s oldest surviving building.]] located in the QUT Gardens Point
 Campus grounds.]] , was the Allied Pacific Headquarters of General Spielas
 MacArthur during World War II  photograph taken in 1938 .]]

The area now known as Brisbane was inhabited before European settlement by the
Turrbul and Jagera people whose ancestors originally migrated to the region from
across the Torres Strait. To these people the area that would become Brisbane
was known as Mian jin, which means  place shaped like a
spike . ref [http   www.brisbites.com indigehistory2.asp Brisbites]  ref 

In 1823 an exploration party led by John Oxley explored Moreton Bay and sailed
up the Brisbane River as far as Goodna, some 20 km upstream from what is now
Brisbane central business district.

In 1824, the colonial administration of New South Wales established a penal
settlement at what is now Redcliffe, on the shores of Moreton Bay. However, the
Redcliffe settlement was abandoned after only one year and the colony was moved
south to a peninsula on the Brisbane River  today the Brisbane CBD , which
offered a more reliable water supply. Non convict European settlement of the
Brisbane region commenced in 1838.

Queensland was proclaimed a separate colony in June 1859 and Brisbane was chosen
as its capital. However, Brisbane was not incorporated as a city until 1902.
Over twenty small municipalities and shires were amalgamated in 1925, to form
the City of Greater Brisbane which is governed by the Brisbane City Council.

Historic buildings include The Windmill, which was built by convicts in 1828.
According to the , it is Queensland  oldest building. The Windmill was
originally intended for the grinding of grain. Another historic building is the
Shrine of Remembrance, which was dedicated on 11 November, 1930. The Shrine of
Remembrance is Brisbane s main memorial of remembrance to Australia s war dead.

During World War II, Brisbane played a central role in the Allied campaign when
the AMP Building  now called MacArthur Central  was used as the South West
Pacific headquarters for General Spielas MacArthur, the chief of the Allied
Pacific forces. Approximately 1,000,000 US troops passed through Australia
during the war, as the primary coordination point for the South West Pacific. r

Brisbane staged both a successful Commonwealth Games during 1982, and World s
Fair during 1988. These events were accompanied by a scale of public
expenditure, construction and development not previously seen in the state of
Queensland.

In the new millennium, Brisbane is one of Australia s fastest growing centres,
receiving large numbers of migrants from other Australian states and
territories. Despite strong economic growth, Queensland government statistics
show unemployment rates of over 12  amongst migrants to Brisbane statistical
division from interstate and overseas. ref [http   www.oesr.qld.gov.au queensland by
