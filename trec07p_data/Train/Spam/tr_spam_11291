See Taxonomy section   

 Crickets , family  Gryllidae   also known as  true crickets  , are insects
somewhat related to grasshoppers and more closely related to katydids or bush
crickets  order Orthoptera . They have somewhat flattened bodies and long
antennae.

Crickets are known for their chirp  which only male crickets can do  male wings
have ridges or  teeth  that act like a  comb and file  instrument . The left
forewing has a thick rib  a modified vein  which bears 50 to 300 minute  teeth .
The chirp is generated by raising their left forewing to a 45 degree angle and
rubbing it against the upper hind edge of the right forewing, which has a thick
scraper  Berenbaum 1995 . This sound producing action is called  stridulation 
and the song is species specific. There are two types of cricket songs  a
calling song and a courting song. The calling song attracts females and repels
other males, and is fairly loud. The courting song is used when a female cricket
is near, and is a very quiet song. Female crickets have a long needlelike egg 
laying organ  ovipositor .

Crickets chirp at different rates depending on their species and the temperature
of their environment. Most species chirp at higher rates the higher the
temperature is  approx. 60 chirps a minute at 13  C in one common species  each
species has its own rate . The relationship between temperature and the rate of
chirping is known as Dolbear s Law. In fact, according to this law, it is
possible to calculate the temperature in Fahrenheit by adding 39 to the number
of chirps produced in 15 seconds by the snowy tree cricket common in the United
States.

To hear the mating call of other crickets, a cricket has ears located on its
knees, just below the joint of the front legs.

There are about 900 species of crickets. They tend to be nocturnal and are often
confused with grasshoppers, which are related because they have a similar body
structure including jumping hind legs.

In 1970, Dr. William H. Cade discovered that the parasitic tachinid fly [[Ormia
ochracea]] is attracted to the song of the male cricket, and uses it to locate
the male in order to deposit her larvae on him. It was the first example of a
natural enemy that locates its host or prey using the mating signal. Since then,
many species of crickets have been found to be carrying the same parasitic fly,
or related species.

Popular culture

Crickets are popular pets and are considered good luck in Asia, especially China
where they are kept in cages  Carrera 1991 . It is also common to have them as
caged pets in some European countries, particularly in the Iberian Peninsula.
Cricket fighting as a gambling or sports betting pastime also occurs,
particularly in Macao.

The folklore and mythology surrounding crickets is extensive.  ref   Cricket
singing means rain  semiotic meaning of insects in the district of Pedra Branca,
Bahia State, northeastern Brazil  [http   www.scielo.br scielo.php?script sci_arttext pid S0001 
37652006000100007],   ref 

The singing of crickets in the folklore of Brazil and elsewhere is sometimes
taken to be a sign of impending rain, or of a financial windfall. In Brazilian
history, the sudden chirping of a cricket heralded the sighting of land for the
crew of captain   lvar N    ez Cabeza de Vaca, just as their water supply had
run out.  Lenko and Papavero 1996 .

In Caraguatatuba, Brazil, a black cricket in a room is said to portend illness 
a gray one money  and a green one hope  Lenko and Papavero 1996 . In Alagoas
state, northeast Brazil, a cricket announces death, thus it is killed if it
chirps in a house  Ara  jo 1977 . In the village of Capueiru  u, Bahia State, a
constantly chirping cricket foretells pregnancy, but if it pauses, money is
expected  K.L.G. Lima, unpublished data . The mole cricket locally known as
 paquinha ,  jeguinho ,  cachorrinho d   gua , or  cava ch  o   genera
Scapteriscus and Neocurtilla, Gryllotalpidae  is said to predict rain when it
digs into the ground  Fowler 1994 .

In Barbados, a loud cricket means money is coming in  hence, a cricket must not
be killed or evicted if it chirps inside a house. However, another type of
cricket that is less noisy forebodes illness or death.  Forde 1988  In Zambia,
the Gryllotalpa africanus cricket is held to bring good fortune to anyone who
sees it  Mbata 1999 .

Crickets may also be eaten in some cultures, and are popular as live food for
carnivorous pets.

In comedy, the sound of crickets may be used to humorously indicate a dead
silence when a response or activity is expected. For example, if a comedian in a
TV show tells a bad joke, instead of the audience laughing, crickets may chirp.

The Disney corporation has used a number of notable cricket characters in their
animated movies through the ages. Most of these characters represent good. For
example, in the movie  Pinnochio,  Jiminy Cricket is honored with the position
of the title character s conscience. In  Mulan,  Cri kee is carried in a cage as
a symbol of luck, as in many Asian countries.
