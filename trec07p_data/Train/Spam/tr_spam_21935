Dear valued member.
This letter is a part of the official program initiated by the United American Health Department – please, read it to the end if you regularly buy drugs on the Web.
Be careful when choosing where to buy your meds from – try to cling to pharmacies that have already made a good name for themselves, such as USDrugs. Always make sure that your online drugstore is a licensed one.
Hope that you take our advice seriously. Take care.
