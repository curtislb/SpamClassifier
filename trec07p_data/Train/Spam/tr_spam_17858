<center> <=21--The legislation requires a troop withdrawal to begin July 1 if Bush cannot=
 certify that the Iraqi government is making progress in disarming militias, reducing sec=
tarian violence and forging political agreements, otherwise by Oct. 1.

While the beginning of a withdrawal is mandated, the balance of the pullback is merely advi=
sory, to take place by April 1, 2008. Troops could remain after that date to conduct counter=
terrorism missions, protect U.S. facilities and personnel and train Iraqi security forc=
es.

Abe was given the coveted invitation to the Camp David presidential retreat in part as a ges=
ture of appreciation for Tokyo's commitment to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Japan is t=
he largest financial contributor, after the United States, for the rebuilding effort in I=
raq, and is the third largest contributor in Afghanistan. Japanese defense forces have co=
nducted refueling operations for the U.S. and coalition forces.

Abe expressed thanks =22for the noble sacrifice the United States is making=22 in Iraq. On=
 Thursday, the Japanese leader went to Arlington National Cemetery to pay respects to U.S.=
 war dead, and visited injured troops at Bethesda Naval Hospital.
