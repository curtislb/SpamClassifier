The  Drina   Serbian and Bosnian             or Drina  is a river in the Balkan
Peninsula. A 346 kilometer long right tributary of the Sava River, it forms most
of the border between Bosnia and Hercegovina and Serbia. Its name is derived
from the Latin name of the river, Drinus.

Length and navigation

The Drina is formed by the confluence of the Tara and the Piva rivers, both of
which flow from Montenegro and converge on the border of Bosnia and Herzegovina,
at the village of     epan Polje. The Drina flows generally northward for 346
kilometers  of which 206 kilometers is along the border of Bosnia and
Herzegovina and Serbia  into the Sava, near the village of Crna Bara in
northwestern Serbia. Measured from the source of the Tara, its longer headwater,
the Drina is 487 kilometers long.

The river is not navigable, however, together with the Tara it represents the
main kayaking and rafting attraction in the Balkans.

Course

Origin and gorges

The Drina originates between the slopes of the Magli   and Pivska planina
mountains, between the villages of     epan Polje  in Montenegro  and Hum
 Bosnia and Herzegovina . Originally flowing to the west, it makes a large curve
to the northeast, around the Malu  a mountains. Next, it flows through the
villages of Kosman, Prijedjel, Du  eli,   elikovo Polje, Kopilovi, Trbu    e,
Brod and the town of Fo  a. It receives the Sutjeska, Bjelava and Bistrica
rivers from the left and the   ehotina at Fo  a from the right.

Here the Drina carved the longest one of the several gorges on its course, the
45 kilometer long Suhi Dol Biserovina gorge between the southernmost slopes of
the Jahorina mountains from the north and the Kova   mountains from the south.
The villages of Zlatari, Jo  anica, Ustikolina, Cvilin, Zebina   uma, Osanica,
Kolovarice, Vrani  i, Mravinjac, Biljin, Vitkovi  i and Zup  i  i are located in
the gorge, as well as the town of Gora  de. The river receives the Kolunska
rijeka and the Osanica as tributaries from the left.

The Drina continues to the northeast, flowing close to the villages of   u  elo,
Od  ak, Kopa  i and Ustipra  a, entering the 26 km long Me  e  a gorge carved
between the Vu  evica mountains from the south and the southern slopes of the
Devetak mountains from the north. The narrowest part of the Me  e  a gorge is
Tijesno, the 8 kilometer long section of the gorge where the river is at its
narrowest  only 12 meters wide , but also at its deepest  12 meters . Here it
receives the Pra  a river from the left and the Janjina and Lim rivers from the
right. The villages of Trbosilje, Me  e  a and Orahovci are located in the
gorge, which is for the most part flooded by the artificial Vi  egrad lake,
created by the Vi  egrad hydro electric power plant.

At the town of Vi  egrad, the Drina receives the Rzav river from the right and
turns northwest at the Suva Gora mountain into the Klotijevac gorge. The gorge
is 38 kilometers long and up to 1 kilometer deep, carved between the mountains
of Bok  anica  from the west  and Zvijezda  from the east . The villages of
Sase, Resnik,   urevi  i and Gornje   titarevo lie in the gorge and the Kukal
river flows into the Drina from the right. At the Slap village, the Drina
receives the   epa river from the right and turns sharply to the west, becoming
a border river between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia near the village of
Jago  tica.

Border river

The Drina flows between the mountains of Zvijezda and Su  ica and it is flooded
by the artificial Lake Peru  ac on the northern slopes of the Tara mountain,
created by the Bajina Ba  ta power plant. The villages of Prohi  i and Osatica
 in Bosnia and Herzegovina  are located on the lake, as well as the ruins of the
medieval town of   ur  evac. The river is dammed at the village of Peru  ac,
where a strong well springs out from the Tara mountain, flowing into the Drina
as a waterfall. In addition, the waters of Drina are used for several fish ponds
for the California trout spawning.
