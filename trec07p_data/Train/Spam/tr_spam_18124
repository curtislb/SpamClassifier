 Sailing  is the skillful art of controlling the motion of a sailing ship or
sailboat, across a body of water. The force of the wind on the sails propels
sailing vessels. Today, for most people, sailing is recreation, an activity
pursued for the joy of being on the water and pursuing the mastery of skills
needed to maneuver a sailboat in varying sea and wind conditions. Recreational
sailing can be further divided into Racing, Cruising and  Daysailing  or Dinghy
sailing.

Throughout history sailing has been instrumental in the development of
civilization. The earliest representation of a ship under sail appears on an
Egyptian vase from about 3500 BC. ref Casson, Lionel. 1971. Ships and Seamanship
in the Ancient World  ref 

Introduction A sailboat or sailing ship moves forward because of the reaction to
the inertia of moving air on its sails. Since the dawn of history this vital
technology has afforded mankind greater mobility and capacity for fishing, trade
and warfare. From moving the stones of the great pyramids from Aswan to Giza to
allowing man to migrate throughout Polynesia to Nelson s defeat of the French
Navy at the Battle of Trafalgar, mankind s history has been intertwined with
this seemingly simple technology.

The physics of sailing The energy that drives a sailboat is harnessed by
manipulating the relative movement of wind and water speed  if there is no
difference in movement, such as on a calm day or when the wind and water current
are moving in the same direction, there is no energy to be extracted and the
sailboat will not be able to do anything but drift. Where there is a difference
in motion, then there is energy to be extracted at the interface, and the
sailboat does this by placing the sail s  in the air and the hull s  in the
water.

Sails are airfoils and work by using an airflow set up by the motion of the
boat. This is the apparent wind, which is the relative velocity of the wind
relative to the boats motion . They generate lift using the air that flows
around them. The air flowing at the sail surface is not the true wind ref As
would be seen by a wind in relation to the boat which also has a velocity. The
curved surface of a sail serves to deflect the air. Deflecting the air results
in a reaction force on the sail and rigging, which pushes the boat in a
direction opposite to the deflection. It is often said that lift is generated by
the pressure differential on the sails, but this is not entirely true  the
pressure differential deflects the air, but it is the deflection that generates
the force. Since the air behind the sailboat has been deflected, it now has less
energy and is slower and is often called dirty air. Racing sailors try to avoid
sailing in dirty air and attempt to give dirty air to opponents where possible.
A common technique is trying to get upwind of an opponent, and make them sail in
your dirty air, slowing them down  ref .

The sail alone is not sufficient to drive the boat in any desired direction, as
a sail by itself would only to push a boat in the same direction as the wind.
Sailboats overcome this by having another physical object below the water line.
These include, a keel, centerboard, or some other form of underwater foil or
even the hull itself  as in catamarans without centreboard or in a traditional
proa . Thus, you could think of the physical portion of the boat which is below
water as functioning as a  second sail . Having two surfaces against the wind
and water enables the sailor to travel in almost any direction and to generate
an additional source of lift from the water. The flow of water over the
underwater hull portions creates a hydrodynamic force. The combination of the
aerodynamic force from the sails and the hydrodynamic force from the underwater
hull section allows motion in almost any direction, except straight into the
wind. This can be likened, in simple terms, to squeezing a wet bar of soap with
two hands which causes it to shoot out in a direction perpendicular to both
opposing forces. Depending on the efficiency of the rig, the angle of travel
relative to the true wind can be as little as 35 degrees to over 80 degrees.
This angle is called tacking angle
[http   members.ozemail.com.au  storerm Pdr PDRmeasurepointingleeway.html]. With
a 35 degree tacking angle on either side of the wind, it is possible for a
sailboat to sail directly over 290 degrees of the compass. ref 360   2x35  
290degrees  ref
