 Lacrosse  is a team sport that is played with either ten players  men field 
six players  men box,indoor  or twelve players  women , each of whom uses a
netted stick  the crosse  in order to pass and catch a very hard rubber ball
with the aim of scoring goals  each worth one point traditionally, but Major
League Lacrosse uses a two point goal for goals scored from a distance of 16
yards or greater from the goal ref   ref   by propelling the ball into the
opponent s goal. The team scoring the most points after two halves, of varying
length from competition to competition, and overtime if necessary, wins. ref

Most popular in North America, lacrosse is Canada s official national summer
sport ref name  National Sports of Canada Act    ref  and the fastest growing
sport in the United States. ref name  fastest growing sport     ref 

In its modern form, men s lacrosse is played on a field of grass, artificial
turf, or field turf. Each team is composed of 10 players on the field at a time 
three attackmen, three midfielders, three defenders and one goaltender. In men s
lacrosse, players wear protective equipment on their heads, shoulders, arms, and
hands, as body checking is an integral part of the game, and stick checks to the
arms and hands are considered legal. Women s lacrosse is played in a similar
manner except with two additional midfielders per team. Players of women s
lacrosse need only wear protective eyewear  except for the goaltender, who wears
additional padding, usually consisting of a helmet, shin guards, and chest pad,
and most goalies do not wear arm pads , as contact is not permitted apart from
minor stick checks.

Evolution of the Game

Lacrosse was invented by Native North Americans. Its name was dehuntshigwa es in
Onondaga   men hit a rounded object  , da nah wah uwsdi in Eastern Cherokee
  little war  , Tewaarathon in Mohawk language   little brother of war  , and
baaga adowe in Ojibwe   knocking about of balls  . ref   ref 

The game was named lacrosse by early French observers. It is widely and
inaccurately believed that the name stems from the French term  crosse , for the
shepherd s crooklike crosier carried by bishops as a symbol of office. Jesuit
missionary Jean de Br  beuf noted the resemblance between the crosier and the
shape of the racket stick in the Relation des J  suites around 1640. In fact,
the term crosse is a general word in French for any type of bat or stick used in
a ball game. The name lacrosse is simply a reflection of this term, and perhaps
a shorthand for a phrase such as  le jeu de la crosse   the game of the
stick . ref   ref 

Early players concentrated on first injuring their opponents with their sticks,
and then moving easily to the goal. Games could be played on a pitch over a mile
wide and sometimes lasted for days. Often players were gravely injured or even
killed. Early balls were made out of the heads of the enemy, deerskin, clay,
stone, and sometimes wood. Lacrosse has played a significant role in the
community and religious life of tribes across the continent for many years.
Early lacrosse was characterized by deep spiritual involvement, befitting the
spirit of combat in which it was undertaken. Those who took part did so in the
role of warriors, with the goal of bringing glory and honor to themselves and
their tribes, and as a religious ritual. ref   ref  The game was said to be
played  for the pleasure of the Creator. 

, circa 1846 1850.]] Lacrosse was the first Native American sport. Lacrosse has
witnessed great modifications since its origins in the 15th century, but many
aspects of the sport remain the same. In the Native North American version, each
team consisted of about 100 to 1,000 men on a field that stretched from about
500 yards to a couple of miles long. ref name  STX    ref       UNSOURCED
STATEMENT please find source  Rather than having traditional goals where the
ball has to pass through, many of the Native teams used a large rock or tree
which the deerskin ball had to hit in order to earn points.    These lacrosse
games lasted from sun up to sun down for two to three days. These games were
played to settle inter tribal disputes, to toughen young braves in preparation
for future combat and to give thanks to the Creator. The Alqonquin tribes
referred to the sport as  baggatway . ref name  STX    The game became known to
Westerners when a French Jesuit Missionary, Jean de Br  beuf, saw the Iroquois
Natives play it in 1636. ref   ref 

     UNSOURCED PARAGRAPH  In 1763, after Canada had become British, the game was
used by the Natives to carry out an ingenious military deception. On the 2 June,
