A  parish  is a type of administrative subdivision. It is used by some Christian
churches, usually liturgical churches, and also by the civil government in a
number of countries  see [[civil parish]] . The term Parish derives from Anglo 
Fr. parosse  1075 , later paroche  1292 , both forms stem from O.Fr. paroisse,
which itself originates from Latin parochia  diocese , which on its part is from
the Greek word                  for  district  or  diocese .

Ecclesiastical parishes A parish is a territorial subdivision of a diocese,
eparchy or bishopric, within the Roman Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion,
the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Church of Sweden, and of some other churches.
The word  parish  is also used more generally to refer to the collection of
people who attend a particular church. In this usage, a parish minister is one
who serves a congregation.

Roman Catholic Church

 Main article  [[Parish  Catholic Church ]]

In the Catholic Church, each parish has one  parish [[priest]]   as he is
usually called in England, Ireland and Australia, among other places  or
 pastor   as he is called in the United States, among other places , who has
responsibility and canonical authority over the parish  the Latin for this post
is parochus .

A parish priest may have one or more fellow priests assisting him. In Catholic
usage this priest is technically a  parochial vicar , but is commonly called an
 associate pastor  or  assistant pastor   or just  associate  or  assistant  , a
curates, or vicars   common as they are, these terms are inaccurate and many
dioceses have recently begun using the canonical term  parochial vicar  even in
general parish communications  bulletins and the like .

Each parish normally has a central church, called the parish church, where
religious services take place. Some larger parishes or parishes that have been
combined under one pastor may have two or more such churches, or the parish may
be responsible for chapels  sometimes called  chapels of ease   located at some
distance from the parish church for the convenience of distant parishioners.

With the decline in the numbers of people seeking ordination, in some countries
parishes are now being merged together or are all sharing the services of one
priest in a phenomenon known in the United States as clustering.

In the Catholic Church there also exists a special type of ecclesiastical parish
called a national parish, which is not territorial in nature. These are usually
created to serve the needs of all of the members of a particular language group,
particularly of an immigrant community, in a large area  its members are not
defined by where they live, but by their country of origin or native language.

Other variations are also possible. In some Catholic jurisdictions created for
the armed forces, for instance, the entire diocese or archdiocese is treated as
a single parish  all of the Catholics in the military of the United States and
all of their Catholic dependents, for instance, form the Archdiocese of the
Military Services, USA, a diocese defined not by territory but by another
quality  in this case, relationship to the military    this archdiocese has its
own archbishop, and all records and other matters are handled in a central
office rather than by individual priests assigned to military post chapels or
chaplains of units in the field.

Church of England Many Church of England parishes that existed at the beginning
of the 19th century, owe their existence to the establishment of estate churches
by Anglo Saxon or Norman landowners. ref NJG Pounds, A History of the English
Parish,  CUP, 2000   ref  The parish as a territorial unit survived the
reformation largely untouched. Consequently, the 19th century parish boundary
often corresponds to that of an Anglo Saxon estate.

In the Church of England, part of the Anglican Communion, the legal right to
appoint or recommend a parish priest is called an advowson, and its possessor is
known as a patron. The patron can be an individual, the Crown, a bishop, a
college, a charity, or a religious body. Appointment as a parish priest entails
the enjoyment of a benefice. Appointment of patrons is now governed by the
Patronage  Benefices  Rules 1987. In mediaeval times and earlier, when the
church was politically and economically powerful, such a right could have great
importance. An example can be seen in the article on Grendon, Northamptonshire.
It was frequently used to promote particular religious views. For example Robert
Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick presented many puritan clergy. In the 19th century
Charles Simeon established a trust to purchase advowsons and install evangelical
priests. Ownership of an advowson now carries little personal advantage.

Rules 1987]  [http   www.churchcare.co.uk ncw_leaves_choose.php Process for
appointing a parish priest]

Even before the establishment of civil parishes, the Church of England parish
had become a unit of local government. For example, parishes were required to
operate the Elizabethan poor law.

Church of Scotland In the Church of Scotland, the parish is basic level of
church administration. The spiritual oversight of each parish church is
responsibility of the congregation s Kirk Session. Patronage was regulated this
way in 1712  Patronage Act  and abolished in 1843, ministers must be elected by
members of the congregation. Many parish churches are now  linked  with
neighbouring parish churches  served by a single minister.  With the abolition
of parishes as a unit of civil government in Scotland, parishes now have a
purely ecclesiastical significance in Scotland  and the boundaries may be
adjusted by the local Presbytery .
