[http   www.atu.edu  www.atu.edu]     Arkansas Tech University  is a mid sized,
state supported collegiate institution located in Russellville, Arkansas. The
university offers programs at both baccalaureate and graduate levels in a range
of fields. As of 2004, the University also operates a small satellite campus in
the town of Ozark, Arkansas. This campus primarily focuses on lower level
 Associates and Certificate  level education.

History Early History  1909 1976  The  Second District Agricultural School  was
created by Act 100 of 1909 of the Arkansas General Assembly It was decided on
February 10, 1910 to found the school in Russellville. On October 26, 1910, the
first classes were held in Russellville. The original purpose of the school was
to offer classes leading to a high school degree. Later on, the school took on
the first two years of college instruction, and the school s name was changed to
 Arkansas Polytechnic College  by the General Assembly in 1925 to reflect this
change in purpose. At this time, the course work leading to a high school
diploma was phased out and in 1931, Tech formally only offered courses leading
to a college degree.

Recent History  1976 Present  The school took on its current name of  Arkansas
Tech University  on July 9, 1976. During this time frame, what is considered the
most well known person to ever attend Arkansas Tech, Elizabeth Ward, attended
the university for a short time from 1980 until she was named Miss America.

In the fall of 2003, Arkansas Tech University announced it intended to overtake
the state vocational school, Arkansas Valley Technical Institute, in Ozark,
Arkansas. As of July 1, 2004, the Ozark campus has acted as a satellite campus
of Arkansas Tech, and has begun offering coursework leading toward an Associate
of Science degree in various subjects.

Alma Mater Alma Mater, Alma Mater,  br  May we lift our eyes to thee.  br  May
thy glory and thy honor  br  Be fore er our destiny.  br  May the colors Green
and Gold  br  Our loyal hearts fore er enthrall,  br  And thy mem ry live
forever,  br  In the hearts of us all. br 

Enrollment Enrollment has grown 36  since 1998. Thirty five states and 32
foreign countries are represented in the student body. Almost 10  of Tech s
incoming freshmen class graduated  1 or  2 in their high school class. Over 25 
of Tech s students graduated in the top 10  of their high school class. The
average ACT score of 2003 04 incoming freshmen was 22.
[http   atu.edu ProStudents abouttech.htm] The latest numbers from the 2006 fall
semester show that Arkansas Tech accepted only 48  of its applicants, making it
the most selective public institution in the state of Arkansas for the second
consecutive year.

Academic Programs   Faculty  25 new undergraduate and graduate programs added
since 1997  10 of the 12 academic areas eligible for national accreditation have
been accredited and the remaining are in process. Once this occurs, Tech will be
the only university in Arkansas to have all eligible programs accredited.  One
of only two ABET accredited Mechanical   Electrical Engineering programs in
Arkansas.  One of only three Emergency Administration   Management programs in
the United States.  Over 300 faculty members    45  tenured and over 68  hold
their doctorate or the highest degree awarded in the discipline.

construction, renovation   instructional equipment  New buildings and notable
renovation projects since 1997 include
