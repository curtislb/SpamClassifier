 Athletics , also known as  track and field  or  track and field athletics , is
a collection of sports events that involve running, throwing and jumping. The
name is derived from the Greek word  athlon  meaning  contest .

Some languages  e.g., German and Russian  refer to these sports as  light
athletics  to distinguish them from like weight lifting, wrestling, etc.

History

Athletics was the original event at the first Olympics in 775 BC where the only
event held was the stadium length foot race or  stade .

There were several other  Games  held throughout Europe in the classical era 
  Panhellenic Games    The [[Pythian Games]]  founded 527 BCE  held in Delphi
  every four years   The [[Nemean Games]]  founded 516 BCE  held in Argolid
  every two years   The [[Isthmian Games]]  founded 523 BCE  held on the Isthmus
  of Corinth every two years  The [[Roman Games]]     Arising from Etruscan
  rather than purely Greek roots, the Roman Games deemphasized footraces and
  throwing. Instead, the Greek sports of chariot racing and wrestling, as well
  as the Etruscan sport of gladiatorial combat, took center stage. Other peoples
  enjoyed athletic contests, such as the Celts, Teutons and Goths who succeeded
  the Romans. However, these were often related to combat training. In the
  Middle Ages the sons of noblemen would be trained in running, leaping and
  wrestling, in addition to riding, jousting and arms training. Contests between
  rivals and friends may have been common on both official and unofficial
  grounds.

In the 19th century the formal organisation of the modern events started. This
included the incorporation of regular sports and exercise into school regimes.
The Royal Military College, Sandhurst has claimed to be the first to adopt this
in 1812 and 1825 but without any supporting evidence. The earliest recorded
meeting was organised at Shrewsbury, Shropshire in 1840 by the Royal Shrewsbury
School Hunt. There are details of the meeting in a series of letters written 60
years later by C.T. Robinson who was a pupil there from 1838 to 1841. The Royal
Military Academy at Woolwich held an organised competition in 1949, but the
first regular series of meetings was held by Exeter College, Oxford from 1850.
 ref Oxford Companion to Sports and Games, ed. J.Arlott, O.U.P.  1975   ref 

Modern athletic events are usually organized around a 400m running track on
which most of the running events take place. Field events  vaulting, jumping,
and throwing  often take place inside the track.

Athletics was included in the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 and has formed
their backbone since. Women were first allowed to participate in track and field
events in the Olympics in 1928.

An international governing body, the IAAF was founded in 1912. The IAAF
established separate outdoor World Championships in 1983. Their are a number of
regional games as well, such as the European Championships, the Pan American
Games, and the Commonwealth Games. In addition their is a professional Golden
League circuit, cumulating in the IAAF World Athletics Final and indoor
championships such as the World Indoor Championships. The sport has a very high
profile during major championships, especially the Olympics, but otherwise is
less popular.

The AAU  Amateur Athletic Union  was the governing body in the United States
until it collapsed under pressure from advancing professionalism in the late
1970s. A new governing body called The Athletics Congress  TAC  was formed, it
was later renamed USA Track and Field  USATF or USA T F . An additional, less
structured organization, the Road Runners Club of America  RRCA  also exists in
the USA to promote road racing.

In modern times, athletes can now receive money for racing, putting an end to
the so called  shamateurism  that existed before.

Indoor track and field There are two seasons for track and field. There is an
indoor season, run during the winter and an outdoor season, run during the
spring and summer. Most indoor tracks are 200 meters, however, less frequently,
there are smaller and larger tracks that measure from between 120  13.3 laps to
a mile  to 300 meters. The typical indoor track consists of three to eight lanes
 usually six  instead of the six to ten  usually eight  on an outdoor track.
Often an indoor track will have banked turns to compensate for the tight bends.

In an indoor track meet athletes contest the same events as an outdoor meet with
the exception of the 100 m and 110 m 100 m hurdles  replaced by the 60 m sprint
and 60 m hurdles at most levels and sometimes the 55m sprint and 55m hurdles at
the high school level , and the 10,000 m run, 3,000m steeplechase, and 400m
hurdles. Indoor meets also have the addition of a 3,000 m run normall</STYLE>
