The  Western Meadowlark   Sturnella neglecta  is a medium sized blackbird, very
similar in appearance to the Eastern Meadowlark.

Adults have yellow underparts with a black  V  on the breast and white flanks
with black streaks. The upperparts are mainly brown with black streaks. They
have a long pointed bill  the head is striped with light brown and black.

Their breeding habitat is grasslands and prairie, also pastures and abandoned
fields, across western and central North America to northern Mexico. Where their
range overlaps with the eastern species, these birds prefer thinner, drier
vegetation  the two birds generally do not interbreed but do defend territory
against each other. The nest is on the ground, covered with a roof woven from
grasses. There may be more than one nesting female in a male s territory. The
nest is sometimes destroyed by mowing operations with eggs and young in them.

Western Meadowlark will interbreed with the Eastern Meadowlark where their
ranges overlap, though their offspring are infertile.

These birds are permanent residents throughout much of their range. Northern
birds migrate to the southern parts of the range  some birds also move east in
the southern United States.

These birds forage on the ground or in low to semi low vegetation, sometimes
probing with its bill. They mainly eat insects as well as seeds and berries. In
winter, they often feed in flocks.

This bird has a flute like warbled song, unlike the simple whistled call of the
Eastern Meadowlark. They were considered to be the same species for some time 
the western species, having been overlooked for some time, was given the species
name neglecta.

This is the state bird of Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oregon and
Wyoming.
