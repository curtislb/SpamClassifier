Dear Friend,
Karton Craft Company is a firm based in France. We produce and
distribute Craft works such as Metal Craft, Pottery, Ceramic and other  
artworks
worldwide. We have reached big sales volume of Craft Works in the
Europe and now are trying to penetrate the US market. Quite soon we will open
representative offices or authorized sales centers in the US .
Presently, Our company needs US representative/Assistance in Payment
Collections and in establishing a new distribution network there. The
fact is that despite the US market is new for us ,we already have regular
clients who are reacting positively to our products. We have made some  
supplies
to
the US.

But we have problems collecting money for the already supplied works.
The problem is that ; The international money transfer tax for legal
entities (companies) in France is 20%, whereas for the individual it is
only 4%. So my lawyer advice that instead of we making company
transfers, we should employ someone in the US that would work as our Financial
Coordinator. By so doing, we will only be paying 4% in tax. That's why
we need you! We need agents/representatives to receive payment for our
crafts( in money orders,check or bank wire transfers) from our clients
in the US ,and resend the money to us via Money Gram or Western Union
Money Transfer.


The work is simply you receiving payments from our Clients which will
be made cashable to you at your Bank. After cashing,the funds will be
transferred via Money Gram or Western Union Money Transfer according to our
instructions. As your income,you will be getting 10% of any amount
you collect and process. You will be deducting the income before funds
are transferred. You will be working as an Independent Contractor right from
your home
or office. This job wont interrupt your daily activities and its
absolutely legal. You can earn up to $3000 - 4000 monthly during the
time you will spend working with us. You do not need any capital to start. An
employee who make efforts and work hard have a strong possibility to
become managers when we commence our representative offices or authorized
sales centers in the US and you are assured of an excellent work
condition.

It's Legitimate Transactions between our Customers and our Company
Representatives and there is no legal risk.

I would be glad if you accept my proposal. Prospective finance
co-coordinator should forward the following info immediately:
1. Full Name:
2. Contact Phone
3. Full Physical Address:
4. Age & Sex
5. Nationality:
6. Occupation:
7. Any photo ID (If any)
8. Work experiences (If any)

Thank You!
Mark Aide
