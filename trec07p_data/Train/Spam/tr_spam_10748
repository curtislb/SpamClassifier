 Galway   official Irish name   Gaillimh   is the only city in the province of
Connacht in Ireland and capital of County Galway. The city is located on the
west coast of Ireland. In Irish, Galway is also called  Cathair na Gaillimhe ,
which is a translation of  City of Galway .

The city takes its name from the Gaillimh river  River Corrib  that formed the
western boundary of the earliest settlement, which was called D  n Bhun na
Gaillimhe, or the fort at the bottom of the Gaillimh. The word Gaillimh means
 stony  as in  stony river .  Alternative, more mythical, derivations are given
in [[History of Galway]] . The city also bears the nickname The City of the
Tribes, because fourteen ref name  fn_1  They were the merchant families of
Athy, Blake, Bodkin, Browne, Darcy, Deane, Font, Ffrench, Joyce, Kirwin, Lynch,
Martin, Morris, Skerrett.  ref   Tribes   merchant families  led the city in its
Hiberno Norman period. The term Tribes was originally a derogatory phrase from
Cromwellian times. The merchants would have seen themselves as English nobility,
and hence were loyal to the King. Their uncertain reaction to the siege of
Galway by Cromwellian forces earned them this label, which they subsequently
adopted in defiance. The city s nickanme is   The town of the tribes .

The population of the city was 71,983 at the most recent
[http   www.cso.ie census documents 2006_prelim_table01.pdf census] in April
2006, making it the third largest city in the Republic of Ireland, after Dublin
and Cork. The Galway urban area is sixth largest on the island of Ireland  after
Dublin, Belfast, Cork, Limerick and Derry .

History

 Mainguard Street.]]

D  n Bun na Gaillimhe   Fort at the Mouth  bottom  of the Gaillimh   was
constructed in 1124, by the King of Connacht Tairrdelbach mac Ruaidri Ua
Conchobair. A small settlement eventually grew up around this fort. During the
Norman invasion of Connacht in the 1230s, Galway fort was capturted by Richard
Mor de Burgh, who had led this invasion. As the de Burghs eventually became
gaelicised the merchants of the town pushed for greater control over the walled
city. This led to them gaining complete control over the city and the granting
of mayoral status by the English crown in December 1484. Galway endured
difficult relations with its Irish neighbours. A notice over the west gate of
the city, completed in 1562 by Mayor Thomas Oge Martyn fitz William, stated
 From the Ferocious O Flahertys may God protect us . A bye law forbade the
native Irish  as opposed to Galway s Hiberno Norman citizens  unrestricted
access into Galway, saying  neither O  nor Mac shall strutte nor swagger through
the streets of Galway  without permission. During the Middle Ages, Galway was
ruled by an oligarchy of fourteen ref name  fn_1     merchant families  12 of
Norman origin and 2 of Irish origin . These were the  tribes  of Galway. The
city throve on international trade. In</STYLE>
