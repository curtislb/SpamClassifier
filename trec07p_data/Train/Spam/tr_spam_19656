<p style="color:#FF0000; font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size:18px;"><b>ALERT: ALL STOCKS AT TRENDING123 SOLD!</b></p>
<p>The way the alarm bells sounded after I sent my alert last Friday, April 27, you&rsquo;d think it was the biggest calamity since hanging chads drove this country bonkers!</p>
<p>Okay, so if you aren&rsquo;t aware of it, yes, I did sell all of the <em>Trending123</em> portfolio stocks.&nbsp;  In all 34 stocks were sold &mdash; 26 of which took profits.&nbsp;  Take a look at the entire closed portfolio below:</p>

<div align="center"><img src="http://images.investorplace.com/e_images/jlhs/20070501/current_portfolio.jpg" width="400" height="438"></div>
<p>If this seems out of character to you, then you aren&rsquo;t well-acquainted with me yet.&nbsp;  I&rsquo;m a man of my word.&nbsp;  And I promised my <em>Trending123</em> subscribers 2 months ago that we were going to back test to new highs and when that happened, I would get everyone out.</p>

<p><b>Reverse Symmetrical Triangle</b></p>
<p>The Reverse Symmetrical Triangle (RST) may be the most difficult pattern you&rsquo;ll ever trade.&nbsp;  The reason for that is that to most traders, it seems there&rsquo;s no clear trend: prices makes both higher highs, which are usually bullish, and lower lows, which are usually bearish.&nbsp;  Because of this paradox, many traders get whipsawed by selling at the lows and buying at the highs.</p> 
<p>Fortunately, that&rsquo;s not what happens at <em>Trending123</em>.&nbsp;  Right now the charts are telling me that the market is headed for a correction.&nbsp;  And one glaring predictor of this upcoming decline is how many charts we are currently seeing this RST pattern in: 134!&nbsp;  What does this pattern look like?&nbsp;  Just like this:</p>

<div align="center"><img src="http://images.investorplace.com/e_images/jlhs/20070501/rstpattern.jpg" width="280" height="214" style="border:1px solid #333;"></div>
<p>Instead of panicking at the apparent senselessness of the pattern, I issued <b>buy</b> alerts at the <b>low</b> (D).&nbsp;  Since then, subscribers who followed my advice made money while the rest of the market was hiding out in the &ldquo;nut hut&rdquo; saying I must be crazy.&nbsp;  And just last week, I issued <b>sell</b> alerts at the <b>high</b> (E).&nbsp;  Again, they said I was crazy.&nbsp;  But let me ask you this: Why take the chance?</p>

<!--  End Take Note  -->
<p>Well it happened and I kept my promise.</p>
<p>You see, at the lows in early March I said we would rally up to make new highs as we back test the broken uptrend line.&nbsp;  At that time, I specifically stated that when we hit it I would issue across-the-board sell alerts.&nbsp;  Well guess what?&nbsp;  I did.</p>
<p>As of right now, Trending123.com has no open long positions.&nbsp;  And we won&rsquo;t until we see how this pattern plays out.&nbsp;  (See the sidebar to learn more about the RST pattern.)</p>

<p><b>The Fallout</b></p>
<p>Now let me tell you, I have been called every name in the book for doing this.&nbsp;  I have been questioned by everyone and their cousin for causing mass panic in our subscriber base.&nbsp;  I have even been blamed for the downfall of certain stocks on the Yahoo message board!</p>
<p>Well folks, I&rsquo;m not going to apologize. This is a Technical Analysis website.&nbsp;  My job is to call things the way I see it.</p>
<p>I have even received phone calls questioning my judgment and was asked if it wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;prudent&rdquo; to keep a few stocks in the suggested portfolio because after all &ldquo;being in cash&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t sell subscriptions.</p>
<p>To that I say&hellip;NO WAY!&nbsp;  I will not keep people in a market&mdash;in stocks that I suggested&mdash;when I see charts like the ones I am seeing right now.</p>

<p>I will not ignore what the charts are telling me.&nbsp;  I will not throw caution to the wind and keep people in stocks when I think a major correction is on the way.</p>
<p>My job as a technician is to call things the way I see it.&nbsp;  I am not your financial advisor.&nbsp;  But one thing I know do know very well is charts.</p>
<p>So if you want someone to call things the way they see it then you likely found the right place.</p>
<p>And the way I see things right now &mdash; well, you need to be cautious moving ahead in the market.&nbsp;  You could chance it.</p>
<p>Or you could make the safe bet. You could try out <em>Trending123</em>.&nbsp;  You could catch up on all things Technical Analysis.&nbsp;  You could go onto our message boards and talk to any of my current subscribers and see what kind of profits they have made from <em>Trending123</em>.</p>
