Privet, gentleman

I need someone to make the stars shine bright, to make the rainy
days be shorter and the sun shine every day in my heart. I need
someone to make me smile, someone who will respect and love me. I need
someone who will give me a hug when I'm feeling down. I need someone 
who will support me and love me. I need someone who will care, someone
who will share, someone who will always be near. I need someone who
will comfort me, someone who will cheer me on, and hold my hand
through nighttime, noon, and dawn. I need you! You can find me here 
and write me a letter: http://myhearthwithlove.com/likes

Looking forward to get a note from you
Yulianna K
