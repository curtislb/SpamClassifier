Dear  Sir/Madam,

customer and, an investment placed under our banks 
management 3 years ago, I contacted you independently 
of our investigation and no one is informed of this 
communication and I would like to intimate you with 
certain facts that I believe would be of interest to 
you.
  
As soon as i hear from you, i shall furnish you with 
more details about this transaction.
