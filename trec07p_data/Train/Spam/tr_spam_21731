Scholars debate about what exactly constitutes an  empire   from the Latin
 imperium , denoting military command within the ancient Roman government .
Generally, they may define an empire as a state that extends dominion over areas
and populations distinct culturally and ethnically from the culture ethnicity at
the center of power. Other definitions may emphasize economic or political
factors. The term generally implies military hegemonic power.

Like other states, an empire maintains its political structure at least partly
by coercion. Land based empires  such as the Mongol Empire or the Achaemenid
Persia  tend to extend in a contiguous area  sea borne empires, also known as
[[thalassocracy/thalassocracies]]  the Athenian, Portuguese and the British
empires provide examples , may feature looser structures and more scattered
territories.

Empires predate the Romans by several hundred years  Egypt, for example, set up
an empire in the 16th century BC by invading and then incorporating Nubia and
the ancient city states of the Levant. The Akkadian Empire of Sargon of Akkad
exists as one of the earliest models of a far flung, land based empire. Empire
contrasts with the example of a federation, where a large, multi ethnic state
    or even an ethnically one like Japan or a small area like Switzerland    
relies on mutual agreement amongst its component political units which retain a
high degree of autonomy. Additionally, one can compare physical empires with
potentially more abstract or less formally structured hegemonies in which the
sphere of influence of a single political unit  such as a city state  dominates
a culturally unified area politically or militarily. A second side of this same
coin shows in potentially inherent tactics of divide and conquer by different
factions   the enemy of my enemy is my friend   and central intervention for the
greater whole s benefit.

Compare also the concept of superpowers and hyperpowers.  Some commentators have
seen the British Empire as a hyperpower,  ref   To be sure, the United Kingdom
had a moment of  hyperpower  in the immediate aftermath of the Napoleonic
Wars...   Ferguson 2003    ref   ref   At the beginning of the 20th century, the
British Empire was an unopposed hyperpower.   Last 2005    ref  in its heyday as
the largest empire in world history  covering about one fourth of the Earth s
land surface  with established political, economical, financial, and scientific
hegemony over the whole world .

 within the Austro Hungarian Empire, from William R. Shepherd, Historical Atlas,
 1911  compare nation state.]]

Imperial systems What constitutes an empire is subject to wide debate and varied
definitions. An empire can be described as any state pursuing imperial policies,
can be defined traditionally, or can be examined as a political structure, for
example.

Alexander J. Motyl provides a theoretical framework for examining the structure
of empire. First, in an empire there must be a [[Core countries/core]] and a
[[periphery]]. The empire s structure relates the core [[elite]] to the
peripheral elite in a mutually beneficial fashion. Such a relationship can be
established through any number of means  aggressive, coercive, or consensual.
And while there is a vertical relationship between the core and periphery, there
is a lack of substantive relations between periphery and periphery. ref

 / and Revival of Empires origyear   2001 publisher   Columbia University Press
 / location   New York id   ISBN 0 231 12110 5 pages   pp. 13, 19 21, 32 36
    ref  This relationship he describes as an incomplete wheel  there are hubs
and spokes, but no rim.

Motyl describes three types of imperial structures  continuous, discontinuous,
and hybrid. In a continuous empire, all the territories are adjacent to one
another on land. ref name  motyl     The Mongol Empire, Russian Empire, Aztec
Empire, and Akkadian Empire are examples of such continuous empires. A
discontinuous empire is one in which the ruled territories are overseas or are
exclaves far from the imperial core. Maritime empires, such as the European
colonial empires, are examples of discontinuous empire. ref name  motyl     A
hybrid empire had both adjacent ruled territories and far flung ruled
territories. An example might be the German Reich, which had imperial
possessions in Europe as well as overseas in Africa. ref name  motyl    

Motyl also posits varying degrees of empire  formal, informal, and hegemonic. In
a formal imperial relationship, the core can appoint and dismiss peripheral
elites, obviate any exter</STYLE>
