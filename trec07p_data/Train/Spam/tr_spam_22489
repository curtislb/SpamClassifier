        Dear Reader,

        With venues like eBay.com (Nasdaq:EBAY), Yahoo
        (Nasdaq:YHOO) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) providing
        enormous bastions of consumers, emergent brands are
        finding these marketplaces critical as both a testing
        arena and a potential revenue source.

        Even beverage makers like Sweet Success Enterprises,
        Inc. (OTCBB:SWTS) have embraced the online shopping
        portals, looking to create new markets for their
        diverse line of nutritional ‘Fuel for Health’
        beverages.  In fact, Sweet Success announced late last
        week that that all of the six Fuel for Health(tm)
        products stocked at Amazon.com sold out. That news was
        followed by nearly 1.4 million shares of volume and 10%
        rise in the company’s share price.

        Clearly, the Amazon sell-out is another positive step
        for Sweet Success which acquired Nestle's original
        Sweet Success brand in 2002 and has re-launched a
        product line to tap into the rapidly growing demand for
        convenient and nutritious functional beverages.

        The Fuel for Health(tm) all-natural beverages line is
        available in a growing number of stores and includes
        select ingredients to satiate, boost energy and
        immunity and enhance a healthy lifestyle. See the
        company's web site at http://www.sweetsuccess.com for
        more information on the products and to order

        fast-growing natural and wellness beverage market is
        now approaching $25 billion.

        San Antonio-based Sweet Success Enterprises Inc.
        acquired Nestlé’s original Sweet Success™ brand and has
        re-launched as Fuel for Health™; an all natural product
        line to tap into the rapidly growing demand for all
        natural and self stable health and wellness beverages.

        SWTS produces have been formulated and reformulated,
        test-marketed, and repositioned in their market space
        for consumers. The work is done and now SWTS is rolling

        Health™ beverages are coming to market at the right
        time; when the demand is high.

        been shown to improve heart health, lower cholesterol
        and help prevent arthritis.

        Aktivated Barley - A pre-sprouted grain that digests

        The complete line of the seven Fuel for Health
        beverages will be merchandised in Sweet Success coolers
        in select H-E-B Healthy Living stores plus placement on
        the shelf in other Healthy Living stores throughout the
        state. ``A part of our sales and distributions goals is
        to enter accounts we have targeted since we began beta
        testing our products through regional markets in 2005,"
        said William Gallagher, Sweet Success' Chairman and
        CEO. "We are thrilled that we have attained cooler
        space in H-E-B's Healthy Living stores."

        The coolers, which display all seven healthy beverages
        through a glass door, will be prominently placed in the
        high-end stores. While Sweet Success beverages are
        shelf stable, cooler placement will facilitate
        immediate consumption due to impulse buying. Each
        cooler will contain consumer information on functional
        ingredients, benefits and nutritional facts. Shortly
        after cooler placement, Sweet Success will conduct
        in-store demos to allow consumers to sample the all
        natural functional beverage line.

        Sweet Success healthy-lifestyle beverages will be
        delivered to the H-E-B stores by Kehe Food
        Distributors. The Company recently announced an
        agreement whereby the national distributor will carry
        all seven Fuel for Health products.

        San Antonio-based Sweet Success Enterprises, Inc.
        acquired Nestle's original Sweet Success(tm) brand in
        2002 and has re-launched a product line to tap into the
        rapidly growing demand for convenient and nutritious
        functional beverages. Its line of Fuel for Health(tm)
        all-natural beverages is available in a growing number
        of stores and includes select ingredients to satiate,
        boost energy and immunity and enhance a healthy
        lifestyle.

<p>Dear Reader,
<p><font color="#000000">With venues like eBay.com (Nasdaq:EBAY), Yahoo
(Nasdaq:YHOO) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) providing enormous bastions of consumers,
emergent brands are finding these marketplaces critical as both a testing
arena and a potential revenue source.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Even beverage makers like <b>Sweet Success Enterprises,
Inc. (OTCBB:SWTS)</b> have embraced the online shopping portals, looking
to create new markets for their diverse line of nutritional ‘Fuel for Health’
beverages.&nbsp; In fact, Sweet Success announced late last week that that
all of the six Fuel for Health(tm) products stocked at Amazon.com sold
out. That news was followed by nearly 1.4 million shares of volume and
10% rise in the company’s share price.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Clearly, the Amazon sell-out is another positive
step for Sweet Success which acquired Nestle's original Sweet Success brand
in 2002 and has re-launched a product line to tap into the rapidly growing
demand for convenient and nutritious functional beverages.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#000000">The </font><b><font color="#000099">Fuel for Health(tm)</font></b><font color="#000000">
all-natural beverages line is available in a growing number of stores and
includes select ingredients to satiate, boost energy and immunity and enhance
a healthy lifestyle. See the company's web site at <a href="http://www.sweetsuccess.com">http://www.sweetsuccess.com</a>
