University   Afrikaans  Universiteit van Stellenbosch  is an internationally
recognised university which is situated in the town of Stellenbosch, South
Africa. Other nearby universities are the University of Cape Town and University
of the Western Cape.

Stellenbosch University designed and manufactured Africa s first microsatellite,
SUNSAT, launched in 1999.

Students are also nicknamed Maties. Some claim the term arises from their maroon
rugby colors  a tamatie is the Afrikaans translation for tomato. It is more
likely to come from the Afrikaans colloquialism matie  meaning  buddy  or
 mate   originally used diminutively by the students of the University of Cape
Town s precursor, the South African College.

History

The origin of the university can be traced back to the  Stellenbosch Gymnasium ,
which was opened on 1 March 1866 , which became the  Stellenbosch College  in
1881 and which was located at the current Arts Department. In 1887 this college
was renamed  [[Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom / Victoria]] College   when it
acquired university status on 2 April 1918 it was renamed once again   to
 Stellenbosch University .

Location


Stellenbosch is a university town with a population of about 90,000  excluding
students . It is located about 50 kilometres from Cape Town and is situated on
the banks of the Eerste Rivier   First River   in the famous wine growing region
and is encircled by picturesque mountains. Teaching at Stellenbosch University
is divided between the main Stellenbosch campus, the Tygerberg campus, where the
Faculty of Health Sciences is situated, the Bellville Park campus, where the
graduate School of Business is, and the Saldanha campus, housing the Faculty of
Military Science.

Language

Stellenbosch University is a predominantly Afrikaans medium university,
especially at undergraduate and honours course level. However, students are
allowed to write their assignments, tests and examinations in English.

At postgraduate level the language of tuition is determined by the composition
of the class. The majority of advanced postgraduate courses are conducted in
English.

This is still an ongoing issue for the University, since it is one of the very
few tertiary institutions left in South Africa offering tuition in Afrikaans, as
well as the very high regard it is held in the Afrikaner community, with the
university being considered a central pillar of Afrikaner life. Most other
institutions have always been English or have changed over to an English only
policy.

Faculties and schools

Stellenbosch University consists of about 150 departments divided amongst 10
faculties. It also has more than 40 research  and other  institutions.

The faculties that are situated on the main campus are
