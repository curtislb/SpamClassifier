 Lewis   Le  dhas in Scottish Gaelic  or  The Isle of Lewis   Eilean Le  dhais ,
is the northern part of the largest island of the Western Isles of Scotland or
Outer Hebrides  Na h Eileanan Siar . The southern part of the island is called
Harris  Na Hearadh . The two names however refer to the two parts of the same
island despite the use of the terms  Isle of Lewis  and  Isle of Harris . Lewis
is, in general, the lower lying part of this island, with Harris being more
mountainous.

Lewis  main settlement, the only burgh on the Outer Hebrides, is Stornoway
 Ste  rnabhagh , from which ferries sail to Ullapool on the Scottish mainland.
In the 2001 census Lewis had a usually resident population of 16,872. In
Scotland s former counties, Lewis was part of Ross shire  Ross and Cromarty .

Both Gaelic and English are spoken in Lewis, but in day to day life, a hybrid of
English and Gaelic  Highland English  is very common [http   www.linguae 
celticae.org dateien Gaidhlig_Local_Studies_Vol_15_Steornabhagh_Ed_II.pdf]. As a
result of the Gaelic influence, the Lewis accent is frequently considered to
sound more Irish, Welsh and even North American than stereotypically Scottish in
some quarters.

The island s settlements are on or near the coasts or sea lochs, being
particularly concentrated on the north east coast. The interior of the island is
a large area of moorland from which peat was traditionally cut as fuel, although
this practice has become rarer. The southern part of the island, adjoining
Harris, is more mountainous with inland lochs. The island of Bernera  Great
Bernera  in the district of Uig is linked to the mainland of Lewis by a bridge
opened in 1953.

The main industries are fishing, tourism, crafts  including the manufacture of
Harris tweed , and crofting. Religion is important in Lewis, with much of the
population belonging to the Free Church and Church of Scotland  both
Presbyterian in tradition . The Sabbath  i.e., Sunday  is generally observed
with most shops and licensed premises closed on that day, although there is a
scheduled air service to mainland Scotland.

Attractions on the island include the Callanish standing stones, the Clach an
Truiseil monolith, the thirteenth century Teampull Mholuaidh church, the Butt of
Lewis cliffs and lighthouse and the broch at Dun Carloway. The Lewis chessmen
were found on the island in 1831.

Most of the place names in Lewis and Harris come from Old Norse. The name Lewis
is the English spelling of the Gaelic Le  dhas which comes from the Old Norse
Lj    h  s, as Lewis is named in medieval Norwegian maps of the island.
Lj    h  s translates from Old Norse to English as Home of the Poet  Lj      
Poet, h  s   house . The 12th century ruler of the Island, Leod, taking his name
from the Norse word for Poet.

In 1919 the Isle of Lewis suffered a terrible blow with the sinking of the
  Iolaire  , when at the close of the First World War the Admiralty yacht HMY
Iolaire, sank within sight of Stornoway s harbour, killing over 200 naval
reservists from the island who were returning home after the war.
