    Charlotte Bront        April 21, 1816  ndash  March 31, 1855  was an English
novelist and the eldest of the three Bront   sisters whose novels have become
enduring classics of English literature.

 Life  Charlotte Bront   was born at Thornton, in Yorkshire, England, the fifth
of six children, to Patrick Bront    formerly  Patrick Brunty  , an Irish
Anglican clergyman, and his wife, Maria Branwell. In April 1820 the family moved
to Haworth, where Patrick had been appointed Perpetual Curate. Maria Branwell
Bront   died of cancer on 15 September 1821, leaving five daughters and a son to
the care of her sister Elizabeth Branwell. In August 1824, Charlotte was sent
with three of her sisters, Emily, Maria, and Elizabeth, to the Clergy Daughters 
School at Cowan Bridge in Lancashire  which she would describe as Lowood School
in Jane Eyre . Its poor conditions, Charlotte maintained, permanently affected
her health and physical development, and hastened the deaths of her two elder
sisters, Maria  born 1815  and Elizabeth  born 1814 , who died of tuberculosis
in 1825 soon after they were removed from the school.

At home in Haworth Parsonage, Charlotte and the other surviving children  mdash 
Branwell, Emily, and Anne  mdash  began chronicling the lives and struggles of
the inhabitants of their imaginary kingdoms. Charlotte and Branwell wrote
stories about their country  mdash  Angria  mdash  and Emily and Anne wrote
articles and poems about theirs  mdash  Gondal. The sagas were elaborate and
convoluted  and still exist in part manuscripts  and provided them with an
obsessive interest in childhood and early adolescence, which prepared them for
their literary vocations in adulthood.

Charlotte continued her education at Roe Head school in Mirfield from 1831 to
1832, where she met her lifelong friends and correspondents, Ellen Nussey and
Mary Taylor. During this period  1833  she wrote her novella [[The Green Dwarf]]
under the name of Wellesley. Charlotte returned as a teacher from 1835 to 1838.
In 1839 she took up the first of many positions as governess to various families
in Yorkshire, a career she pursued until 1841. In 1842 she and Emily travelled
to Brussels to enroll in a pensionnat run by Constantin Heger  1809 ndash 1896 
and his wife Claire Zo   Parent Heger  1804 ndash 1890 . In return for board and
tuition, Charlotte taught English and Emily taught music. Their time at the
pensionnat was cut short when Elizabeth Branwell, their aunt who joined the
family after the death of their mother to look after the children, died of
internal obstruction in October 1842. Charlotte returned alone to Brussels in
January 1843 to take up a teaching post at the pensionnat. Her second stay at
the pensionnat was not a happy one  she became lonely, homesick, and deeply
attached to Constantin Heger. She finally returned to Haworth in January 1844
and later used her time at the pensionnat as the inspiration for some of [[The
Professor  novel /The Professor]] and [[Villette  novel /Villette]].

In May 1846, Charlotte, Emily, and Anne published a joint collection of poetry
under the assumed names of Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell. Although the book
failed to attract interest  only two copies were sold  the sisters decided to
continue writing for publication and began work on their first novels. Charlotte
continued to use the name  Currer Bell  when she published her first two novels.


Her novels were deemed coarse by the critics. Much speculation took place as to
who Currer Bell really was, and whether Bell was a man or a woman.

Charlotte s brother, Branwell, the only son of the family, died of chronic
bronchitis and marasmus exacerbated by heavy drinking, in September 1848,
although Charlotte believed his death was due to tuberculosis. Emily and Anne
both died of pulmonary tuberculosis in December 1848 and May 1849, respectively.



Charlotte and her father were now left alone. In view of the enormous success of
Jane Eyre, she was persuaded by her publisher to visit London occasionally,
where she revealed her true identity and began to move in a more exalted social
circle, becoming friends with Harriet Martineau, Elizabeth Gaskell, William
Makepeace Thackeray and G. H. Lewes. However, she never left Haworth for more
than a few weeks at a time as she did not want to leave her aging father s side.

In June 1854, Charlotte married Arthur Bell Nicholls, her father s curate. She
died nine months later during her first pregnancy. Her death certificate gives
the cause of death as phthisis  tuberculosis , but there is a school of thought
that suggests she may have died from her excessive vomiting caused by severe
morning sickness in the early stages of pregnancy. There is also evidence to
suggest that Charlotte died from typhus she may have caught from Tabitha
Ackroyd, the Bront   household s oldest servant, who died shortly before her.
Charlotte was interred in the family vault in The Church of St. Michael and All
Angels, Haworth, West Yorkshire, England.
