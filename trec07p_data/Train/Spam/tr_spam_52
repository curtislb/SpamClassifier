 This article refers to the sporting contest. For the sports store chain of the
same name see [[Decathlon Group]]. For the aircraft see [[8KCAB Decathlon]]. For
the American academic competition see [[Academic Decathlon]]

 Decathlon  is an athletic event combining 10 track and field events. Events are
held over two consecuative days and the winners are determined by the combined
performance in all events. Performance is judged on a points system in each
event, not by the position achieved. The decathlon is contested by male
athletes, while female athletes contest the Heptathlon.

The decathlon is a menu of athletic events, testing an individual   s speed,
endurance, strength, skill, and personality. The word is of Greek origin  deka
[ten] +athlon [contest] . The decathlon includes five events on each of 2
successive days. The first day schedules the 100 meter run, long jump, shot put,
high jump, and 400 meters. It is a day of speed, explosive power, and jumping
ability. Day 2 consists of the 110 meter hurdles, discus, pole vault, javelin,
and 1500 meters. The importance of this day is on technique and endurance.

Events Day 1 

      100 m
      long jump
      Shot put
      high jump
      400 m

Day 2 

      110m hurdles
      discus throw
      pole vault
      javelin throw
      1500 m

Origins The event sprouted from the ancient game pentathlon. Pentathlon is a
game that was played at the ancient Greek Olympics. Pentathlons involved five
games     long jump, discus throw, javelin, sprint and a wrestling match.
Introduced in Olympia during 708 BC, the game was extremely popular for many
centuries. By the 6th century BC, pentathlons became part of religious games.

Gorgos, from Elis town near Olympia was a four time pentathlon winner during the
period. Another key player was Lampis, a young Spartan who was the first Olympic
winner. Automedes was also a known player of the time. The last recorded game
winner was Publius Asklepiades of Corinth in AD 241. Roman Emperor Theodosius I
officially put an end to the game in AD 393 by closing down all the sanctuaries
including Olympia.

>From the mid 1700s various versions of the game emerged. The 1948 Olympics
endorsed a new implication to the game. Seventeen year old Mathias emerged as
the then decathlon winner, banishing the myth that decathlon was a game for the
old and the experienced. Mathias still remains the youngest decathlon sports
champion in Olympic history.

Modern standardization In 1964 the International Amateur Athletic Federation
 IAAF  laid out new scoring tables and brought about some standardization in the
game. The 1970s saw the game spreading to the Eastern European nations, mainly
the Soviet Union, Poland and East Germany.

To ancient Greeks and modern Germans, the decathlon performer was and is the
king of athletes. But to most of the track world, including the United States,
the decathlete is a sometime hero, recognized and applauded only when he wins
the Olympic Games. Hero or forgotten man, the 10 event performer is a rare and
unique breed.

The first decathlon competition was held on a single day, October 15, 1911, in
Gothenburg, Sweden. This was technically not the first decathlon, but one of the
first two, as Germany also held a decathlon on the very same day. The Germans
contested their events in the same order but with a different scoring table. So,
the first decathlon world record holder was the winner of the first completed
meet. Karl Hugo Wieslander, a Swede, and Karl Ritter von Halt, a German, were
announced world record holders.

The decathlon was added to the 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm. After
experience, the following order was chosen  100m run, long jump, shot put, high
jump, and 400m run on the first day  110m hurdles, discus, pole vault, javelin,
and 1500m run on the 2nd day. The Swedes also developed a set of scoring tables,
based on the 1908 Olympic records. After the 1912 Stockholm Games, the tables
were updated to include many new Olympic records.

The 1912 Olympic decathlon has become legend because of the presence of Jim
Thorpe. Jim had a terrific 1912 spring track season, winning as many as six
events per meet. Thorpe made the U.S. Olympic team in four events  decathlon,
pentathlon, high jump, and long jump. The Russian czar donated a Viking ship as
a prize for the decathlon champion. Thorpe won the decathlon by almost 700
points over his closet opponent, Hugo Wieslander of Sweden. Because of the
unexpected large number of entries, the decathlon was held over 3 days. The
first day they held the 100m run, long jump, and shot put. The second day
consisted of the high jump, 400m run, discus, and 110, hurdles. The third and
final day consisted of the pole vault, javelin, and 1500 m run. Thorpe   s 8412
points converts to 6564 points on the current tables, still a very respectable
score three quarters of a century later. Swedes  Hugo Wieslander, Charles
Lomberg, and G  sta Holm  r captured the next three spots.

Thorpe   s score was not beaten for another 15 years. In his absence, there was
little decathlon activity for the remainder of the decade. Only in Sweden was
the decathlon often contested. The Swedes managed to stay neutral during World
War I, which forced the cancellation of the games of Berlin in 1916.
Fascinatingly, decathlons were held as part of the Far Eastern Games in 1913,
1915, 1917, and 1919.

The average good decathlete competes at most three or four times a year, the
less talented even fewer. Bill Toomey   s nine great efforts back in 1969 were
very unusual. The Decathlon is the least common Olympic event.

The decathlete does not have to be amazing in any event to be a champion in the
10 events. But he must range from adequate in his weak events to good or better
in the other skills. Because he must do well in the four runs and six field
events, he has little opportunity to perfect any one event. His training is
necessarily different as he strives to improve all techniques, gai</STYLE>
