Hi, my dear friend

It is not easy to write the first letter to man I have never seen. I have 
been thinking a lot before I made this first step and I hope you accept it 
and support me.
I have read your profile and found a lot of common between us. I like 
traveling, swimming, walking along the sea shore, theatre. I am cheerful and 
energy, well balanced and flexible person.  I don't have too many dislikes. 
What I don't want to do, I don't do.  I seldom have contact with people that 
carry around too many dislikes. If there is hope to remedy them, I tell 
them. People fail in life most because they don't say what they really want. 
And this is the reason why they accumulate dislikes. What do I like? Some of 
it you have already learned from my profile: I like my life, my job, and the 
way I've developed as a person over the years.
I think it is not polite to start all sentences from "I" or "I am". I would 
like to hear something about you. Tell me more about yourself. I am here to 
meet my beloved and special ONE.  I wish him to understand my inner world 
and to share his rich inner world.
Today I had felt the smell of spring outside and I believe hot sunny summer 
will come soon though the streets are full of snow. My dreams about YOU are 
realistic as well. I hope to get letter from you 
at http://flirtwithmedirect.com/sweetkiss to start our 
communication and will be pleased to answer your questions you may have. 


Waiting for your response

Anastasya
