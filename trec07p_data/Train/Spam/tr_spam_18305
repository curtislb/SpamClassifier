That also led to Howard talking to Artie about his work schedule and how
he could work in some working out even when he's doing the stand-up
thing around the country. Artie wondered how many he could actually do
so Howard told him to go give it a try.
He then went off on Double A saying that not everyone gets an
inheritance like he did so not everyone can go out like he does. Howard
read another one from a guy who was upset with the way he made Mutt take
down the pictures he had taken at his private party. She knew who was on
the phone and didn't want to talk to him at all. She said that Artie had
nailed it when he said J-Date. Jon Hein said that they'd be talking
about that and about Bubba's ''black voice'' today.
Howard asked JD if he wanted to hear another clip of his girl in a porn.
then he'd beg for her not to tell his boss, but she would tell his boss
and he'd get fired and go to jail. Howard mentioned that JD is part of a
football game that they're going to be playing during the Super Bowl
half time. Howard said that Mutt can do whatever he wants but he
shouldn't have posted those pictures from a private party.
Lisa said that he ripped off  a radio there. Howard asked JD what's
wrong with him because nothing seems to make him happy.
He said they'll be talking to Kimberly Kane about her weekend with JD.
Howard said that the greatest story in the paper is about this psychic
Sylvia Browne.
The guys talked about how disturbing Carrot Top looked in the video.
At the time the guy bought 150 acres and kept 50 acres for himself. JD's
father told some stories about his son and Artie shared some stories
about his own life.
Howard's Noisy Heating System Keeping Him Awake.
Howard told Bob that he could stick around during the Steve Langford and
Jon Hein updates if he wanted. Howard said that guy will do anything.
Howard said that a bunch of people got together to fight the possible
merger of XM and SIRIUS.
He wondered how JD did in the game.
Howard asked how Lisa met this guy. He said Montel should throw that
woman off his show. One person wrote in and said that JD really should
have his own show.
He said the lawyer who handled his business had bought the land from
some other guy. Howard said that Larry Flynt is tough to listen to.
Howard said we have the most gullible people in this country. Howard
played some more clips of JD's girlfriend getting fucked as he was
getting ready to go to break.
Howard told him he should do the whole Wrap-Up Show in his black voice.
That led to Artie asking Howard about his run with Beth and what kind of
food he was eating. Howard told JD he sees why he's so messed up after
hearing the Wrap-Up Show.
