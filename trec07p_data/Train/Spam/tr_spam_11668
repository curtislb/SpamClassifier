<center> <body bgcolor=3D=22=23ffffff=22> <=21--Young people and faculty members car=
ried out some of the wounded themselves, without waiting for ambulances to arrive. Many fo=
und themselves trapped behind chained and padlocked doors. SWAT team members with helmet=
s, flak jackets and assault rifles swarmed over the campus. A student used his cell-phone c=
amera to record the sound of bullets echoing through a stone building.

Trey Perkins, who was sitting in a German class in Norris Hall, told The Washington Post tha=
t the gunman barged into the room at about 9:50 a.m. and opened fire for about a minute and a ha=
lf, squeezing off about 30 shots.=20

The gunman first shot the professor in the head and then fired on the students, Perkins said=
=2E The gunman was about 19 years old and had a =22very serious but very calm look on his face,=
=22 he said.=20

=22Everyone hit the floor at that moment,=22 said Perkins, 20, of Yorktown, Va., a sophomo=
re studying mechanical engineering. =22And the shots seemed like it lasted forever.=

Erin Sheehan, who was also in the German class, told the student newspaper, the Collegiate=
 Times, that she was one of only four of about two dozen people in the class to walk out of the ro=
om. The rest were dead or wounded, she said.=20

She said the gunman =22was just a normal-looking kid, Asian, but he had on a Boy Scout-type o=
utfit. He wore a tan button-up vest, and this black vest, maybe it was for ammo or something.=
