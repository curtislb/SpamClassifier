The  meerkat  or  suricate  Suricata suricatta is a small mammal and a member of
the mongoose family. It inhabits all parts of the Kalahari Desert in southern
Africa. A group of meerkats is called a  mob  or  gang .

Name  Meerkat  is an English loan word from Afrikaans. The name came from Dutch
but by misidentification. Dutch meerkat and German Meerkatze mean  guenon , a
monkey of the [[Cercopithecus]] genus. The word  meerkat  looks like Dutch for
 lake cat , but neither suricatas nor guenons are attracted to lakes  the word
possibly started as a Dutch adaptation of a derivative of Sanskrit marka  a
                   monkey , perhaps in Africa via an Indian sailor onboard a
Dutch East India Company ship. The traders of the Dutch East India Company were
likely familiar with monkeys, but the Dutch settlers attached the name to the
wrong animal at the Cape. The suricata is called stokstaartje    little stick 
tail  in Dutch and Erdm  nnchen    little earth man  in German.

According to African popular belief  mainly in the Zambian Zimbabwean region ,
the meerkat is also known as the  sun angel , as it protects villages from the
 moon devil  or the werewolf which is believed to attack stray cattle or lone
tribesmen.

Anatomy

The meerkat is a small diurnal herpestid  mongoose  weighing on average about
731 grams  1.61 pounds  for males and 720 grams  1.58 pounds  for females. Its
long slender body and limbs give it a body length of 25 to 35 cm  10 to 14
inches  and an added tail length of 17 to 25 cm  7 to 10 inches . Its tail is
not bushy like all other mongoose species, but is rather long and thin and
tapers to a black or reddish coloured pointed tip. The meerkat uses its tail to
balance when standing upright. Its face tapers, coming to a point at the nose,
which is brown. The eyes always have black patches around them, which help
deflect the sun s glare. The meerkat has small black crescent shaped ears that
can close when digging to keep sand out. Like cats, meerkats have binocular
vision, a large peripheral range, depth perception, and eyes on the front of
their faces.

At the end of each of a meerkat s  fingers  is a non retractable, strong, 2 cm
 .8 inches  long, curved claw used for digging their underground burrows and
digging for prey. Claws are also used with muscular hindlegs to help them climb
the occasional tree. They have four toes on each foot and long slender limbs.
The coat is usually fawn coloured peppered with gray, tan, or brown with a
silver tint. They have short parallel stripes across their backs, extending from
the base of the tail to the shoulders. The patterns of stripes are unique to
each meerkat. The underside of the meerkat has no markings but the belly has a
patch which is only sparsely covered with hair and shows the black skin
underneath. The meerkat uses this area to absorb heat standing on its rear legs,
usually early in the morning after cold desert nights.

Diet and foraging behaviour Meerkats are primarily insectivores, but also eat
lizards, snakes, spiders, plants, eggs and small mammals. Like all mongoose
species, they are immune to many venoms, and eat scorpions  including the
stinger  and some snakes, without fear of illness, poison or death. They have no
excess body fat stores, so foraging for food is a daily need.

Reproduction ]] Meerkats become sexually mature at about one year of age and
have, on average, three young per litter. Wild meerkats have up to three litters
