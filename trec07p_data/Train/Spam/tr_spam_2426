          <h2 align="center">FOUR  WORDS</h2>
          <p>My wish for you is a long and  prosperous life, but when you confront your final days, surrounded I trust by  your adoring family and a multitude of friends, I hope you will take your  youngest grandchild or great grandchild&mdash;a clever little prot&eacute;g&eacute;, no doubt&mdash;and  whisper 4 words into that shell-like ear before you go to your eternal reward.</p>
          
          <p>Those are the 4 words that made you  wealthy.</p>
          
          <p>Those same 4 words will ring in  your grandchild&rsquo;s ears for years, as your magnificent legacy is spent on  expensive schools and powerful automobiles.&nbsp; But because this child loves and misses you, he or she will sometimes  visit your grave, where (just in case) those same 4 words can be read, chiseled  at your instructions in rather large type, right into your marble headstone.</p>
          
          <p>One day, your legacy gone and that  child an adult, he or she will use those 4 words to build a NEW legacy, even  richer and more magnificent than yours.&nbsp; </p>
          
          <p>And you will look down (I hope  down, not up!) and approve.&nbsp; </p>
          
          <p>Your work will be complete.</p>
          
          <p>Here Are Those 4 Words:</p>
          <p>They are simple-deceptively simple.</p>
          
          <p>They call for you to understand  that China&rsquo;s rise is the most significant economic and social event of our  era&mdash;and one RIFE with investment opportunities.</p>
          
          <p>They call for you to grasp that  China&rsquo;s rise is, first and foremost, an INDUSTRIAL surge.</p>
          
          <p>The scale of this industrialization  defies description.&nbsp; Groups of  American investors I have taken through China&rsquo;s rarely-visited industrial  hinterlands stand blinking in disbelief when they see, stretching as far as the  eye can see in the dust and haze, mills and factories and substations and  top-heavy trucks and a multitude of blackened faces&mdash;often of children.&nbsp; </p>
          
          <p>My American friends get back on the  tour bus and sit in silence for the next hour trying to assimilate what they  just witnessed.</p>
          
          <p>It is at the end of that hour of  stunned silence that I step to the bus microphone and say these 4 words:</p>
