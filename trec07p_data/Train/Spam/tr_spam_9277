/ [[Gadopsis]] species    G. marmoratus  binomial   Gadopsis marmoratus

The  river blackfish ,  Gadopsis marmoratus  is an Australian native freshwater
fish of the Murray Darling river system, found from southern Queensland through
to central Victoria. It is also found in some eastern and southern flowing
coastal rivers. Found primarily in upland and  midland  habitats, though early
records of fish fauna suggest it was originally far more extensively distributed
and was found in some lowland habitats as well. Originally, river blackfish co 
inhabited many of its lowland and  midland  habitats with species such as Murray
cod and golden perch, and its upland habitats with species such as trout cod and
Macquarie perch.

Description River blackfish are elongated with a rounded body, distinct snout
and large mouth, and small to moderate sized eyes. The caudal fin, soft dorsal
fin and anal fin are rounded. The spiny dorsal fin is low, weak and blends into
the soft dorsal fin. Colour varies but is usually either yellow or green with
dark green mottling, or a very dark purple black colour.

It is a carnivore that takes crayfish, shrimp, the occasional small fish and
occasional surface prey. It is strongly nocturnal.

Murray Darling river blackfish show a maximum size of around 30 nbsp cm and  
0.8 nbsp kg.

It is a highly underrated sportsfish, particularly the Southern form  see
below . It is fast and strong, and has been shown to take flies and lures, even
surface lures, in addition to the more usual worm baits.

Range and classification Endemic to south eastern Australia, river blackfish
like many Murray Darling native fishes have managed to cross the Great Dividing
Range via natural river capture events and so are found in south flowing coastal
rivers and streams in the eastern half of Victoria. These fish are now often
referred to as  southern river blackfish . This population shows a far great
maximum size of 60 nbsp cm or more and about 5.5 nbsp kg. Specimens this large
were likely to be very old     30 years or more     and are rarely seen now.
Logic suggests that due to these dramatic size differences, as well as isolation
from the parent Murray Darling species, genetic drift and natural selection,
southern river blackfish are separate species. The taxonomy has not been
reflected to update this.

River blackfish continue the trend present in Murray Darling native fish of
speciating into primarily lowland species and upland species, with the upland
species being in this case the two spined blackfish, Gadopsis bispinosus. The
two spined blackfish is a more specialised upland inhabitant, and is found in
the strongly flowing, cobble bottomed sub alpine rivers and streams of northeast
Victoria, southeast New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory.
Though with the blackfish species perhaps you would say the split is
lowland midland and upland as there are overlaps in their range, and river
blackfish are found in many upland habitats.

There are also indications that river blackfish populations in the southern and
northern halves of the Murray Darling river system may represent two distinct
species or sub species, with genetic and other differences.

The similarities between the [[Gadopsis]] blackfish and the [[Maccullochella]]
cods  such as the Murray cod, Maccullochella peelii  are striking. There are
some grounds for believing that Blackfish may be in effect a smaller version of
Murray cod, inhabiting similar niches to Murray cod but in habitats that are too
small for Murray cod  having said this, their distributions originally
overlapped substantially , and there are grounds for believing that blackfish
and Murray cod have drawn heavily on common genes at the family level. FishBase,
for instance, has scrapped the family Gadopsidae and listed the blackfishes as
members of the temperate perch family, Percichthyidae. A mitochondrial DNA study
has confirmed a relationship between the Blackfish and the Percichthyidae but
the exact relationship was not resolved in that study  Jerry et al., 2001 .
Further study is needed to resolve the relationship between the blackfish and
the Percichthyidae.

Blackfish have a recruitment method similar to Murray cod, but with more
specialisation to upland habitats. Blackfish spawn in spring and lay a very
limited number of large, adhesive eggs   1000  on sunken timber  snags , or in
the case of two spined blackfish on submerged rocks. Similar to Murray cod, the
male guards the eggs until they hatch. Upon hatching the larval blackfish are,
uniquely, attached to their ruptured egg case by a tether until the yolk sac is
largely used and the larvae are ready to commence exogenous feeding.  This
unique structure is presumably an adaptation to upland riv</STYLE>
