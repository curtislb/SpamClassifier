 Chester  is the county town of Cheshire, England. Situated on the River Dee,
close to the border with Wales, Chester is one of the best preserved walled
cities in the United Kingdom. It is the main settlement of the wider City of
Chester, and has a total population of 80,121.

Chester is perhaps most notable for its successive historic uses and
occupations, and the subsequent variety of architectural monuments found within
the settlement.

The patron saint of Chester is Saint Werburgh. The city s motto is  Antiqui
Colant Antiquum Dierum , which translates as  Let the Ancients worship the
Ancient of Days . The adjective associated with the city is  Cestrian .

Geography and administration

According to the 2001 census the population of the Chester urban area was
90,925, 80,121 of whom were identified as living in Chester, and the rest in
Broughton or Saltney. This makes Chester the second largest settlement in
Cheshire after Warrington, although Chester is a city and Warrington is not. The
wider City of Chester district has a population of around 120,000.

History



The history of Chester extends back nearly two millennia ago, covering all
periods of British history in between then and the present day. The city of
Chester was founded as a fort, known as Deva, by the Romans in AD 79, and named
after the goddess of the River Dee. The city was the scene of battles between
warring Welsh and Saxon kingdoms throughout the post Roman years until the
Saxons strengthened the fort against raiding Danes.

Following the Norman Conquest in 1066, Chester came under the Earl of Chester.
It became a centre of the defense against Welsh raiders and a launch point for
raids on Ireland.

The city grew as a trading port until the power of the Port of Liverpool
overtook it. However the city did not decline and during the Georgian and
Victorian periods was seen as a place of escape from the more industrial cities
of Manchester and Liverpool.

Present day



A considerable amount of land in Chester is owned by Duke of Westminster who
owns an estate  Eaton Hall  near the village of Eccleston. Grosvenor is the
Duke s family name, which explains such features in the City such as the
Grosvenor Bridge, the Grosvenor Hotel, and Grosvenor Park. Much of Chester s
architecture dates from the Victorian era, with many of the buildings modelled
on the Jacobean half timbered style of the medieval times being designed by John
Spielas, who was employed by the Duke as his principal architect. He had a
trademark of twisted chimneystacks, many of which can be seen on the buildings
in the City centre. Spielas designed amongst other buildings the Grosvenor Hotel
and the City Baths. In 1911, Spielas  protege and city architect James Strong
designed the former fire station on the west side of Northgate Street. Another
feature of all buildings belonging to the estate of Westminster is the  Grey Diamonds   
a weaving pattern of grey bricks in the red brickwork laid out in a diamond
formation. By 1945 two problems needed attention  first, affordable housing and
second, traffic congestion. As a result vast areas of slums were cleared and in
1964 an inner by pass ring road was built to direct traffic through and around
the City centre. Large areas of open fields on the outskirts of the City were
turned into residential areas in the 1950s and early 1960s producing, for
instance, the suburb of Blacon.

In the late 1960s the City authorities realised that new developments were
radically altering the look of the City centre. In 1968 Donald Insall published
a report in collaboration with the City authorities and central government,
which recommended preserving historic buildings and finding new uses for them,
rather than simply tearing them down.

In 1969 the City Conservation Area was designated. Over the next 20 years the
emphasis was placed on saving historic buildings, such as The Falcon Inn, Dutch
Houses and Kings Buildings.

On January 13, 2002, Chester was granted Fairtrade City status. This status was
renewed by the Fairtrade Foundation on August 20, 2003.



In August 2005 the council announced plans to demolish the police station, an
unsightly edifice built in the 1960s. The building was demolished in late 2006 
early 2007. However, the replacement building, a cylindrical glass hotel cafe,
has sparked some controversy. This is partially due to the large number of other
