 University of San Francisco    USF   is a private Jesuit and Catholic
University in San Francisco, California, United States. USF was established as
San Francisco s first institution of higher learning in 1855 and is ranked in
the Top 120 of more than 3,500 U. S. colleges and universities. USF rests on a
hilltop in a quiet, 51 acre setting between the Presidio and Golden Gate Park
and is equidistant from the Pacific Ocean and the San Francisco Bay. It is one
of the oldest institutions of higher learning in California. USF s MBA program
was ranked among the Top 100 in 2004 by the Wall Street Journal and the
Princeton Review ranked it among the Top 143 in 2005. USF s 8,500 member student
body is composed of students from 75 countries, and are ranked in the Top 15
national universities for student diversity and international student
enrollment. USF s thousands of alumni span the globe and provide an invaluable
career mentoring network for both current students and new graduates. USF is
accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, and the School of
Business and Management  SOBAM  is accredited by the AACSB.

History Founded as Saint Ignatius Academy by the Italian Jesuits Anthony
Maraschi, Joseph Bixio, and Michael Accolti in 1855, USF began life in a wood
frame building along Market Street in what later became downtown San Francisco.
A charter from the state of California in 1859 changed the school s name to
Saint Ignatius College and granted it the power to confer degrees. The original
curriculum included Greek, Spanish, Latin, English, French, Italian, algebra,
arithmetic, history, geography, elocution, and bookkeeping.

A new building was constructed in 1862 to replace the first frame building and
the first degree was awarded a year later. In 1880, the college moved from
Market Street to a new site on the corner of Hayes Street and Van Ness Avenue
 currently occupied by the Davies Symphony Hall . The third Saint Ignatius
College was destroyed in the earthquake and fire of 1906 and the campus moved
further westward to the corner of Hayes and Shrader Streets, close to Golden
Gate Park. The college moved to its present site on the south slope of Lone
Mountain, in 1927.

, the year of Saint Ignatius Academy s foundation]] To celebrate its diamond
jubilee in 1930, Saint Ignatius College changed its name to the University of
San Francisco. A male only school for most of its history, USF became fully
coeducational in 1964. In 1969, the high school division became wholly separate
from the university and became St. Ignatius College Preparatory.

Today USF is organized into six academic divisions, with 7,487 students and 506
faculty members. The university also operates five regional campuses around
northern California. USF is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and
Colleges, and the School of Business and Management  SOBAM  is accredited by the
AACSB.

In September 2005 USF admitted 161 students from Loyola University New Orleans,
Xavier University of Louisiana, Tulane University, Dillard University,
University of New Orleans, and University of Southern Mississippi who were
displaced by Hurricane
Katrina.[http   cbs5.com local local_story_251111104.html]
