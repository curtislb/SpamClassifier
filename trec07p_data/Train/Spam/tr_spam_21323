Plot

The movie opens in a Wyoming brothel in 1880, as a cowboy slashes a prostitute s
face for laughing at his small genitalia. The sheriff fines the cowboy and his
friend  who held down the prostitute at first, then quickly tried to stop the
attacker  seven ponies  mdash  payable to the saloon owner and pimp Skinny. The
prostitute s co workers are furious that the two cowboys received only a fine
for their attack and offer a $1000 reward to anyone who kills them.

A would be assassin calling himself the Schofield Kid  Woolvett , in his search
for partners, recruits William Munny  Eastwood   mdash  an infamous retired
gunfighter, murderer, and bandit who has married and been reformed by an honest
woman. Following his wife s death he lives simply as a widowed father of two
young children and a pig farmer whose stock is dying of swine fever. Munny
recruits a former associate and neighbor, Ned Logan  Freeman , to help them hunt
down the two men responsible for the attack on the prostitute and claim the
large bounty.

Meanwhile, another gunman,  English Bob   Harris , is also on his way to collect
the bounty. Bob arrives in town and facetiously claims that he is not carrying
firearms, even though his revolver is in plain sight. Bob has also enlisted a
writer to chronicle his experiences, in a book called  The Duke of Death. 
Little Bill Daggett  Hackman , the venomous local sheriff and a former
gunfighter, corners Bob and his biographer. After disarming Bob, Little Bill
then ruthlessly beats him, to serve as an example to all those who are trying to
collect the prostitutes  bounty.

As Little Bill ridicules and insults the jailed English Bob for the benefit of
his biographer, Logan and Munny catch up to the Kid. After reaching town on a
cold, rainy night, they enter a saloon for a drink and inquire about the reward.
Munny remains at a table while Logan and the Kid go upstairs to be serviced by
the prostitutes. While waiting for his friends to return, Little Bill discovers
Munny is wearing a gun. A town ordinance prohibits guns  mdash  upon entering
town that stormy night, Munny failed  or chose not  to see the warning sign
posted alongside the road. Weak and feverish, Munny is in no condition to fight
back as Little Bill brutally beats him in full view of the patrons. Munny
manages to drag himself out of the saloon as Ned Logan and the Kid jump out a
second story window. Logan and the Kid then get Munny to high country above the
town.    as William Munny]] Munny retreats and is nursed by his friends and the
prostitutes, and after recovering sufficiently from his injuries, the three men
