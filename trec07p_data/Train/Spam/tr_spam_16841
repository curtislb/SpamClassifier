Genuine Swiss made Rolex replicas are as close to the real thing 
as a replica watch can be.
Not always even the professional jewelers are unable to tell the difference from the real Rolex watch.  
All genuine Swiss Rolex Replicas should have the following:• Full 1-year Warranty 
  • Solid 14k or 18k Gold on two-toned models
  • Guaranteed triple-wrapped gold on all-gold models 
  • Genuine sapphire crystal - a type of glass that is many times better 
  at resisting scratches than regular glass.
  • The color of the gold looks exactly like a genuine Rolex watch If the retail dealer does not offer this, do not purchase from them!REPLICA \/\/atches BAZAAR!
