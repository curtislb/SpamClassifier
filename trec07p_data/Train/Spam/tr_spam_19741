Introducing the Vibrating Ring 

Its patented design is both comfortable and washable. The Ring section
easily stretches to fit any size and is made of non-toxic silicone rubber
material that is both soft and hygienic.

The Vibrating Ring features a raised tickler with thinly sculptured ridges
especially designed to stimulate her c-spot and a micro vibration motor
which produces pulsating sensations through the shaft promoting multiple
pleasures.

It's self-powered & has a switch to turn the device on and off as you
choose. So you're in control.
