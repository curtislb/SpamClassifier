The  swallows  and  martins  are a group of passerine birds in the family
 Hirundinidae  which are characterised by their adaptation to aerial feeding.
Swallow is also used in Europe as a synonym for the Barn Swallow.

This family comprises two subfamilies   Pseudochelidoninae   the river martins
of the genus Pseudochelidon  and  Hirundininae   all other swallows and
martins . Within the Hirundiniae, the name martin tends to be used for the squarer 
tailed species, and the name swallow for the more fork tailed species  however,
there is no scientific distinction between these two groups.

It is believed that this family originated in Africa as hole nesters  Africa
still has the greatest diversity of species.

Description Swallows have adapted to hunting insects on the wing by developing a
slender streamlined body, and long pointed wings, which allows great
manoeuvrability and endurance.

Like the unrelated swifts and nightjars, which hunt in a similar way, they have
short bills, but strong jaws and a wide gape. Their body length ranges from
about 10   24 cm  3.9   9.4 in  and their weight from about 10   60 g  0.4   2.1
oz . The wings are long, pointed, and have nine primary feathers. The tail has
12 feathers and may be deeply forked, somewhat indented, or square ended. A long
tail increases manoeuvrability, and may also function as a sexual adornment,
since the tail is frequently longer in males. Female Barn Swallows will select
mates on the basis of tail length.

The legs are short, and their feet are designed for perching rather than
walking, as the front toes are partially joined at the base, causing the bird to
display a waddling gait.

The most common hirundine plumage is glossy dark blue or green above and plain
or streaked underparts, often white or rufous. Species which burrow or live in
dry or mountainous areas are often unglossed brown above  eg Sand Martin and
Crag Martin . The sexes show no, or only limited, sexual dimorphism, with longer
outer tail feathers in the adult male probably being the commonest distinction
where one exists.

The chicks hatch naked and with closed eyes. Fledged juveniles usually appear as
duller versions of the adult.

Habitat

Swallows typically build mud nests close to overhead shelter in locations that
are protected from both the weather and predators. Many cave and cliff dwelling
species of swallow nest in large colonies. In historical times, the introduction
of man made stone structures such as barns and bridges, together with forest
clearance, has led to an abundance of colony sites around the globe,
significantly increasing the breeding ranges of some species. Birds living in
large colonies typically have to contend with both ectoparasites and conspecific
nest parasitism. Old males benefit most from coloniality, since they are able to
maintain their own nests and benefit from frequent extra pair copulations.

Behavior Swallows are excellent fliers, and use these skills to attract a mate
and to defend territory. In general, the males select a nest site, and then
attract a female using song and flight, and guard their territory. The size of
the territory varies depending on the species of swallow  in colonial nesting
species it tends to be small, but it may be much larger for solitary nesters.

Pairs of mated swallows are
monogamous, ref http   www.eeb.cornell.edu winkler botw hirundinidae.html  ref 
and pairs of non migratory species often stay near their breeding area all year,
though the nest site is defended most vigorously during the breeding season.
Migratory species often return to the same breeding area each year, and may
select same nest site if they were previously successful in that location. First 
year breeders generally select a nesting site close to where they were born and
raised. ref http   www.answers.com topic swallows hirundinidae biological 
family  ref 

Most species hunt over open country or near water.

Swallows are able to produce many different calls or songs, which are used to
