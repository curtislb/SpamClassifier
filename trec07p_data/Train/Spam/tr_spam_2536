 Fiji   Fijian   Matanitu ko Viti   Hindust  n                    ,           ,
officially the  Republic of the Fiji Islands , is an island nation in the South
Pacific Ocean east of Vanuatu, west of Tonga and south of Tuvalu. The country
occupies an archipelago of about 322 islands, of which 106 are permanently
inhabited, and 522 islets. The two major islands, Viti Levu and Vanua Levu,
account for 87  of the population. The name Fiji is the old Tongan word for the
islands, which in turn is derived from the Fijian name Viti.

A military coup d   tat led by Commodore Frank Bainimarama deposed the civilian
government of Laisenia Qarase on 5 December 2006, with Bainimarama declaring
that he had  reluctantly  assumed the functions of the Presidency in an interim
capacity. He handed the presidency back to Ratu Josefa Iloilo on 4 January 2007,
and was appointed interim Prime Minister by Iloilo the next day.

History , 1842.]]

The first inhabitants of Fiji arrived from South East Asia long before contact
with European explorers in the seventeenth century. Pottery excavated from
Fijian towns show that Fiji was settled before or around 1000 nbsp BC. This
question of Pacific migration still lingers.[http   humanities.cqu.edu.au histo 
ry 52148 modules pacific_peoplesA.html ] The Dutch explorer Abel Tasman visited
Fiji in 1643 while looking for the Great Southern Continent. nbsp [http   www.a 
nswers.com main ntquery jsessionid ch285bg7t494l?method 4 dsid 2222 dekey Abel+ 
Tasman gwp 8 curtab 2222_1 sbid lc05b linktext Abel 20Tasman] It was not until
the nineteenth century, however, that Europeans settled the islands
permanently. nbsp [http   www.janesoceania.com oceania_history] The islands came
under British control as a colony in 1874, and the British brought over Indian
contract laborers. It was granted independence in 1970. Democratic rule was
interrupted by two military coups in 1987 because the government was perceived
as dominated by the Indo Fijian  Indian  community. The second 1987 coup saw the
British monarchy and the Governor General replaced by a non executive President,
and the country changed the long form of its name from Dominion of Fiji to
Republic of Fiji  and to Republic of the Fiji Islands in 1997 . The coups
contributed to heavy Indian emigration  the population loss resulted in economic
difficulties but ensured that Melanesians became the majority.

In 1990, the new Constitution institutionalised the ethnic Fijian domination of
the political system. The Group Against Racial Discrimination  GARD  was formed
to oppose the unilaterally imposed constitution and restore the 1970
constitution. Sitiveni Rabuka, the Lieutenant Colonel who carried out the 1987
coup became Prime Minister in 1992, following elections held under the new
constitution. Three years later, Rabuka established the Constitutional Review
Commission, which in 1997 led to a new Constitution, which was supported by most
leaders of the indigenous Fijian and Indo Fijian communities. Fiji is re 
admitted to the Commonwealth of Nations.

The new millennium brought along another coup, instigated by George Speight,
that effectively toppled the government of Mahendra Chaudhry, who became Prime
Minister following the 1997 constitution. Commodore Frank Bainimarama assumed
executive power after the resignation, possibly forced, of President Mara. Fiji
was rocked by two mutinies at Suva s Queen Elizabeth Barracks, later in 2000
when rebel soldiers went on the rampage. The High Court ordered the
reinstatement of the constitution, and in September 2001, a General election was
held to restore democracy, which was won by interim Prime Minister Laisenia
Qarase s Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua party.

In 2005, amid much controversy, the Qarase government proposed a Reconciliation
and Unity Commission, with power to recommend compensation for victims of the
2000 coup, and amnesty for its perpetrators. However, the military strongly
opposed this bill, especially the army s commander, Frank Baini</STYLE>
