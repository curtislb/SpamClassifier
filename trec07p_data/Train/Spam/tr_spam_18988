    Palmyra  was in the ancient times an important city of central Syria,
located in an oasis 215 km northeast of Damascus and 120 km southwest of the
Euphrates. It has long been a vital caravan city for travellers crossing the
Syrian desert and was known as the Bride of the Desert. The Greek name for the
city, Palmyra                 , is a translation of its original Aramaic name,
 Tadmor , which means  palm tree . Tadmor  in Arabic           is today the name
of a small city next to the ruins, heavily dependent on tourism.

History

Ancient In the mid first century, Palmyra, a wealthy and elegant Syrian city
located along the caravan routes linking the Parthian Iran with the
Mediterranean ports of Roman Syria and Phoenicia, came under Roman control.
During the following period of great prosperity, the Aramaean citizens of
Palmyra adopted customs and modes of dress from both the Iranian Parthian world
to the east and the Graeco Roman west.

The city was first mentioned in the archives of Mari in the 2nd millennium BC.
It was another trading city in the extensive trade network that linked
Mesopotamia and northern Syria. Tadmor is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible  Second
Book of Chronicles 8.4  as a desert city that is fortified by Solomon. Terry
Jones and Alan Ereira write in Barbarians p183 

 There has been a temple at Palmyra, for instance, for 2000 years before the
Romans ever saw it. It s form, a large stone walled chamber with columns
outside, is much closer to the sort of thing attributed to Solomon than to
anything Roman. It is mentioned in the Bible as part of Solomon s Kingdom. In
fact, it says he built it.  2 Chronicles 8 v 4.  

The city of Tamar is mentioned in the First Book of Kings  9.18 , also fortified
by Solomon. This is traditionally read  see Qere  as Tadmor, but may refer to
place near the Dead Sea.

Tadmor is also mentioned as built by Solomon in Flavius Josephus Antiquities of
the Jews   Book VIII, along with the Greek name of Palmyra.

Tadmor is the name of Palmyra in modern Hebrew. The exact etymology of the name
 Palmyra  in this case is unknown, although some scholars believe it was related
to the palm trees in the area. Others, however, are less certain, and believe it
may have come out of an incorrect translation of the name  Tadmor.  c.f.
Colledge, Seyrig, Starcky, and others.

When the Seleucids took control of Syria in 323 BC, the city was left to itself
and it became independent. The city flourished as a caravan halt in the 1st
century BC. In 41 BC, the Romans under Mark Antony tried to occupy Palmyra but
failed as the Palmyrans escaped to the other side of the Euphrates. The
Palmyrans had received intelligence of the Roman approach. This proves that at
that time Palmyra was still a nomadic settlement and its valuables could be
removed at short notice.

Jones and Erieira note that Palmyran merchants owned ships in Italian waters and
controlled the Indian silk trade.  Palmyra became one of the richest cities of
the Near East.  The Palmyrans had really pulled off a great trick, they were the
only people who managed to live alongside Rome without being Romanized. They
simply pretended to be Romans. 

Palmyra was made part of the Roman province of Syria during the reign of
Tiberius  14 ndash 37 . It steadily grew in importance as a trade route linking
Persia, India, China, and the Roman empire. In 129, Hadrian visited the city and
was so enthralled by it that he proclaimed it a free city and renamed it Palmyra
Hadriana.

Beginning in 212, Palmyra s trade diminished as the Sassanids occupied the mouth
of the Tigris and the Euphrates. Septimius Odaenathus, a Prince of Palmyra, was
appointed by Valerian as the governor of the province of Syria. After Valerian
was captured by the Sassanids and died in captivity in Bishapur, Odaenathus
campaigned as far as Ctesiphon  near modern day Baghdad  for revenge, invading
the city twice. When Odaenathus was assassinated by his nephew Maconius, his
wife Septimia Zenobia took power, ruling Palmyra on the behalf of her son,
Vabalathus. Zenobia rebelled against Roman authority wi</STYLE>
