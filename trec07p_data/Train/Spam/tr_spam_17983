The  Monarch butterfly   Danaus plexippus  is a well known North American
butterfly. Since the 19th century, it is also found in New Zealand, and in
Australia where it is also known as the  Wanderer Butterfly . In Europe it is
resident in the Canary Islands  except Lanzarote  and Madeira, and is found as a
migrant in the Azores, Portugal and Spain. Its wings feature an easily
recognizable orange and black pattern, with a wingspan of 8.5 ndash 12.5 cm
 3.34 in ndash 4.92in . The females have darker veins on their wings, and the
males have a spot in the center of each hindwing from which pheromones are
released.

Migration ]] ]] during winter.]] overwintering site in Mexico.]] Monarchs are
especially noted for their lengthy annual migration. They make massive southward
migrations from August through until the first frost. A northward migration
takes place in the spring. Female Monarchs deposit eggs for the next generation
during these migrations. The population east of the Rocky Mountains sanctuaries
in the area of Angangueo, Michoac  n, El Rosario, Mexico, and the western
population overwinters in various sites in central coastal California, United
States, notably in Pacific Grove and Santa Cruz. The length of these journeys
exceeds the normal lifespan of most Monarchs, which is less than two months for
butterflies born in early summer. The last generation of the summer enters into
a non reproductive phase known as diapause and may live up to 7 months. During
diapause, butterflies fly to one of many overwintering sites. The generation
that overwinters generally does not reproduce until it leaves the overwintering
site sometime in February and March. It is thought that the overwinter
population may reach as far north as Texas and Oklahoma during the spring
migration. It is the second, third and fourth generations that return to their
northern locations in the United States and Canada in the spring. How the
species manages to return to the same overwintering spots over a gap of several
generations is still a subject of research  the flight patterns appear to be
inherited, based on a combination of circadian rhythm and the position of the
sun in the sky. ref  Gugliotta, Guy  2003

This is one of the few insects to manage transatlantic crossings. Once very
common in Bermuda, they are becoming endangered due to the loss of milkweed,
eradicated as a weed. A few Monarchs turn up in the far southwest of Great
Britain in years when the wind conditions are right. Monarchs can also be found
in New Zealand during summer, but are absent the rest of the year.

On the island of Hawaii no migrations have been noted. Monarchs can live a life
of six to eight weeks in a garden having their host [[Asclepias]] plants and
sufficient flowers for nectar. This is especially true if the flower garden
happens to be surrounded by native forest that seems to be lacking in flowers.

Reproduction

The mating period for the overwinter population occurs in the spring, just prior
to migration from the overwintering sites. The courtship is fairly simple and
less dependent on chemical pheromones in comparison with other species in its
genus. Courtship is composed of two distinct stages, the aerial phase and the
ground phase. During the aerial phase, the male pursues, nudges, and eventually
takes down the female. Copulation occurs during the ground phase and involves
the transfer of a spermatophore from the male to female. Along with sperm, the
spermatophore is thought to provide the female with energy resources that aid
her in carrying out reproduction and remigration. The overwinter population
returns only as far north as they need to go to find the early milkweed growth 
in the case of the eastern butterflies that is commonly southern Texas.

Once they reach their breeding grounds, the females lay their eggs on milkweed
host plants. The egg and larval period is temperature dependent and lasts about
2 weeks. At the end of </STYLE>
