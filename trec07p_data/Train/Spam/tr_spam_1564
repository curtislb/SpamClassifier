The  University of Western Sydney  is a public, multi campus, higher educational
institute located in the Western Sydney region of New South Wales, Australia. It
was formed in 1989 as the University of Western Sydney Federation. It is
considered by many a leading university especially through its links to the
Greater Western sydney.

History The University today has a legislative basis in NSW state legislation
with the passing of the University of Western Sydney Act of 1997, which also
empowers the university to make by laws affecting the operation of the
university. The University consists of an amalgamation of campuses, each with
their own unique and individual history, however due to the university
attempting to unify all campuses under the one logo, clear distinctions between
the natures of individual campuses are becoming hard to find. The oldest campus,
Hawkesbury campus, was founded in 1891 by the NSW Agricultural society.

In 2000, after internal restructuring, the Hawkesbury, Macarthur and Nepean
campuses ceased to exist as autonomous components of the now defunct University
of Western Sydney Federation and became a part of the new multi campus
University of Western Sydney.

Campuses The University of Western Sydney is made up of six campuses and two
precincts, each campus hosting their own unique array of courses, the unit
loading of which may be shared across campuses.

Campbelltown Campus UWS Campbelltown Campus is located in Campbelltown, in south 
western Sydney. Together with the Bankstown campus, the Campbelltown campus was
originally part of the Macarthur Institute of Higher Education, founded in 1984.
As of the year 2007, the Campbelltown campus will have the privilege of hosting
the Bachelor of Medicine Bachelor of Surgery  MBBS  degree, with students
eventually being dispatched to  and contractually tied to  the area of Western
Sydney.

Bankstown Campus UWS Bankstown Campus is a relatively new campus, located within
the City of Bankstown. The campus is located in Milperra, about 5 10 minutes
from the Bankstown CBD. Specialising in the social sciences, most of the
students on campus are psychology, sociology, nursing, arts and linguistic
students. The campus also has the privilege of hosting the Bachelor of Policing
degree, the only degree of its kind in NSW  excluding the official course which
is offered at Charles Sturt University . The campus also includes a modern
cafeteria eatery area, a full size football oval and is home to the MARCS
Sensory Laboratories. Adjacent to the campus is Mount Saint Joseph Catholic
Secondary Girls High School. UWS s most well known interpreting and translation
course is taught at Bankstown campus. UWS trains and produces many NAATI
accredited interpreters and translators. The oldest building on campus was
opened in 1989. The building contains a plaque indicating that it was opened by
the then treasurer Paul Keating, who later became Prime Minister of Australia.

Blacktown Campus The UWS Blacktown Campus is built on the site of the HMAS
Nirimba, a former naval base, and is also known as the Nirimba Campus. It is
located in the Nirimba Education Precinct, in Quakers Hill, about 10 minutes
from the Blacktown CBD. The UWS Campus shares facilities with two schools, one
public high school and one Catholic College. There is also a TAFE on site.
Facilities include a bar, cafe, outdoor dining area, co op bookshop, a
newsagent, library, pool and gym. Most students on the campus are building,
urban planning and accounting students.

Hawkesbury Campus UWS Hawkesbury Campus, also known as the Richmond campus, is
located on a 1300 hectare site in the Hawkesbury Valley in north western Sydney,
near the town of Richmond. The campus was originally the Hawkesbury Agricultural
College, established by the New South Wales Department of Agriculture in 1891.
Its facilities include several sports fields, bookshop, hairdresser, library and
cafeteria.

The Hawkesbury Campus also houses the Centre for Native Fauna and Arid Land
research. The Centre is also known to be among the world leaders in rural
agricultural management and regeneration strategies. This campus is also home to
the Forensic Science degree and holds a crime scene house, various forensic lab
equipment, and a  body  farm.

Rydalmere Campus Often called the Parramatta campus by the University, the
Rydalmere campus was established in the 1800s as a female orphan school. The
