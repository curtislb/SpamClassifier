Drug Coated Stents - Health Alert Newsletter - April 14th, 2007 



The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, cited studies this week 

showing drug-coated stent recipients face a significant blood-clot risk. 



The makers of leading drug-coated stents include Johnson & Johnson, 

Cypher Drug Coated Stents and Boston Scientific, Taxus Extreme Drug Coated Stents. 



Drug-coated stents have been placed in about 6 million people worldwide. 



If you or someone you know has had a drug-coated stent implanted they may be at risk. 

If so, you or that someone may be entitled to monetary damages.
