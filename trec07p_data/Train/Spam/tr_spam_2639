<P class=3DSTYLE1><SPAN class=3DSTYLE20>UFO in the Pool!</SPAN> The water c=
annon is exactly in the shape of UFO. The difference is that it can only =
=A1=A7fly=A1=A8 on the water but not the sky. This is remote controlled by =
a simple radio, easy for kids to command to move forward, backward, or spin=
 in circles. Look, there=A1=A6s a nozzle. It can be moved up and down, whil=
e the stream of water bursts as high as 10 inches. That=A1=A6s powerful! A =
good gadget to annoy your friends in or near the pool and whatever water en=
vironment. Powered by 4 AA battaries, and retails for $129. But I think the=
re is still room of improvement for it: make it dive in the water.<BR>by <A=
