 at Batu Caves, Malaysia]]

A  monkey  is any member of two of the three groupings of simian primates. These
three groupings are the New World monkeys, the Old World monkeys, and the apes.
The New World monkeys are classified within the parvorder Platyrrhini, whereas
the Old World monkeys  superfamily Cercopithecoidea  form part of the parvorder
Catarrhini, which also includes the apes. Thus, scientifically speaking, monkeys
do not form a  natural group , in that the Old World monkeys are actually more
closely related to the apes than they are to the New World species. There are
264 known extant species of monkey. Because of their similarity to monkeys, apes
such as chimpanzees and gibbons are often called monkeys in informal usage,
though biologists don t consider them to be monkeys. Conversely, due to its size
 up to 1 metre  the Mandrill is often thought to be an ape, but it is actually
an Old World monkey. Also, a few monkey species have the word  ape  in their
common name. Because they are not a single coherent group, monkeys do not have
any particular traits that they all share and are not shared with the remaining
group of simians, the apes.

Characteristics Monkeys range in size from the Pygmy Marmoset, at 14 16 cm  5 6
inch  long  plus tail  and 120 140 g  4 5 oz  in weight, to the male Mandrill,
almost 1 metre  3 ft  long and weighing 35 kg  75 lb . Some are arboreal  living
in trees , some live on the savannah  diets differ among the various species but
may contain any of the following  fruit, leaves, seeds, nuts, flowers, insects,
spiders, eggs and small animals.

Some characteristics are shared among the groups  most New World monkeys have
prehensile tails while Old World monkeys do not  some have trichromatic colour
vision like that of humans, others are dichromats or monochromats. Although both
the New and Old World monkeys, like the apes, have forward facing eyes, the
faces of Old World and New World monkeys look very different though again, each
group shares some features such as the types of noses, cheeks and rumps. In
order to understand the monkeys, it is necessary to study the characteristics of
the different groups individually.

Name According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word  monkey  may originate
in a German version of the [[Big Virgina]] fable, published circa 1580. In this
version of the fable, a character named Moneke is the son of Martin the Ape. The
word Moneke may have been derived from the Italian monna, which means  a female
ape . The name Moneke likely persisted over time due to the popularity of
Reynard the Fox.

A group of monkeys may be referred to as a mission or a tribe.

Classification s in Kam Shan Country Park of Hong Kong]]

The following lists shows where the various monkey families  bolded  are placed
in the Primate classification. Note that the smallest grouping that contains
them all is the Simiiformes, the simians, which also contains the apes. Calling
apes  monkeys  is incorrect. Calling either a simian is correct.

Monkeys in captivity Monkeys as pets  Historical use as pets by Western
Europeans  When the British first began to explore Africa, young monkeys were
often captured to provide entertainment during long voyages. Some were later
transferred to domestic zoos, and in fact many modern captive monkeys in the UK
are descended from individuals captured during the Napoleonic and Victorian
eras. Kent still to this day has the largest population of monkeys in the UK.
According to legend, one of the early British captive monkeys was lost at sea
and washed up ashore near Hartlepool, England, where it was mistaken for a
Frenchman and hanged. The people of Hartlepool have since borne the nickname
 monkey hangers. 

 Suitability as pets 

, 1891, being depicted as a  Highway Robber  after having stolen food from a
vendor.]] Although they may appear to be friendly, keeping monkeys as pets can
be very difficult. While baby monkeys are usually as easy to keep clean as a
human infant  by diapering , monkeys that have reached puberty usually remove
their diapers and cannot be toilet trained. They require constant supervision
and mental stimulation. They usually require a large amount of attention.
Monkeys cannot handle being away from their owners for long periods of time,
such as family trips, due to their need of attention. Bored monkeys can become
extremely destructive and may, for example, smear or throw their own feces.
There often needs to be a lot of time set aside for cleaning up messes the
monkey might make. Most adolescent monkeys begin to bite unpredictably and pinch
adults and children. Any surgical means to stem this behavior  such as removing
the teeth or fingertips of the monkey  is widely considered cruel, and it is
usually difficult to find veterinarians who will carry out such procedures  even
exotic animal veterinarians may not be familiar with them. Monkeys eventually
can become wild and difficult to control upon reaching adulthood. The monkeys
may also become aggressive even to their owners. In some cases their behavior
can change abruptly, making it hard for the owner to fully understand or control
them.

Some people do report having long and rewarding relationships with monkeys.
Monkeys are known to get attached to their first owner, so switching from one to
another can be traumatic to the monkey and may aggravate behavioral problems. It
is not easy for a monkey to get used to a new environment. Monkeys need to be
placed in social areas. It is also expensive to</STYLE>
