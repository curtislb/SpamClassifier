CDPN Acquires GPS And Wireless Transportation Development Company!

China Datacom Corp.
Sym: CDPN
Close: $0.065

CDPN, through its subsidiary "Supremacy Intl", acquired all outstanding
shares in General Link Information Systems. General manages, serves and
operates the only GPS vehicle monitoring and management system in China,
and provides a wide range of mobile applications for the transport
industry. This is HOT! It's already taking off, volume jumped through
the roof Friday! Read the release and get in on CDPN first thing Monday.

they deleted Gisburne's entire account.
He felt strongly that we needed to have guest cartoonists come in to
spice things up.
The ad was intentionally tongue-in- cheek and, at least in my mind, a
tacit admission that it's much more fun to use Google as a verb than to
use it properly.
