 calendar, from the Aztec Sun Stone.]] A  day   symbol  d  is a unit of time
 equivalent to 24 hours. It is not an SI unit but it is accepted for use with
 SI ref http   physics.nist.gov Pubs SP811 sec05.html  ref . The SI unit of time
 is the second.

The term comes from the Old English d  g, with similar terms common in all other
Indo European languages, such as dies in Latin and dive in Sanskrit.

Definitions The day has several definitions.

International System of Units  SI  A day is defined as 86,400 seconds. Those are
currently defined as  blockquote     the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of
the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels
of the ground state of the caesium 133 atom.  blockquote  This makes the SI day
last exactly 794,243,384,928,000 of those periods.

In the 19th century it had also been suggested to make a decimal fraction  E   4
or E   5  of an astronomic day the base unit of time. This was an afterglow of
decimal time and calendar, which had been given up already.

Astronomy For a given planet, there are two types of day defined in astronomy   
1 apparent sidereal day    a single rotation of a planet with respect to the
distant stars
   for Earth it is 23.934 solar hours 
  1 solar day    a single rotation of a planet with respect to its Sun.

Colloquial The word refers to various relatedly defined ideas, including the
following   the period of light when the Sun is above the local horizon  i.e.,
the time period from sunrise to sunset .  the full day covering a dark and a
light period, beginning from the beginning of the dark period or from a point
near the middle of the dark period.  A full dark and light period, sometimes
called a [[nychthemeron]] in English, from the Greek for night day.  The time
period from 6 00 AM to 6 00 PM or 9 00 PM or some other fixed clock period
overlapping or set off from other time periods such as  morning ,  evening , or
 night .

Introduction The word day is used for several different units of time based on
the rotation of the Earth around its axis. The most important one follows the
apparent motion of the Sun across the sky  solar day  see solar time . The
reason for this apparent motion is the rotation of the Earth around its axis, as
well as the revolution of the Earth in its orbit around the Sun.

A day, as opposed to night, is commonly defined as the period during which
sunlight directly reaches the ground, assuming that there are no local
obstacles. Two effects make days on average longer than nights. The Sun is not a
point, but has an apparent size of about 32 minutes of arc. Additionally, the
atmosphere refracts sunlight in such a way that some of it reaches the ground
even when the Sun is below the horizon by about 34 minutes of arc. So the first
light reaches the ground when the centre of the Sun is still below the horizon
by about 50 minutes of arc. The difference in time depends on the angle at which
the Sun rises and sets  itself a function of latitude , but amounts to almost
seven minutes at least.

Ancient custom has a new day start at either the rising or setting of the Sun on
the local horizon  Italian reckoning, for example . The exact moment of, and the
interval between, two sunrises or two sunsets depends on the geographical
position  longitude as well as latitude , and the time of year. This is the time
as indicated by ancient hemispherical sundials.

A more constant day can be defined by the Sun passing through the local
meridian, which happens at local noon  upper culmination  or midnight  lower
culmination . The exact moment is dependent on the geographical longitude, and
to a lesser extent on the time of the year. The length of such a day is nearly
constant  24 hours    30 seconds . This is the time as indicated by modern
sundials.

A further improvement defines a fictitious mean Sun that moves with constant
speed along the celestial equator  the speed is the same as the average speed of
the real Sun, but this removes the variation over a year as the Earth moves
along its orbit around the Sun  due to both its velocity and its axial tilt .

The Earth s day has increased in length over time. The original length of one
day, when the Earth was new about 4.5 billion years ago, was about six hours as
determined by computer simulation. It was 21.9 hours 620 million years ago as
recorded by rhythmites  alternating layers in sandstone . This phenomenon is due
to tides raised by the Moon which slow Earth s rotation. Because of the way the
second is defined, the mean length of a day is now about 86,400.002 seconds, and
is increasing by about 1.7 milliseconds per century  an average over the last
2700 years . See tidal acceleration for details.

Civil day For civil purposes a common clock time has been defined for an entire
region based on the mean lo</STYLE>
