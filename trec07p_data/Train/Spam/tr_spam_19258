from Mrs elizabeth dafinone.
Attn:Dear beloved,
I am the above named person from Romania . I am married to Mr.silas dafinone who worked with Ivory Coast embassy in Romania  for nine years before we left to Abidjan where he was re-appointed a director of international affairs and strategic studies. before his untimely death in the year 2003.
We were married for eleven years without a child. He died in his home country Ivory Coast after a brief illness that lasted for only 5 weeks Before his death we were both born again Christian. Since his death I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against. 
When my late husband was alive he deposited the  sum 7.5M USD. seven million five hundred thousand  U.S. Dollars councelled in one metalic box deposited in a security company  here in Abidjan.Presently, this fund is still in the security company.Recently, my Doctor told me that i have serious sickness which is cancer problem. The one that disturbs me most is the high blood preasure sickness. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to a church or individual that will utilize 
this money the way I am going to instruct herein. 
I want a church or individual that will use this fund for orphanages, widows,propagating the word of God and to endeavor that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that“Blessed is the hand that giveth” I took this decision because I don’t have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don’t want my husband’s efforts to be used by unbelievers. I don’t want a situation where this money will be used in an unGodly way.This is the reason why I am taking this decision. 
I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bossom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that “the lor will fight my case and I shall hold my peace”. I don’t need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health hence the presence of my husband’s relatives were around me always. I don’t want them to know about this development.
With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the security company here in Abidjan. I will also issue you an authority letter that will prove you the present beneficiary of this  fund.I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shephard. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian.Whoever that Wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and  
Truth.Please always be prayerful all through your life.
for more informations, Please assure me that you will  act accordingly as I Stated herein.
Hoping to receive your reply.presently,I am still in my late husbands home country Abidjan capital city of ivory coast.
Remain blessed in the Lord.
Yours in Christ,
Mrs elizabeth dafinone . from Mrs elizabeth dafinone.
