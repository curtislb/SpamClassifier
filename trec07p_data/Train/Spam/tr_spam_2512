 poses]]  Bodybuilding  is the process of developing muscle fibres through the
 combination of weight training, specific caloric intake, and rest. Someone who
 engages in this activity is referred to as a  bodybuilder . As a sport, called
 competitive bodybuilding, bodybuilders display their physiques to a panel of
 judges, who assign points based on their aesthetic appearance. Famous
 bodybuilders include Arnold Schwarzenegger, Lou Ferrigno, Steve Reeves, Serge
 Nubret, Larry Scott, and more recently, Ronnie Coleman, and Jay Cutler. History
 Early years

The  Early Years  of Bodybuilding are considered to be the period between 1880
and 1930.

Bodybuilding  the art of displaying the muscles of the physical body  did not
really exist prior to the late 19th century, when it was promoted by a man from
Prussia named Eugen Sandow, ref name  SandowMuseum  Sandow  Historic Photographs
of Early Bodybuilders   The Sandow Museum  History of Bodybuilding   A Tribute
to Eugen Sandow [http   www.sandowmuseum.com  Homepage]  ref  who is now
generally referred to as  The Father of Modern Bodybuilding . He is credited as
being a pioneer of the sport because he allowed an audience to enjoy viewing his
physique in  muscle display performances . Although audiences thrilled seeing a
well developed physique, those men simply displayed their bodies as part of
strength demonstrations or wrestling matches. Sandow had a stage show built
around these displays through his manager, Florenz Ziegfeld. He became so
successful at it, he later created several businesses around his fame and was
among the first to market products branded with his name alone. As he became
more popular, he was credited with inventing and selling the first exercise
equipment for the masses  machined dumbbells, spring pulleys and tension bands .

Sandow was a strong advocate of  the Grecian Ideal   this was a standard where a
mathematical  ideal  was set up and the  perfect physique  was close to the
proportions of ancient Greek and Roman statues from classical times . This is
how Sandow built his own physique and in the early years, men were judged by how
closely they matched these  ideal  proportions. Sandow organised the first
bodybuilding contest on 14 September, 1901 called the  Great Competition  and
held in the Royal Albert Hall, London, UK. Judged by himself, Sir Charles Lawes,
and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle the contest was a huge success and was sold out and
hundreds of physical culture enthusiasts were turned away. The trophy presented
to the winner was a bronze statue of Sandow himself sculpted by Frederick
Pomeroy. The winner was William L. Murray of Nottingham, England. The most
prestigious bodybuilding contest today is the Mr. Olympia, and since 1977, the
winner has been presented with the same bronze statue of Sandow he himself
presented to the winner at the first contest. ref

On 16 January, 1904, the first large scale bodybuilding competition in America
took place at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The winner was Al Treloar
and he was declared  The Most Perfectly Developed Man in the World . Treloar won
a $1,000 cash prize, a substantial sum at that time. Two weeks later, Thomas
Edison made a film of Al Treloar s posing routine. Edison also made two films of
Sandow a few years before, making him the man who made the first three motion
pictures featuring a bodybuilder. In the early 20th century, Bernarr Macfadden
and Charles Atlas, continued to promote bodybuilding across the world. Alois P.
Swoboda was an early pioneer in America and the man who Charles Atlas credited
with his success in his statement   Everything that I know I learned from A. P.
 Alois  Swoboda. 

Other important bodybuilders in the early history of bodybuilding prior to 1930
include  Earle Liederman  writer of some of the earliest bodybuilding
instruction books , Seigmund Breitbart  famous Jewish bodybuilder , Georg
Hackenschmidt, George F. Jowe</STYLE>
