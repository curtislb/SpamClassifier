Dear customer.This is the letter from the CanadianPharmacy. We prove that "generic" doesn't necessarily mean "expensive". If you shop for drugs online, please, read this to the end."High price proves the high quality of the drug" That's what all Web pharmacies say in their ads. All except CanadianPharmacy. Drug sales tax is much lower here in Canada so we don't have any trouble dumping our rivals into tears. CanadianPharmacy generic quality CAN be cheap.CanadianPharmacy turn Canadian drug sales taxation system to your advantage.Yours,Inez Cope
