 Lawrence of Arabia  is an award winning 1962 film based on the life of T. E.
Lawrence. The film stars Peter O Toole in the title role. It was directed by
David Lean and produced by Sam Spiegel, from a script by Robert Bolt and Michael
Wilson  Lean and Spiegel had recently completed the acclaimed film, [[The Bridge
on the River Kwai]] . It is widely considered one of the greatest and most
influential films in the history of filmmaking. The dramatic score by Maurice
Jarre, and Super Panavision 70 cinematography by Freddie Young, are also hugely
acclaimed.

The film depicts Lawrence s experiences in Arabia during World War I, in
particular his attacks on Aqaba and Damascus and his involvement in the Arab
National Council. Its themes include Lawrence s emotional struggles with
violence in war  especially the conflicts between Arabic tribes and the
slaughter of the Turkish army , his personal identity   Who are you?  is a
recurring line throughout the film , and his divided allegiance between his
native Britain and its army, and his newfound comrades within the Arabian desert
tribes. The film is unusual in having no women in speaking roles.

Synopsis

The film opens with Lawrence  O Toole  as a civilian, riding his motorcycle down
a narrow English country road only to be killed when he tries to avoid a
collision with a couple of bicyclists. His funeral is staged at St. Paul s
Cathedral. Reporters try to gain insights into this remarkable, but enigmatic
man, from people who knew him but with little success.


The movie then flashes back to Cairo during World War I, where Lawrence is a
misfit British lieutenant, notable only for his insolence and knowledge of the
Bedouin. Over the objections of a sceptical General Murray  Donald Wolfit , he
is sent by Mr. Dryden  Claude Rains  of the Arab Bureau to assess the prospects
of Prince Feisal  Alec Guinness  in his revolt against the Turks, allies of the
Germans.

On his journey, his Bedouin guide is killed by Sherif Ali  Omar Sharif  for
drinking from his well without permission. Just outside Faisal s camp, he
encounters his superior officer, Colonel Brighton  Anthony Quayle , who orders
him to keep quiet, make his assessment and then leave. He promptly ignores these
commands when he meets Feisal. His fine intellect and outspokeness piques the
prince s interest.

Brighton advises the Arab leader to retreat after a major defeat, but Lawrence
proposes an alternative, an attack on Aqaba. If taken, the town would provide a
port from which the British could offload much needed supplies for the
rebellion, but it is too strongly guarded against a naval assault. However,
Lawrence proposes an assault on the lightly defended landward side. He convinces
Faisal to provide fifty camel cavalry, led by Sherif Ali. As they prepare to
leave, two teenage orphan boys, Daud  John Dimech  and Farraj  Michel Ray ,
attach themselves to Lawrence as his servants. They cross the Nefud Desert,
considered impassable even by the Bedouins, travelling day and ni</STYLE>
