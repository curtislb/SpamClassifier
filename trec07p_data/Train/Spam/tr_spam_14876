I am writing you in absolute confidence primarily to
seek your assistance to transfer they cash of Four
Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($4;500.000)now
in the confidence account in Cote d'Ivoire 

SOURCE OF THE MONEY.     My late Father, Dr Ibrahim
Mohamed  a native of mende District in the Northern
province of SierraLeone, was the General Manager of
Sierra Leone Mining co-operation (S.L.M.C.) Freetown .


According to my Father, this money was the income
accrued from Mining.Co-operation’s over draft and
minor sales. Before the peak of the civil war between
the rebels forces of Major Paul Koroma and the
combined forces of ECOMOG peace keeping operation that
almost destroyed my country, following the forceful
removal from power of the civilian elected President
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah bythe rebels. 

My father had already made arrangement for me  to be
evacuated to Benin Republic with the Lodgment Receipt
he made with the  bank through the aid of UN
evacuation team.  During the war in my country, and
following the indiscriminate  looting of Public and
Government properties by the rebel forces, the Sierra
Leone mining coop. Was one of the target looted and
destroyed. 

My father  including other top Government
functionaries were attached and killed by the rebels
in November 2001 because of his relationship with the
civilian Government of Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, May His
Gentle Soul Rest In Peace,

As a result of my father’s death , and with the news
of my father’s youger brother involvement in the air
crash in March 2003 dashed my hope of survival. The
untimely deaths caused my Mother’s heart failure and
other related complications of which she later died in
the hospital after we must have spent a lot of money
on her ending of last year .     

I am  alone in this strange country suffering without
any care or help. Without any relation, I am now like
refugee .My only hope now is in you and I beg that you
will never betray Me, because this money is the final
hope I have.  To this effect, I humbly solicit your
assistance in the followings ways.- 

To help me forward your account  and contact the bank
so that   this  money  will be transfered into your
private account  for investment purpose- 

To make a good arrangement for a joint business
investment on our behalf in your country and you, My
Adviser/ Manager. 

For your assistance, I  have agreed that 20% of the
total amount will be for your effort .  

Last, I urge you to keep this transaction strictly
confidential as no one knows my where about.
