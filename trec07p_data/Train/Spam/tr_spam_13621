NOTE: You are reading this note because your email program does not
support messages in multi-part "MIME" format (you can see the plain
text version of the message, but the HTML version is garbled).  The 
best solution to this problem is to upgrade to an email program that
supports MIME.  If you can't do that, then just ignore the part
of this message that is improperly displayed by your current email
program.
