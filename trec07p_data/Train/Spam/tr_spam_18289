<center> <=21--Alan Boss, who works at the Carnegie Institution of Washington where a U.S=
=2E team of astronomers competed in the hunt for an Earth-like planet, called it =22a major mi=
lestone in this business.=22

The planet was discovered by the European Southern Observatory's telescope in La Silla, C=
hile, which has a special instrument that splits light to find wobbles in different wave le=
ngths. Those wobbles can reveal the existence of other worlds.

What they revealed is a planet circling the red dwarf star, Gliese 581. Red dwarfs are low-e=
nergy, tiny stars that give off dim red light and last longer than stars like our sun. Until a=
 few years ago, astronomers didn't consider these stars as possible hosts of planets that m=
ight sustain life.

The discovery of the new planet, named 581 c, is sure to fuel studies of planets circling sim=
ilar dim stars. About 80 percent of the stars near Earth are red dwarfs.

The new planet is about five times heavier than Earth. Its discoverers aren't certain if it=
 is rocky like Earth or if its a frozen ice ball with liquid water on the surface. If it is rocky=
 like Earth, which is what the prevailing theory proposes, it has a diameter about 1 1/2 time=
s bigger than our planet. If it is an iceball, as Mayor suggests, it would be even bigger.

Based on theory, 581 c should have an atmosphere, but what's in that atmosphere is still a my=
stery and if it's too thick that could make the planet's surface temperature too hot, Mayor=
 said.
