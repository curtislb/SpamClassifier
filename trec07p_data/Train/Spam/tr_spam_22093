History n king, Sudan.]]


Early history of Sudan

Archaeological evidence has confirmed that the area in the north of Sudan was
inhabited at least sixty thousand years ago. A settled culture appeared in the
area around 8000 nbsp BC, living in fortified mud brick villages, where they
subsisted on hunting and fishing, as well as grain gathering and cattle herding.
Skeletal remains suggest that a blending of negroid and Mediterranean
populations occurred during the Neolithic period  eighth to third
millenia nbsp BC  and has remained relatively stable until today in northern
Sudan.

The area was known to the Egyptians as Kush and had strong cultural and
religious ties to Egypt. In the eighth century nbsp BC, however, Kush came under
the rule of an aggressive line of monarchs, ruling from the capital city,
Napata, who gradually extended their influence into Egypt. About 750 nbsp BC, a
Cushite king called Kashta conquered Upper Egypt and became ruler of Thebes
until approximately 740 nbsp BC. His successor, Piankhy, subdued the delta,
reunited Egypt under the Twenty fifth Dynasty, and founded a line of kings who
ruled Cush and Thebes for about a hundred years. The dynasty s intervention in
the area of modern Syria caused a confrontation between Egypt and Assyria. When
the Assyrians in retaliation invaded Egypt, Taharqa  688 663 nbsp BC , the last
Cushite pharaoh, withdrew and returned the dynasty to Napata, where it continued
to rule Cush and extended its dominions to the south and east.

In 590 nbsp BC, an Egyptian army sacked Napata, compelling the Cushite court to
move to Meroe near the sixth cataract. The Meroitic kingdom subsequently
developed independently of Egypt, and during the height of its power in the
second and third centuries nbsp BC, Meroe extended over a region from the third
cataract in the north to Sawba, near present day Khartoum  the modern day
capital of Sudan .

The pharaonic tradition persisted among Meroe s rulers , who raised stelae to
record the achievements of their reigns and erected pyramids to contain their
tombs. These objects and the ruins of palaces, temples, and baths at Meroe
attest to a centralized political system that employed artisans  skills and
commanded the labor of a large work force. A well managed irrigation system
allowed the area to support a higher population density than was possible during
later periods. By the first century nbsp BC, the use of hieroglyphs gave way to
a Meroitic script that adapted the Egyptian writing system to an indigenous, Nubian 
related language spoken later by the region s people.

In the second century nbsp AD, the people known as the Nobatae occupied the
Nile s west bank in northern Cush. eventually they intermarried and established
themselves among the Meroitic people as a military aristocracy. Until nearly the
fifth century, Rome subsidized the Nobatae and used Meroe as a buffer between
Egypt and the Blemmyes. About AD nbsp 350, an Axumite army from Abbyssinia
captured and destroyed Meroe city, ending the kingdom s independent existence.

Christian Kingdoms By the sixth century, three states had emerged as the
political and cultural heirs of the Meroitic kingdom. Nobatia in the north, also
known as Ballanah, had its capital at Faras, in what is now Egypt  the central
kingdom, Muqurra  Makuria , was centered at Dunqulah, about 150 kilometers south
of modern Dunqulah  and Alawa  Alodia , in the heartland of old Meroe, which had
its capital at Sawba  now a suburb of modern day Khartoum . In all three
kingdoms, warrior aristocracies ruled Meroitic populations from royal courts
where functionaries bore Greek titles in emulation of the Byzantine court.

A missionary sent by Byzantine empress Theodora arrived in Nobatia and started
preaching the gospel about 540. The Nubian kings became Monophysite Christians,
However, Makuria,was of the Melkite Christian faith, unlike Nobatia an</STYLE>
