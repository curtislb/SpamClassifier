<P>Dear Memo,</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is such a wonderful time of the year when an=
ything seems possible.  I'm sure you are busy making plans for all the thing=
s you want to do over the coming months. I've been studying my charts, Memo =
and I can see immediately that we are on the brink of a new era when you wil=
l enjoy all the happiness and prosperity you could wish for. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Believe me, I'm thrilled that you'll be able to f=
ulfill so many of your dreams, whether it's taking the trip of a lifetime, o=
wning that car you've always fantasized about or simply feeling so happy tha=
t you'll wonder if this really is your life and you aren't going to wake up =
and discover it was all just a dream! Well, rest assured Memo because <u>200=
7 is going to be a momentous year for you.</u></P>

<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact Memo, now that we've been working togeth=
er for 2 weeks, I believe that this new era will be the turning point.&nbsp;=
 Yes, I truly feel that you are about to realize that your destiny is one of=
 happiness and prosperity and that worries about money, relationships and he=
alth are about to become a thing of the past.</TD>

<P align=3Dcenter><B>Cosmic Forces Could Delay Your Success, Memo</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is just one concern I have Memo. Throughout=
 the rest of year, there will be some rather difficult astrological energy t=
hat, if you let it, could delay or even block your happiness. The truth is M=
emo, the Cosmos likes to play tricks on us from time to time.&nbsp; It offer=
s us untold riches but it also tests our desire to accept those riches.&nbsp=
;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take a moment to explain myself.&nbsp; We =
humans are complex creatures.&nbsp; We think we know exactly what we want bu=
t then self doubt or outside influences intervene and we wind up believing t=
hat we didn't deserve to triumph after all.&nbsp; Maybe you were sidelined i=
nstead of gaining that promotion that really should have been a sure thing.&=
nbsp; Perhaps you saved enough money to begin those home improvements you pl=
anned only to find a huge bill in your mailbox.&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It only takes one or two things to go wrong and i=
t's all too easy to let yourself fall into a negative mindset that can spira=
l out of control.&nbsp; I know, Memo that you have had more than your fair s=
hare of heartache.&nbsp; But that doesn't have to continue, Memo.&nbsp; Ever=
ything that you want really is there for you...</P>
<P><B>Don't you think now that you are 34 it's time to embrace the happiness=
 and good fortune that you've always thought was just out of reach?</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well I certainly do Memo and I have thought long =
and hard about how I can help you to fulfill your dreams and reach your goal=
s.&nbsp; As you know I spend a lot of my time studying age-old mystical prac=
tices so that I can bring the wisdom of the past into the present and pave t=
he way for you to enjoy the contentment and prosperity that you so richly de=
serve.&nbsp;</P>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>Simplicity Itself</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was overjoyed when I hit upon an astoundingly s=
imple way of preventing harmful influences from affecting you and at the sam=
e time attracting happiness and prosperity into your life.&nbsp; I realized =
that by putting together a unique combination of powerful items I could crea=
te a way for you to block out the kind of negative vibrations that hinder th=
e flow of good fortune that is yours by right.</P>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>The Magical Power of the Ringstone</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mystical tradition has always sought ways to ward=
 off mischievous elements and attract only positive vibrations.&nbsp; One an=
cient method was to use a Ringstone.&nbsp; These strange stones are formed b=
y running water, its action creating the hole in the center of the stone.&nb=
sp; Placing one in your home or around your neck was considered ideal protec=
tion against bad luck...</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Memo, I decided to create for you the<B> Psyc=
hic Protection Kit</B> based around this powerful Talisman.&nbsp;</P>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>Snowflake Obsidian: Charged With Psychic Power</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memo, I searched until I found the perfect materi=
al for your Ringstones.&nbsp; I chose Snowflake Obsidian, a beautiful and un=
usual stone.&nbsp; The dark of the volcanic crystal contrasts with the white=
 of the hardened ash "snowflakes" glistening in the stone.&nbsp; But in this=
 crystal, there is much more than beauty alone -- Snowflake Obsidian has a w=
ell-earned reputation for providing psychic protection.&nbsp;</P>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>Cutting Through Deception and Danger</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember, Memo, that I mentioned outside influenc=
es could have an affect on your chances of reaching your heart's desire.... =
One important quality of Snowflake Obsidian is its ability to slice through =
deception and bring to the surface the truth, whether positive or negative.&=
nbsp; Therefore wearing it enhances your self awareness and sharpens your in=
tuition, allowing you to steer clear of unpleasant or dangerous situations.&=
nbsp; You'll see immediately when someone is trying to pull the wool over yo=
ur eyes or wants you to fail. Memo, you will be so "tuned in" that you'll in=
stinctively know who you can trust and who you must steer clear of at all co=
sts.&nbsp;</P>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>A Psychic Insurance Policy For Your Home and Family</B>=
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is even more to this <B>Psychic Protect=
ion Kit</B> than simply a Ringstone to wear.&nbsp; In olden days, Ringstones=
 were nailed to gateposts or over the door to deter unwelcome visitors and p=
rotect the home from harm.&nbsp; This charm has unusual power and placing on=
e in your own home will ensure that a strong signal is sent out to the Unive=
rse that you, Memo are not prepared to allow in any negative or troublesome =
energy.&nbsp; I know that you have worked long and hard for what you have go=
t that there is no way you are going to allow it to be damaged!</P>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>Ancient Rituals That Are Still Valid Today</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All mystical practice involves rituals. That's wh=
y I have written a booklet, especially for you, which is included in the <b>=
Psychic Protection Kit</b>. It provides step by step, easy to follow instruc=
tions to maximize the power of the Ringstones.  At certain times of the year=
, the Universe is especially open to messages from us.  You can ask for what=
 you want and be confident that the Universe will do its best to provide it.=
 One of these important periods is coming up on May 10th and it is essential=
 that you have everything in place to take advantage of it.

<P align=3Dcenter><B>Salt: White Gold</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may wonder Memo why such a commonplace ingred=
ient as salt is included in the <B>Psychic Protection Kit</B>.&nbsp; In reli=
gious ritual, salt is used for cleansing and purification and in fact the wo=
rd "salvation" is derived from "salt".&nbsp; Not only that but Salt was so v=
aluable to the ancient Mayans because of its ability to purify and preserve =
that they called it "White Gold".</P>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>Candle Magic, Spiritual, Powerful and Simple</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Candles are a cornerstone of magic.&nbsp; They ar=
e a simple yet potent way to banish negativity and attract healing energy.&n=
bsp; Candles symbolize your intent, that you, Memo are only willing to accep=
t positive energy into your life.&nbsp; The black and white of the Snowflake=
 Obsidian is echoed in the black and white candles.&nbsp; In mystical ritual=
s, burning a black candle absorbs and dispels harmful vibrations.&nbsp; Whit=
e represents purity and burning a white candle clears obstacles from your pa=
th allowing the energy of the Cosmos to fill your life with joy.</P>

/B></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may remember Memo, I mentioned difficult plan=
etary energy during 2007?  Let me tell you why I am so concerned. The major =
planets are lining up in an extraordinary fashion throughout the year, creat=
ing an atmosphere that may be disturbing.  For example, in July,  Jupiter, n=
ormally the  planet of wealth, growth, and good fortune, will be at odds wit=
h unsettling  Uranus, which can bring  unexpected setbacks. This actually co=
ntinues until the end of the year, in a way symbolically  creating brick wal=
ls that block the harmonious movement of energy. There are many other planet=
ary configurations through 2007 waiting to trip you up.</P>
