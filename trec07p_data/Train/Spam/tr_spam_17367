<center><=21--It was the single deadliest attack on ground forces since Dec. 1, 2005, whe=
n a roadside bomb killed 10 Marines and wounded 11 on a foot patrol near Fallujah.

Twelve soldiers died when a Black Hawk helicopter crashed in Diyala on Jan. 20. The militar=
y said it might have been shot down but the investigation is still ongoing.

In other devastating attacks, 14 Marines were killed when a roadside bomb struck an amphib=
ious assault vehicle near the western town of Haditha on Aug. 3, 2005. And a suicide bomber s=
truck a mess tent in a base near Mosul on Dec. 21, 2004, killing 22 people, including 14 U.S. s=
oldiers and three American contractors.

At least 68 Iraqis were killed or found dead Monday, according to police, including 10 in a s=
uicide car bombing against a police station in the Diyala provincial capital of Baqouba.

With the U.S. casualty toll mounting, Democratic leaders in Washington agreed Monday on l=
egislation that requires the first American combat troops to be withdrawn from Iraq by Oct=
=2E 1 with a goal of a complete pullout six months later. Bush has promised to veto any such meas=
ure as the legislative confrontation intensifies.

U.S. officials, meanwhile, signaled that they might reconsider putting a three-mile con=
crete barrier around a Sunni Arab neighborhood in Baghdad after Iraq's struggling prime m=
inister came under pressure from Sunnis and ordered construction of the wall halted.
