 Merlin  is best known as the wizard featured in Arthurian legend. The standard
depiction of the character first appears in Geoffrey of Monmouth s [[Historia
Regum Britanniae]], and is based on an amalgamation of previous historical and
legendary figures. Geoffrey combined existing stories of Myrddin Wyllt  Merlinus
Caledonensis , a northern madman with no connection to King Arthur, with tales
of Aurelius Ambrosius to form the figure he called  Merlin Ambrosius .

Geoffrey s version of the character was immediately popular, and later writers
expanded the account to produce a fuller image of the wizard. His traditional
biography has him born the son of an incubus and a mortal woman who inherits his
powers from his strange birth. ref Katharine Briggs  1976  An Encyclopedia of
Fairies, Hobgoblins, Brownies, Boogies, and Other Supernatural Creatures. New
York, Pantheon Books.  Wizards  p.440 ISBN 0 394 73467 X   ref  He grows up to
be a sage and engineers the birth of Arthur through magic. Later Merlin serves
as the king s advisor until he is bewitched and imprisoned by the Lady of the
Lake.

s, as illustrated in a French book from the 13th century.]]

Geoffrey s sources Geoffrey s composite Merlin is based primarily on two
figures  Myrddin Wyllt, also called Merlinus Caledonensis, and Aurelius
Ambrosius, a highly fictionalized version of the historical war leader Ambrosius
Aurelianus. The former had nothing to do with Arthur and flourished after the
Arthurian period. Supposedly a bard who went mad after witnessing the horrors of
war, he was said to have fled civilization to become a Wildman of the Woods in
the late 6th century. Geoffrey had this individual in mind when he wrote his
earliest surviving work, the Prophetiae Merlini  Prophecies of Merlin , which he
claimed were the actual words of the legendary madman. Medievalist Gaston Paris
suggested he altered the name to  Merlinus  rather than the standard
romanization  Merdinus  to avoid a resemblance to the obscene French word merde,
meaning  shit .

Geoffrey s Prophetiae do not reveal much about Merlin s background. When he
included the prophet in his next work, Historia Regum Britanniae, he
supplemented the characterization with stories about Aurelius Ambrosius, taken
from Nennius  [[Historia Brittonum]]. According to Nennius, Ambrosius was
discovered when the British king Vortigern was trying to erect a tower. The
tower always collapsed before completion, and his wise men told him the only
solution was to sprinkle the foundation with the blood of a  child born without
a father . Ambrosius was rumored to be such a child, but when brought before the
king, he revealed the real reason for the tower s collapse  below the foundation
was a lake containing two dragons who destroyed the tower by fighting.

Geoffrey retells this story in Historia Regum Britanniae with some
embellishments, and gives the fatherless child the name of the prophetic bard,
Merlin. He keeps this new figure separate from Aurelius Ambrosius, and to
disguise his changing of Nennius, he simply and baldly states that Ambrosius was
another name for Merlin. He goes on to add new episodes that tie Merlin into the
story of King Arthur and his predecessors.

Geoffrey dealt with Merlin again in his third work, Vita Merlini. He based the
Vita on stories of the original 6th century Myrddin. Though set long after his
timeframe for the life of  Merlin Ambrosius , he tries to assert the characters
are the same with references to King Arthur and his death as told in the
Historia Regum Britanniae.

Merlinus Caledonensis Myrddin Wyllt

The earliest  pre 12th century  Welsh poems concerning the Myrddin legend
present him as a madman living a wretched existence in the Caledonian Forest,
ruminating on his former existence and the disaster that brought him low  the
death of his lord Gwenddoleu, whom he served as bard. The allusions in these
poems serve to sketch out the events of the Battle of Arfderydd, where Riderch
Hael, King of Alt Clut  Strathclyde  slaughtered the forces of Gwenddoleu, and
Myrddin went mad watching this defeat. The [[Annales Cambriae]] date this battle
to AD 573, and name Gwenddoleu s adversaries as the sons of Eliffer, presumably
Gwrgi and Peredur.

A version of this legend is preserved in a late 15th century manuscript, in a
story called Lailoken and Kentigern. In this narrative, Saint Kentigern meets in
a deserted place with a naked, hairy madman who is called Lailoken, although
said by some to be called Merlynum or  Merlin , who declares that he has been
condemned for his sins to wander in the company of beasts. He added that he had
been the cause for the deaths of all of the persons killed in the battle fought
 on the plain between Liddel and Carwannok.  Having told his story, the madman
lept up and fled from the presence of the saint back into the wilderness. He
appears several times more in the narrative until at last asking Kentigern for
the sacrament, prophesying that he was about to die a triple death. After some
hesitation, the saint granted the madman s wish, and later that day the
shepherds of King Meldred captured him, beat him with clubs, then cast him into
the River Tweed where his body was pierced by a stake, thus fulfilling his
prophecy.

Welsh literature has many examples of a prophetic literature, predicting the
military victory of all of the Celtic peoples of Great Britain who will join
together and drive the English     and</STYLE>
