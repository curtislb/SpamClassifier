 Southampton  is a city, unitary authority and major port situated on the south
coast of England. It is the closest city to the New Forest, situated
approximately halfway between Portsmouth and Bournemouth. Southampton lies at
the northern most point of Southampton Water where it is joined by the River
Test and River Itchen, with the River Hamble joining to the south of the urban
area. The city represents the core of the Greater Southampton region. The city s
name is sometimes abbreviated in writing to  Soton , and a resident of
Southampton is called a .

History

]] ]]

.]] Although Stone Age settlements are known to have existed in the area, the
first permanent settlement was established by the Romans. Known as Clausentum,
it was an important trading port for the large Roman towns of Winchester and
Salisbury. The Anglo Saxons moved the centre of the town across the Itchen to
its present location, and it remained an important port. At the time, it was
centred around what is now the St Mary s area, and the settlement was known as
Hamwic, which evolved into Hamtun and then Hampton. The Viking King Canute the
Great is supposed to have defeated the Anglo Saxon King Ethelred the Unready
here in 1014 and been crowned here, and his fabled attempt to  command  the tide
to halt may have taken place in Southampton.

Southampton s prosperity was assured following the Norman Conquest in 1066, when
it became the major port of transit between Winchester  then the capital of
England  and Normandy. By the 13th Century, Southampton had become a leading
port, and was particularly involved in the wool trade. The Wool House was built
in 1417 as a warehouse for the medieval wool trade with Flanders and Italy, the
building surviving today as the Maritime Museum. During the Middle Ages,
shipbuilding became an increasingly important industry, which was to remain for
centuries to come.

The town was sacked in 1338 by the French, including the pirate Grimaldi, who
used the plunder to help found the principality of Monaco. After this attack,
the city walls were built, some of which remain as ruins today. Lacking proper
finance for the construction of a full defensive wall, the townsfolk reached a
compromise solution, which involved joining the existing exterior walls of
existing merchant houses together to form part of the defensive structure. The
city walls include God s House Tower, built in 1417, the first purpose built
artillery fortification in England. Today, it is open as the Museum of
Archaeology.

The 12th century Red Lion pub on the High Street, within the old walls, is where
in 1415, immediately prior to King Henry V of England s departure from
Southampton to the Battle of Agincourt, the ringleaders of the  Southampton
Plot , Richard, Earl of Cambridge, Henry Scrope, 3rd Baron Scrope of Masham and
Sir Thomas Grey of Heton, were tried and found guilty of high treason, before
being summarily executed outside the Bargate.

The port was the original point of departure for the Pilgrim Fathers aboard the
[[Mayflower]] in 1623. A memorial can be found on Town Quay. Since that time it
has been the last port of call for millions of emigrants who left the Old World
to start a new life in the USA, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and
other parts of the world. In common with most of the luxury liners of the time,
the RMS   Titanic   sailed from here, and it is still an important ocean liner
port frequented by luxury ships such as the RMS   QE2  , the MV   Oriana  , and
most recently the   Queen Mary 2  . The town contains several memorials and
museum exhibitions related to the Titanic, most of crew having come from
Southampton  549 Sotonians died in the sinking.

The city is home to Sir Edwin Lutyens  first permanent cenotaph, a memorial to
the city s dead of World War I. When it was unveiled on 6 November 1920, it was
1800 names, later raised to 2008. The Second World War hit Southampton
