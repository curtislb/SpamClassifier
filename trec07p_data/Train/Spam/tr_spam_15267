        Investors Turn a 25&cent; Investment 
        into $89 On a Daily Basis </h1>
      <p>SUMMARY:</p>
      <ul style="list-style-image:url(file:///Data/creative/Archive-Web/VGFA/html_emails/vgfa_smartest_investors/checked_box.gif); margin-left:25px;">
        <li> Vanguard&rsquo;s average investor tripled his or her portfolio value over the last 15 years.</li>
        <li><b>But a group of risk-averse Vanguard investors grew their portfolios<br>

      <h3 align="center" style="font-size:14pt;">If you are holding any of Vanguard&rsquo;s most popular funds, <br>
        you could be doomed to mediocrity, or worse, this year.</h3>
      <h2 align="center" style="font-size:18pt;"> Cut Your Risks and Still Make 136% More <br>
        Money Than the Average Vanguard Investor </h2>
      <p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The average Vanguard investor</span> has
          more than tripled his or her personal pot of gold since 1991. A portfolio starting with $100,000 is now worth $384,095. That&rsquo;s the <u>average</u>.
          And many might say that&rsquo;s a darn good reason to invest with Vanguard.</p>
      <p>But during that exact same time, investors who took my advice on Vanguard saw their personal pots of gold grow not three but <u>EIGHT TIMES
            LARGER</u>.</p>
      <p>My name is Dan Wiener and some say I have the Midas Touch when it comes to Vanguard&rsquo;s funds. Seems every fund I recommend surges beyond
        expectations. Lucky? Not really. I&rsquo;ve been picking the perfect Vanguard funds for nearly 20 years and I&rsquo;m doing it again right now!</p>

            <p>But if you&rsquo;re holding Vanguard&rsquo;s most popular funds, your profit surge won&rsquo;t happen. This Briefing tells you why you&rsquo;re
              better off selling those funds today, and how this year, you can more than double your profits with a fraction of the risk you&rsquo;re taking
              now.</p></td>

      </table>
      <p>It might seem I&rsquo;m bragging a bit. But I&rsquo;m just giving the facts. The same $100,000 that the average Vanguard investor grew to $384,095
        pales compared to the $905,530 that investors who followed my advice would have.</p>
      <p>We (my subscribers and I) did it all with Vanguard funds. Yes, a profit of $805,530. That&rsquo;s $521,435 <u>more profit</u> than Vanguard&rsquo;s
        average investor. Staggering. And sad, because the facts show that the average Vanguard investor, and you might be among them, is missing out on
        $32,589.69 each year in profits. </p>
      <p>Every year you stay with Vanguard&rsquo;s most popular funds is costing you plenty, my friend. But I&rsquo;m not writing to you today to tell
        a sad tale. </p>
      <p>I&rsquo;m going to lift your Vanguard profits dramatically. And at the same time, I&rsquo;m going to cut your risks, slash your unnecessary investment
        costs and tell you how to get more out of your Vanguard funds. </p>

Well, I&rsquo;m about to reveal 19 Vanguard secrets that will put you on the right path. But first, let me get some necessary business out

      <p>That <u>extra</u> $32,589.69 Vanguard profit I deliver each year (about $89 a day in extra profits) to members can be yours for about 25&cent; a
        day. That&rsquo;s the cost of my investment advisory service.</p>
      <p>Think of what this could mean to you. When every 25&cent; you spend turns into $89&mdash;day after day, year after year&mdash;your life changes. </p>

      <p>Vanguard became famous for indexing, but index investors do not become as rich as my members do. What&rsquo;s worse is index investors have no
        idea how risky those funds can be. And risk is the enemy. Controlling risks is probably one of the top reasons you&rsquo;re investing in mutual
        funds. But what you are about to discover will shock you. </p>

          large-cap stocks. In fact, during the last bear market investors lost more than <i>$40 billion</i> in this fund.</b></p>
      <p>500 Index has more risk built into it than Vanguard wants you to know about. Diversified? Risk free? Below-average risk? Think again, my friend.</p>

      <p>A whopping 26% of the fund&rsquo;s assets are tied up in just 10 stocks, and nearly half (49%) of its assets are invested in just three sectors.
        What&rsquo;s more, 500 Index took an eternity&mdash;six years&mdash;to recover from the tech implosion. In fact, investors just barely got back
        to even in December of 2006. </p>

      <p style="margin-top: 0px;"><b>Vanguard has a fund that&rsquo;s remarkably close to the 500 Index, except it&rsquo;s safer, performs better, and it&rsquo;s
          actively managed!</b></p>
      <p>If you want to invest along with the S&amp;P 500, fine. But you&rsquo;ll be much better off when you do it with a fund that can weed out the dogs

      <p>Vanguard has such a fund, and members of the Fund Family Shareholder Association (or FFSA, the organization I created in 1990 to help investors
        get richer, faster in their mutual funds) know all about it. This fund holds just 120 stocks. 65% of its assets are in stocks that are included
        in 500 Index (the best of the 500). The other 35% of its assets are put to work in other areas. And that&rsquo;s where this fund&rsquo;s professional
        management skills prove their worth.</p>

        you&rsquo;re indexing to get it, well you&rsquo;re making a costly mistake, one that traps the average Vanguard investor time and time again and
        costs them up to 40% in profits year after year.</p>
      <p>Please don&rsquo;t lose 40% of your profits this year. <a href="http://confirm.investorplace.com/c/conf?CRVGFASVIT-3317975-7XA153-7XA153">Join FFSA today</a>. Do not wait for Vanguard to tell you that indexing is last century&rsquo;s
        way to profit safely. They will never reveal this fact to you.</p>
      <p>Indexing is failing now. From 2000 to 2005, Vanguard&rsquo;s index funds were down a collective 13.3%. But during that same five-year time frame,
        the funds I recommended to FFSA members were up 17.9%&mdash;with 13% less risk!</p>

      <p>After posting gains of 44.5% in 2003 and 20.1% in 2004, Vanguard closed their only truly global stock fund. But in August of 2005, it re-opened
        and kept a standard low minimum ($3,000) to get in. What&rsquo;s more, and this may shock you, this actively-managed global fund has about <u>half</u> the
        risk of 500 Index. </p>
      <p>Once you become a member of FFSA and start receiving our private advisory, you&rsquo;ll see that this fund plays a major role in our Growth Model
        portfolio. </p>
      <p>As I said, this global fund is now open once again to new investors. But who knows? It could slam its doors shut again without notice at any moment.

      <p>What about Health Care? Does it have a clone? Yes! But many investors (non-members of FFSA, that is) fall into a trap seeking a Health Care clone.
        The unknowing assume that Vanguard&rsquo;s Health Care Index Fund is a good alternative. But it is not!</p>
      <p>First off, Health Care Index has a minimum initial investment of $100,000. With such a steep entry fee, it&rsquo;s all but closed to most investors
        anyway. Second, it both underperforms Vanguard&rsquo;s managed Health Care fund and has a higher risk as well. Not a good combo.</p>

        is not a Vanguard fund doesn&rsquo;t stop me from recommending it to FFSA members, especially when there&rsquo;s no stopping the demands for health
        care.</p>
      <p>More than 25% of our 300 million population (78 million of us!) are just now entering the phase of their lives when health care becomes the most

      <p>While it&rsquo;s not quite true that the higher the minimum initial investment the lower the returns, it&rsquo;s pretty darn close to being true. </p>

      <p>Caution should also be exercised before you go chasing after Energy and Precious Metals. Those two sector funds have been Vanguard&rsquo;s biggest

        but speculation.</p>

      <p>Vanguard won&rsquo;t steer you away from any of their variable annuities, but they should forbid you from buying some of them.</p>
      <p>You see, Vanguard&rsquo;s annuity funds are tax-deferred clones of other funds. Buying one for your 401(k) is a costly mistake. Annuities are
        expensive when compared to the underlying funds they mimic and there is absolutely no reason for you to have an annuity in an account that&rsquo;s
        already tax advantaged.</p>
      <p><a href="http://confirm.investorplace.com/c/conf?CRVGFASVIT-3317975-7XA153-7XA153"><img src="http://images.investorplace.com/e_images/vgfa/smartest/signupnow.gif" width="178" height="50" border="0" align="right"></a>Since they are more expensive than their underlying funds, annuity returns are almost always subpar. I said &ldquo;almost.&rdquo; </p>
      <p>And it&rsquo;s not like the underlying fund, Windsor II, is a dog. It has rewarded investors with returns of 61.9% over the last five years. Still,
        the annuity fund did even better&mdash;70.7%.</p>
      <p>The manager of this annuity is Jim Barrow, one of Vanguard&rsquo;s all-time best equity fund managers. The underlying fund, Windsor II, is run
        by a host of different managers. But Mr. Barrow runs this annuity all by himself.</p>

      <p>No matter which type of fund fits your investment objectives the best, you&rsquo;re looking for the safety of diversification. That&rsquo;s why
        you turn to mutual funds, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
      <p>Bet you didn&rsquo;t realize that 13 of Vanguard&rsquo;s growth funds have the exact same top-10 holdings. So, if you own two growth funds, chances
        are you&rsquo;re overexposed on those stocks. Overlapping investments, which is the opposite of diversification, is a trap far too many Vanguard
        investors fall into. </p>
      <p>In 2005, Vanguard introduced Diversified Equity, to help investors achieve favorable diversification easily. It&rsquo;s a fund made up of other
        funds.</p>
      <p>The core of the fund is Growth &amp; Income, which is just about as close as you can get to 500 Index. </p>
      <p>Diversified Equity also includes Windsor and Windsor II, U.S. Growth and Morgan Growth, Capital Value and MidCap Growth. So yes, Vanguard does
        reach a degree of diversification with that mix.</p>

      <p>But still, in the end, Diversified Equity isn&rsquo;t much better than a straight total-market index fund. You simply don&rsquo;t get the safety
        you seek from Diversified Equity, no matter what Vanguard&rsquo;s marketing might say. FFSA members know to avoid this disappointing fund. </p>

      <p>Can you imagine Vanguard telling you <u>not</u> to sink a large amount of money into any taxable fund late in the year? </p>
      <p>Funds normally pay out capital gains at the end of the year. Why should you pay taxes on gains realized before you got on board? So please, do
        not buy just prior to a fund&rsquo;s distribution date. Wait until the beginning of the year, or at least until after distributions are made. The
        money you&rsquo;ll save on taxes adds up and goes directly to your bottom line.</p>
      <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 12pt;font-weight: bold;text-transform: uppercase;margin-bottom: 0px;padding-bottom: 0px;"><u>VANGUARD SECRET #17</u></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0px;"><b>You can save on taxes and penalties by NOT automatically reinvesting your distributions.</b></p>
      <p>Generally, automatically reinvesting capital gains distributions is a fine idea, but this practice can lead to a higher tax bill if you&rsquo;re
        the kind of investor who rebalances your portfolio from time to time.</p>
      <p>Buying more shares of a fund could conflict with rebalancing decisions that say you should be scaling back a bit. This will only lead you to a
        bigger tax bite, since you&rsquo;d have to sell some of your automatically reinvested shares. And if a back-end load is involved, then you could
        find yourself paying that penalty as well.</p>
      <p>What should you do with your capital gains distributions? Have them directly deposited into your money market account. You&rsquo;ll still pay
        taxes on your distributions, but now you&rsquo;ve given yourself the flexibility of moving that extra cash into the funds your rebalancing decisions
        say need beefing up.</p>

        never seen anything like it before.</p>
      <p>This gift alone gives you more than 225 pages of advice, analysis, facts, and figures on more than 100 Vanguard funds. Each fund is broken down
        so that you fully understand what a fund does, who&rsquo;s running the show, and most important&mdash;why you should or shouldn&rsquo;t own it.</p>
      <p>Each profiled fund gets a full page of in-depth coverage, showing you information&mdash;at a glance&mdash;you can&rsquo;t find anywhere else. </p>
      <p>You&rsquo;ll be amazed at how many fund facts you get and you&rsquo;ll be amazed at how fast you get them. You learn levels of risk, performance
        over the long and short term, and my own take on the fund, including my personal buy or sell recommendation.</p>
      <p>Go to the back of this guide and you&rsquo;ll find special sections revealing even more important facts in an easy-to-use, easy-to-understand
        format, facts you may never discover on your own (unless you get this book), including:</p>
      <ul style="list-style-image:url(file:///Data/creative/Archive-Web/VGFA/html_emails/vgfa_smartest_investors/check.gif);">

        <li>The oldest and newest funds, some of which may deserve your dollars, and some of which don&rsquo;t.</li>
        <li>Funds ranked by risk. Need I say more?</li>
        <li>Funds ranked by turnover. A good start when looking for funds that won&rsquo;t cost you more in taxes than they earn in returns.</li>
        <li>Funds ranked by operating expenses.</li>
        <li>Funds ranked by performance. </li>
        <li>The place where the investment rubber meets the road.</li>
        <li>And an ingenious fund correlations chart that will keep you from overloading on one type of investment rather than diversifying the way the
          most successful investors do. Let me explain.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This correlations chart shows you how closely the performance of one fund tracks that of another. All you need to do is apply a quick glance at
        the chart.</p>
      <p>Use this chart to make sure you do not have overlapping investments. Use it to make sure you reach the level of diversification you desire. Use
        it to find alternatives to closed funds. Use it to find alternatives to funds that have out-of-reach minimum initial investment requirements.</p>

              Vanguard is famous for its menu of index funds. But not all index funds are good choices. In fact, only a few are worth your investment dollars.

              helps you insure that your portfolio is properly diversified, shows you each fund&rsquo;s top 10 holdings, warns you of the risk of each

              Exchanged Traded Funds, indexing investments that trade like stocks, are hot, which is to say they are wildly popular. Vanguard introduced
                its variant in 2001. ETFs can give you terrific tax advantages, can be much cheaper than even the lowest cost mutual fund, and offer you
                greater flexibility to target a specific sector or geographical region. Vanguard&rsquo;s ETFs are examined under a microscope in this book.
                You&rsquo;ll learn which ones are right for you, which ones to avoid, which ones serve as ideal alternatives to Vanguard&rsquo;s closed
                and high-entry price funds, which ones are safest and which ones carry the most risk. You cannot get this under-the-hood analysis anywhere

                bond fund that&rsquo;s best for 2007, the only annuity fund you should own, the fund that kicks off more income to you than municipal bond
                funds and dividend-based funds. Why live life with less income than Vanguard has to offer you? Your FFSA membership will keep you in the
