must question the long-term impact of technical innovation on the social,
and psychological environment. The automobile is widely to have changed the
of our cities, shifted ownership and retail trade altered sexual customs and
loosened family ties. the Middle East, the rapid spread of radios is
credited with having contributed to resurgence of Arab nationalism. The
birth control the computer, the space effort, well as the and diffusion of
"soft" technologies as systems analysis, have carried significant changes in
their wake. We can no 
afford to let such secondary social cultural effects just "happen." We
attempt to anticipate them in estimating, to the degree their nature,
strength timing. Where these are likely to be seriously damaging, we also be
prepared to block new technology. It is as as that. Technology cannot be
permitted to through the society. It is quite true that can never know all
the effects any action, technological 
otherwise. But it is not true that are helpless. It is, for example,
sometimes to test new technology in limited among limited groups, its
secondary impacts before releasing it diffusion. We could, if we
imaginative, devise living experiments, even volunteer communities, help
guide our technological decisions. Just as may wish to create enclaves the
past where the rate of change artificially slowed, or enclaves the future in
which can pre-sample future environments, we may wish to set aside, even
subsidize, 
high-novelty communities in advanced drugs, power vehicles, cosmetics,
appliances and other innovations experimentally used and investigated. A

The same company will test the product to ascertain it will sell. But, with

to anticipate the effects of various technologies. scientists are rapidly
new tools, from mathematical and simulation to so-called Delphi that permit
us to make more judgments about the consequences our actions. We are
