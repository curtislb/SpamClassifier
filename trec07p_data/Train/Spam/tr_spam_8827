 Bethlehem   Arabic                  house of meat   Standard Hebrew        
         house of bread ,  Bet l     em     Bet l     em   Tiberian Hebrew
 B      l     em      B      l     em   Greek                    is a city in
the Bethlehem Governorate of the West Bank under Palestinian Authority
considered a central hub of Palestinian cultural and tourism industries. It is
inhabited by one of the oldest Christian communities but now has a Muslim
majority, its Christian minority s emigration having accelerated in recent years
due to political and economic factors.

The city has great significance for all Christians as it was the birthplace of
Jesus of Nazareth. The traditional site of Rachel s tomb, which is an important
holy site in Judaism, lies at the city s outskirts. Bethlehem is also home to
one of largest Palestinian Christian communities in the Middle East. It lies
about 10 km  6 mi  south of Jerusalem, standing at an elevation of about 765 m
 2,510 ft  above the sea, thus 30 m  100 ft  higher than Jerusalem. The
Bethlehem agglomeration includes the small towns of Beit Jala and Beit Sahour,
the latter also having Biblical significance.

The Church of the Nativity, built by Constantine the Great in 330, stands in the
centre of Bethlehem over a grotto or cave called the Holy Crypt, which according
to Christian tradition is the place where Jesus was born. This is perhaps the
oldest existing Christian church in the world. Close to it is another grotto,
where Jerome the Latin father spent thirty years of his life in translating the
Scriptures into Latin  see Vulgate .

Bethlehem is home to Bethlehem University, a Roman Catholic institution which
was founded under the direction of the Vatican.

Geography According to the Bethlehem Municipality, the city has a total area of
6.0 km    2.3 m   , all land.  ref Bethlehem Public Relations Department,
January 3, 2007  ref 

General information Population  21,947
 1998 [http   www.pnic.gov.ps english geography Residential_Bethlehem.html]

Topography  32 degrees north of the equator, 2,500 feet  760 m  above sea level

Climate  winter from November to March, coldest in January with high of 13 to
low of 1 degree Celsius  summer from June to September, warmest in August with
high of 27 to low of 17 degrees Celsius.

History Biblical The city, located in the  hill country  of Judah, was
originally called Ephrath  Gen. 35 16, 19  48 7  Ruth 4 11 . It was also called
Beth lehem Ephratah  Micah 5 2 , Beth lehem judah  1 Sam. 17 12 , and  the city
of David   Luke 2 4 . It is first noticed in Scripture as the place where Rachel
died and was buried  by the wayside,  directly to the north of the city  Gen.
48 7 . Rachel s tomb is located at the roadside near Bethlehem. The valley to
the east was the scene of the story of Ruth the Moabitess. There are the fields
in which she gleaned, and the path by which she and Naomi returned to the town.
     City of David  Bethlehem is the birth place of David, the second king of
Israel, and it is also the place where he was anointed as king by Samuel  1 Sam.
16 4 13   and it was from the well of Bethlehem that three of his heroes brought
water for him at the risk of their lives when he was in the cave of Adullam  2
Sam. 23 13 17 .

 Jesus  birthplace  Since it was distinguished above every other city as the birth 
place of  Him whose goings forth have been of old   Micah 5 2 , it was here that
the birth of Christ was expected. Accordingly, the gospels  Luke 2 4 and Matthew
2 1  report that Jesus, whom they proclaim as the Messiah, was born in
Bethlehem, although he grew up in Nazareth. Matthew reports that Herod had  all
the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two
years old and under  killed when Jesus was born  Matt. 2 16, 18  Jer. 31 15 .
Jesus  family escaped this fate for him, by fleeing to Egypt and then returning
after Herod had died, shortly thereafter.

Roman and Byzantine periods

The city was wrecked during Bar Kokhba s revolt  132 135  and the Romans set up
a shrine to Adonis on the site of the Nativity. Only in 326 was the first
Christian church constructed, when Helena, the mother of the first Christian
emperor, Constantine, visited Bethlehem.

During the Samaritan revolt of 529, Bethlehem was sacked and its walls and the
Church of the Nativity destroyed, but they were soon rebuilt on the orders of
the Emperor Justinian I. In 614, the Persians invaded Palestine and captured
Bethlehem. A story recounted in later sources holds that they refrained from
destroying the Church of the Nativity on seeing the magi depicted in Persian
clothing in one of the mosaics.
