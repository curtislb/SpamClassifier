In J. R. R. Tolkien s legendarium,  Arda  is the name given to the Earth in a
period of fictional prehistory, wherein the places mentioned in [[The Lord of
the Rings]] and related material once existed. It included several seas and
oceans, and the continents of Middle earth, the Dark Lands, and Aman, as well as
the island of N  menor and other lands, left largely unnamed by Tolkien.

Overview

Arda was part of E  , the universe of all which exists. Arda was created,
together with the rest of E  , through the Music of the Ainur for the Children
of Il  vatar  that is, Elves and Men .

Because the Sun, Moon, stars, and other objects orbited the planet in the
cosmology of Middle earth they were considered part of Arda, leading to Arda
sometimes being called the  Solar System  of Middle earth. The term for the
Earth itself, excluding these celestial bodies, was  Ambar  or  Imbar .

Originally the Earth  Arda  was flat, the continents were surrounded by a mighty
ocean  or perhaps by space , Ekkaia or Vaiya, the Encircling Sea, and separated
by Belegaer, called the Great Sea and the Sundering Seas. In the First Age, the
area in the northwest of Middle earth was occupied by the country of Beleriand,
but this was destroyed during the War of Wrath.

There was also a separate continent south and east of Middle earth called the
Dark Land. Another separate continent to the east of Middle earth was the
relatively small Land of the Sun, so called because when the world was flat the
Gates of the Sun were near there, and it would be scorched.

Information regarding both was vague. To the south were the Hither Lands
including Harad, though  Harad  means  South  and while properly used for the
region immediately south of Gondor and Mordor was often loosely used to refer to
every land to the south. There were many stretches of sun scorched desert in
Near Harad, but there was supposedly a jungle beyond it which few had ever
ventured to, from which the great Oliphaunts were found. Men of Far Harad are
also described as being black skinned. The vast lands East were collectively
referred to as Rh  n, though this may have only referred to those immediately
east of the Sea of Rh  n and River Running. The Easterlings, like the Haradrim,
were a diverse collection of many races. There was even less knowledge of the
extreme eastern end of Middle earth, where the land was supposed to stop at
another sea. It is known that in ancient times the great chain of the Red
Mountains ran north to south near here, and was roughly analogous to the Blue
Mountains of the west  the world was once symmetrical at the dawn of time . The
race of Elves first originated near here, though their original home of
Cuivi  nen no longer existed by the Third Age. It is not known if the Red
Mountains survived into the Third Age, either intact or in some reduced form
 like the Blue Mountains . It is said that the Blue Wizards went far into the
east of Rh  n and beyond to stir up rebellions against Sauron in the lands he
held sway over, though the tales of these struggles never reached the west in
detail. It is also said that the Blue Wizards may have failed in their mission 
this is interpreted several ways, either that like Saruman they set themselves
up as lords of men, or that like Radagast they started to care more for the
local people they were charged with protecting than Middle earth as a whole and
