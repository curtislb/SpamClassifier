I was thinking about our conversation last night and I got 
to tell ya, the chicks really love me now. Those pills Im taking 
are incredible. I measured myself last night and I gained 
another inch this week alone.

I know I couldn't remember the site last night when we were
out but here it is. http://dahts.com  I ordered the the 6 Bottle 
supply and they gave me an extra 4 bottles at no cost. I tell ya 
man these do work. Give me a call on the weekend and we'll go 
to the bar.

See ya
