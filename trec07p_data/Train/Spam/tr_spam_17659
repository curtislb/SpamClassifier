 Liberty  is generally considered a concept of political philosophy and
identifies the condition in which an individual has the ability to act according
to his or her own will.

Political philosophies rooted in individualism and socialism often conceive of
liberty differently  individualist and liberal conceptions of liberty relate to
the freedom of the individual from outside compulsion  a socialist perspective,
on the other hand, regards liberty as the equal distribution of power, arguing
that liberty without equality amounts to the domination of the most powerful.

John Stuart Mill, in his work, [[On Liberty]], was the first to recognize the
difference between liberty as the freedom to act and liberty as the absence of
coercion. In his book, [[Two Concepts of Liberty]], Isaiah Berlin formally
framed the differences between these two perspectives as the distinction between
two opposite concepts of liberty  positive liberty and negative liberty. The
latter designates a negative condition in which an individual is protected from
tyranny and the arbitrary exercise of authority, while the former implies the
right to exercise civil rights, such as standing for office.

Alexis de Tocqueville, in his work, [[Democracy in America]], was the first to
coin the terms [[soft tyranny]] and [[mutual liberty]]. ref Alexis de
Tocqueville, Democracy in America,  New York  Bantam Books, 2000 , 9 15.  ref 
Likewise, John Stuart Mill offered insight into the notions of soft tyranny and
mutual liberty with his [[harm principle]]. ref John Stuart Mill, On Liberty and
Utilitarianism,  New York  Bantam Books, 1993 , 12 16.  ref  Overall, it is
important to understand these concepts when discussing liberty since they all
represent little pieces of the greater puzzle known as freedom. In a
philosophical sense, morality must supersede tyranny in any legitimate form of
government. Otherwise, people are left with a societal system rooted in
backwardness, disorder, and regression.

Positive liberty


 Positive liberty  is an idea that was first expressed and analyzed as a
separate conception of liberty by Jean Jacques Rousseau but most notably
described by Isaiah Berlin. It refers to the opportunity and ability to act and
fulfill one s own potential, as opposed to [[negative liberty]], which refers to
freedom from coercion.

Positive liberty is often described as freedom to achieve certain ends, while
negative liberty is described as from external coercion. The idea of positive
liberty is often emphasized by those on the left wing of the political spectrum,
whereas negative liberty is most important for those who lean towards
libertarianism. However, not all on either the left or right would accept the
positive negative liberty distinction as genuine or significant.

Among the right wing, some conservatives also embrace some forms of positive
liberty. For example, Puritans such as Cotton Mather often referred to liberty
in their writings, but focused on the liberty from sin  e.g. sexual urges  even
at the expense of liberty from the government. Many anarchists, and others
considered to be on the left wing, see the two concepts of positive and negative
liberty as interdependent and  thus  inseparable.

While he described the concept of positive liberty, Isaiah Berlin was deeply
suspicious of it. He argued that the pursuit of positive liberty could lead to a
situation where the state forced upon people a certain way of life, because the
state judged that it was the most rational course of action, and therefore, was
what a person should desire, whether or not people actually did desire it.

Defenders of  positive liberty  say that there is no need for it to have such
totalitarian undertones, and that there is a great difference between a
government providing positive liberty to its citizens and a government presuming
to make their decisions for them. For example, they argue that any democratic
government upholding positive liberty would not suffer from the problems Berlin
described, because such a government would not be in a position to ignore the
wishes of people or societies. Also, many on the left see positive liberty as
guaranteeing equal rights to certain things like education and employment, and
an important defense against discrimination  mdash  here, positive liberty could
be the governmental demand that  for example  the sex of an applicant be ignored
when a firm hires a new employee.

Negative liberty


The philosophical concept of  negative liberty  refers to an individual s
liberty from being subjected to the authority of others. In this negative sense,
one is considered free to the extent to which no person interferes with his or
her activity. According to Thomas Hobbes, for example,  a free man is he that...
is not hindered to do what he hath the will to do. 

The distinction between negative liberty and positive liberty was drawn by
Isaiah Berlin in his lecture entitled  Two Concepts of Liberty.  According to
Berlin, this distinction is deeply embedded in the political tradition  the
notion of negative liberty being associated most strongly with the classical
British political philosophers  e.g. Locke, Hobbes and Smith  and positive
liberty with continental European thinkers such as Hegel, Rousseau, Herder, and
Marx.

The concept of negative liberty has several noteworthy aspects. First, negative
