<FONT face=3DArial size=3D2>Hello dear friend!
My name is Yuliya. I am 26 years old. I'm from Russia, city
Yoshkar-Ola.
I live together with my mum and I work as adviser on sale home
appliances.
I have many various hobbies: sport, a photo, drawing. I dream to have
strong and happy family.
It's my purpose in life. I want to be happy and to do happy my family.
=Recently I thought that I have it already. However.......
I wish to tell you history which have pushed me write to you.
6-7 months ago I have got acquainted with man from your country. His
name is Donovan.
Our meeting was at a seminar in city St. Peterburg. It was the working
=meeting. Between us began the novel.
It was so fast and I thought that it's my man. Through 3 days he has
left home.<br>
We have understood that letters can not replace our meeting face to
face again.<br>
Donovan has told that I should arrive to him!!! I was very glad during
=that moment.
I wrote the application for reception visa. I waited reception of visa
=approximately half of year.
All this time Donovan called and wrote to me letters. All things was
very good.
I have received the invitation from the ambassador for reception visa.
=My director has given me holiday from work and I have gone to Moscow to=

receive visa.
I said this news to Donovan, but he told that he does not want our
meeting.
He played with me. He has told me that he has wife with 3!!!!!!
children and now he don't want our meeting.
I have been broken...
I could not think that it was game with my feelings..... I did not
think that people are so severe.......
Now I am in Moscow and waiting for reception visa.
I don't want that all was gone for nothing and will be glad if my visa
=will be useful to our meeting.
I could arrive already in 4-5 days, but I have problem.
I don't know any man who would like my arrival.
I hope that it will not sound silly if I will ask you about our meeting=

and good time together.
I don't know your ideas about my letter, but it would be fine if we
could meet and have some weeks or months together.
I want to use my visa for trip to your country and search man with
which I would like to have happy and strong family.
I was never married and have no any children. I'm woman which ready to
=creation family with good man.
I don't know about you anything, but I want it very much.
It would be fine if we could meet, to do friendship or more than simply=

friendship.
I will be happy if you also have a free time and we could meet soon.
I don't know about your plans at present time, but I sincerely hope
that we can have meeting with you in the near future.
You can write all that you want. Ask any questions which interest you.
=I hope that you understand my English :) I began to study English
approximately 1,5 year ago.
Write to me back and I will tell more about myself and send my photos.
= <br><br>
