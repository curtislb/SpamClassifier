 Northumberland  is a county in the North East of England. The non metropolitan
county of Northumberland borders Cumbria to the west, County Durham to the south
and Tyne and Wear to the south east, as well as having a border with the
Scottish Borders council area to the north, and nearly eighty miles of North Sea
coastline. Since 1974 the county council has been located in Morpeth, situated
in the east of the county at   however, both Morpeth and Alnwick claim the title
county town.

As the kingdom of Northumbria under King Edwin, the region s historical
boundaries stretched from the Humber in the south to the Forth in the north. The
historic boundaries of the county cover a different area, including Newcastle upon 
Tyne, the traditional county town, as well as Tynemouth and other settlements in
North Tyneside, areas administered by Tyne and Wear since 1974 under the Local
Government Act 1972. The historic boundaries of the county are sometimes taken
to exclude Islandshire, Bedlingtonshire and Norhamshire  collectively North
Durham , exclaves of County Durham which were incorporated into Northumberland
in 1844.

Being on the border of Scotland and England, Northumberland has been the site of
many battles. The county is noted for its undeveloped landscape of high
moorland, a favourite with landscape painters, and now largely protected as a
National Park.

Northumberland s county flower is the Bloody Cranesbill  Geranium sanguineum 
and her affiliated Royal Navy ship is her namesake, HMS   Northumberland  .

History


Once part of the Roman Empire and the scene of many wars between England and
Scotland, Northumberland has a long and complicated history. Hence there are
many castles in Northumberland, including among the better known those at
Bamburgh, Dunstanburgh, Warkworth and Alnwick.

The region of present day Northumberland once formed the core of the Anglian
kingdom of Northumbria. Northumberland is called the  cradle of Christianity  in
England, because it was on Lindisfarne, a tidal island north of Bamburgh, also
called Holy Island, that Christianity flourished when monks from Iona were sent
to convert the English. Lindisfarne was the home of the Lindisfarne Gospels and
Saint Cuthbert, who is buried at Durham Cathedral.

Bamburgh is the historic capit</STYLE>
