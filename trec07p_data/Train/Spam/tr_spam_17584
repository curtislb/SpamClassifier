 or King Salmon is the largest salmon in North America and can grow to
 1.5 nbsp m  58 inches  in length and to 57 nbsp kg  125 pounds  in weight. This
 specimen shows the jaws drawn into a curved  kype , a secondary sex
 characteristic typical of many male salmon around spawning time.]]

 Salmon  is the common name for several species of fish of the family
Salmonidae. Several other fish in the family are called trout. Salmon live in
both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, as well as the Great Lakes and other land
locked lakes.

Typically, salmon are anadromous  they are born in fresh water, migrate to the
ocean, then return to fresh water to reproduce. Folklore has it that the fish
return to the exact spot where they were born to spawn, and modern research
shows that usually at least 90  of the fish that spawn in a particular stream
were born there. In Alaska, the crossing over to other streams allows salmon to
populate new streams, such as those that emerge as a glacier retreats. The
precise method salmon use to navigate has not been entirely established, though
their keen sense of smell is certainly involved. In all species of Pacific
salmon, the mature individuals die within a few days or weeks of spawning, a
trait known as semelparity. However, even in those species of salmon that may
survive to spawn more than once  iteroparity , post spawning mortality is quite
high  perhaps as high as 40 to 50 .  Those species average about two or,
perhaps, three spawning events per individual.

Salmon has long been at the heart of the culture and livelihood of coastal
dwellers. Most peoples of the Northern Pacific shore had a ceremony to honor the
first return of the year. For many centuries, people caught salmon as they swam
upriver to spawn. A famous spearfishing site on the Columbia River at Celilo
Falls was inundated after great dams were built on the river. The Ainu, of
northern Japan, taught dogs how to catch salmon as they returned to their
breeding grounds en masse. Now, salmon are caught in bays and near shore. Drift
net fisheries have been banned on the high seas except off Northumberland on the
east coast of England.

Salmon population levels are of concern in the Atlantic and in some parts of the
Pacific but in northern British Columbia and Alaska stocks are still abundant.
The Skeena River alone has millions of wild salmon returning which support
commercial fisheries, aboriginal food fisheries, sports fisheries and the area s
diverse wildlife on the coast and around communities hundreds of miles inland in
the watershed. The Columbia River salmon population is now less than 3  of what
it was when Lewis and Clark arrived at the river. ref   ref 

Both Atlantic and Pacific Salmon are important to recreational fishing around
the world.

In the southern hemisphere, there is the Australian salmon, which is a salt
water species not related in any way to the salmonidae. It is found along the
southern coastline of Australia and Tasmania. Commonly caught there with large
beach nets, its use as a commercial fish has been declining over the last 20
years.

Life History of Salmon , in the lower right the blood vessels surround the yolk
and in the upper left the black eyes are visible, even the little lens]]
spinning around the yolk and little oildrops, also the gut, the spine, the main
caudal blood vessel, the bladder and the arcs of the gills]] In order to lay her
roe, the female salmon uses her tail fin to excavate a shallow depression,
called a redd. The redd may sometimes contain 5,000 eggs covering 30 square
feet. ref   ref  The eggs usually range from orange to red in color. One or more
males will approach the female in her redd, depositing his sperm, or milt, over
the roe. ref name   USFWS    ref  The female then covers the eggs by disturbing
the gravel at the upstream edge of the depression before moving on to make
another redd. The female will make as many as 7 redds before her supply of eggs
is exhausted. The salmon then die within a few days of spawning. ref
name  USFWS    

The eggs will hatch into alevin or sac fry. The fry quickly develop into parr
with camouflaging vertical stripes. The parr stay for one to three years in
their natal stream before becoming smolts which are distinguished by their
bright silvery colour with scales that are easily rubbed off. It is estimated
that only 10  of all salmon eggs survive long enough to reach this
stage. ref   ref  The smolt body chemistry changes, allowing them to live in
salt water. Smolts spend a portion of their out migration time in brackish
water, where their body chemistry becomes accustomed to osmoregulation in the
ocean.

The salmon spend one to five years  depending on the species  in the open ocean
where they will become sexually mature. The adult salmon returns primarily to
its natal stream to spawn. When fish return for the first time they are called
whitling in the UK and grilse or peel in Ireland. Prior to spawning, depending
on the species, the salmon undergoes changes. They may grow a hump, develop
canine teeth, develop a kype  a pronounced curvature of the jaws in male
salmon . All will change from the silvery blue of a fresh run fish from the sea
to a darker color. Condition tends to deteriorate the longer the fish remain in
freshwater, and they then deteriorate further after they spawn becoming known as
kelts. Salmon can make amazing journeys, sometimes moving hundreds of miles
upstream against strong currents and rapids to reproduce. Chinook and sockeye
salmon from central Idaho, for example, travel over 900 miles and climb nearly
7000 feet from the Pacific ocean as they return to spawn.

The age of a salmon can be deduced from the growth rings on its scales, examined
under the microscope. Each year, the fish experiences a period of rapid growth,
often in summer, and one of slower growth, normally in winter. This results in
rings  annuli  analogous to the growth rings visible in a tree trunk. Freshwater
growth shows as densely crowded rings, sea growth as widely spaced rings 
spawning is marked by significant erosion as body mass is converted into eggs
and milt.
