Founded in 1786,  Knoxville  is the third largest city in the state of Tennessee
behind Memphis and Nashville and is the county seat location of Knox County,
Tennessee, United States. It is the principal city of and is included in the
 Knoxville, Tennessee Metropolitan Statistical Area  which is included in the
 Knoxville Sevierville La Follette Combined Statistical Area . As of the 2005
census estimates, Knoxville had a total population of 180,130, with a metro
population of 655,400.

Of Tennessee s four major cities, Knoxville is the second oldest. Nashville is
older, being founded in 1779. Knoxville also was the state s first capital when
Tennessee was admitted into the Union in 1796, in which capacity it served until
1819, when the capital was moved to Murfreesboro. The city was named in honor of
the first Secretary of War, Henry Knox.

One of Knoxville s nicknames is The Marble City. In the early 20th century, a
number of quarries were active in the city, supplying Tennessee pink marble
 actually Ordovician limestone of the Holston Formation  to much of the country.
Notable buildings such as the National Gallery in Washington are constructed of
Knoxville marble. The National Gallery s fountains were turned by Candoro Marble
Company, which once ran the largest marble lathes in the United States.

Knoxville was once also known as the Underwear Capital of the World. In the
1930s, no fewer than 20 textile and clothing mills operated in Knoxville, and
the industry was the city s largest employer. Most of the mills were located in
the historic Old City. In the 1950s, the mills began to close, causing an
overall population loss of 10  by 1960.

Knoxville is also the home of the University of Tennessee s primary campus
 UTK . The university s sports teams, called the  Volunteers  or  Vols,  are
extremely popular in the surrounding area. In recognition of this popularity,
the telephone area code for Knox County and eight adjacent counties is 865
 VOL . Knoxville is also the home of the Women s Basketball Hall of Fame, almost
entirely thanks to the popularity of Pat Summitt and the University of Tennessee
women s basketball team.

As of 2006, the current mayor is Bill Haslam, who defeated Madeline Rogero in
2003. The previous mayor of sixteen years, Victor Ashe, was named United States
Ambassador to Poland in June 2004. Ashe was term limited and could not serve
another term.

History The first humans to live in what is now Knoxville were of the Woodland
tribe, a group of hunters and trappers driven south from the Great Lakes region
by climatic changes, probably about 1000 B.C. Their culture eventually gave way
to that of the more sophisticated mound builders, whose influence was felt
throughout most of the South. The Shawnee and Creek briefly occupied small areas
in the state, but little archaeological evidence has been found. By the 18th
century, the only native peoples living permanently around what would later be
Knoxville were the Cherokee. The Cherokee people called this area Shacomage, or
 Place of Blue Smoke. 

Early contacts between the European settlers and the Cherokee were fairly
cordial, which encouraged colonial expansion into the land west of the Great
Smoky Mountains. White s Fort was settled in 1786 by James White, a militia
officer during the American Revolutionary War. When William Blount, the
territorial governor of the Southwest Territory, moved the territorial capital
to White s Fort in 1791, he renamed it Knoxville in honor of Henry Knox, the
American Revolutionary War general and Washington s Secretary of War.

One of William Blount s first tasks was to meet with the Cherokee and establish
territorial boundaries  this he accomplished almost immediately in the Treaty of
Holston, and he believed that he had  purchased  much of what is now East
Tennessee when it was signed in 1791. However, the terms of the treaty came
under dispute, culminating in several large Cherokee attacks on Knoxville  200
Cherokee lead by John Watts marched on Knoxville in 1792, and a second group of
Cherokee attacked Covet s Station in 1793. Both attacks were repelled by
Knoxville settlers. Knoxville settlers attacked the Cherokee several times as
well  when the government invited the Cherokee s chief Hanging Maw for
negotiations in 1793, Knoxville settlers attacked the Cherokee against orders,
killing the chief s wife. Peace was renegotiated in 1794  ref De Bow s Review.
October, 1859. Vol. XXVII, O.S. Enlarged Series. Vol. II, No. 4, N.S. Pages 407 
419, [http   www.knoxcotn.org history debow.html]  ref .

Despite these tensions, the Treaty of Holston opened the area to even more
settlers  Knoxville served as the territorial capital until 1796, when a
constitutional convention was held in Knoxville to establish Tennessee as a
state. When Tennessee entered the United States in 1796, Knoxville was the first
capital of the state until 1815, when the capital was moved to Murfreesboro. On
May 28, 1830, President Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act, requiring all
Native Americans to leave their homes and move west of the Mississippi River.
Many Cherokees refused to go, and filed a lawsuit against the government to stop
this from taking place. However, many of the remaining Cherokee left the
Knoxville area at this time in the Trail of Tears.
