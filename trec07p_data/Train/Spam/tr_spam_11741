 Chess  is a recreational and competitive game for two players. Sometimes called
 Western Chess  or  International Chess  to distinguish it from its predecessors
and other chess variants, the current form of the game emerged in Southern
Europe in the second half of the 15th century after evolving from similar, much
older games of Indian origin.

Today, chess is one of the world s most popular games, played by an estimated
605 million people worldwide in clubs, online, by correspondence  mail and e 
mail , in tournaments  amateur and professional  and informally. Aspects of art
and science are found in chess composition and theory. Chess is also advocated
as a way of enhancing mental prowess.

The game is played on a square chequered chessboard. At the start, each player
  white  and  black   controls sixteen pieces  one king, one queen, two rooks,
two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The object of the game is to
checkmate the opponent s king, whereby the king is under immediate attack  in
 check   and there is no way to remove it from attack on the next move.
Theoreticians have developed extensive chess strategies and tactics since the
game s inception.

The tradition of organized competitive chess started in the 16th century. The
first official World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in
1886  Vladimir Kramnik, today, is the 14th Champion in this lineage. There are
also biennial world team events called Chess Olympiads. Since the 20th century,
two international organizations, the World Chess Federation and the
International Correspondence Chess Federation have organized and overseen the
top chess competitions and international titles.

One of the goals of early computer scientists was to create a chess playing
machine, and today s chess is deeply influenced by the abilities of current
chess programs. In 1997, a match between Garry Kasparov, then World Champion,
and IBM s Deep Blue chess program proved for the first time that computers are
able to beat even the strongest human players. The popularity of online chess
coincided with the growth of the Internet, which started in the mid 1990s.

Rules

 For a simple demonstration of the gameplay, see
 [http   en.wikibooks.org wiki Transwiki Sample_chess_game sample chess game].

Chess is played on a square board of eight rows  called   ranks   and numbered 1
to 8  and eight columns  called   files   and labeled a to h  of squares. The
colors of the sixty four squares alternate and are referred to as  light
squares  and  dark squares . The pieces are divided into two matching sets, by
convention called White and Black. Each player, referred to by the color of his
pieces, begins the game with sixteen pieces  these comprise one king, one queen,
two rooks, two bishops, two knights and eight pawns.

The colors are chosen either by a friendly agreement, by a game of chance or by
a tournament director. The chessboard is placed with a light square at each
player s right on the nearest rank, and the pieces are set out on the first and
last two ranks as shown in the diagram. Each queen stands on a square of its own
color.

White makes the first move. The players then alternate moving one piece of their
own at a time  with the exception of castling, when a rook and the king are
moved simultaneously . Pieces are moved to either an unoccupied square, or one
occupied by an opponent s piece, capturing it and removing it from play. With
one exception  en passant , all pieces capture opponent s pieces by moving to
the square that the opponent s piece occupies. When a piece can be captured on
the opposing player s next move, it is said to be  threatened  or  under
attack .

When a player s king is under direct attack, it is said to be in   check  . A
player is not permitted to make any move that would place his king in check, and
if his king is put in check he is then required to immediately make a move that
takes the king out of check. If no such move is available, the player is
checkmated. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent.  /
