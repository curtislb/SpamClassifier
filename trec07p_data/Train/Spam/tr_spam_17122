Dear Sir,

I am representing the interest of an investor seeking for your cooperation in building a Tourist Hotel or Real Estate projects in your country. I am sorry if this is not in line with your business. However I need an experienced person like you to assist me to set up and develop the project. On the resumption of the project, you will be made a Partner/Director for the role and the assistance you rendered. You will also
be entitled to a percentage agreed upon between me (as the representative of the Investor) and you before the commencement of the project.
Your immediate reply will be highly appreciated and I shall give you more information on this project. Please contact me at my private e-mail address:ryanlareen@myway.com
Thanks and God bless.

Yours faithfully,

Ryan Lareen Ph.D
Principal Partner
