 performing Yogic meditation]]  Yoga   Devanagari             is one of the six
 schools of Hindu philosophy, focusing on meditation as a path to self knowledge
 and liberation. Hindu texts establishing the basis for yoga include the
 Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, the Hatha Yoga
 Pradipika and many others. ref name Knitter Zen Buddhism  A History  India and

 Garripoli  ref  In India, Yoga is seen as a means to both physiological and
 spiritual mastery. Outside India, Yoga has become primarily associated with the
 practice of asanas  postures  of Hatha Yoga  see Yoga as exercise , although it
 has influenced the entire dharmic religions family and other spiritual
 practices throughout the world. ref name Knitter   A committed practitioner of
 yoga is referred to as a yogi, yogin  masculine , or yogini  feminine .

The main branches of Yoga specificed in the Hindu texts, and generally accepted
by both modern scholars and practitioners alike, include  Hatha Yoga, Karma
Yoga, Jnana Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, Tantra Yoga, and Raja Yoga.  ref

History of Yoga

5,000 year old carvings from the Indus Valley Civilization depict a figure that
archaeologists believe represents a yogi sitting in meditation
posture. ref Singh, S.P., Rgvedic Base of the Pasupati Seal of Mohenjo Daro,
Puratattva 19  19 26. 1989  ref  ref Kenoyer, Jonathan Mark. Ancient Cities of
the Indus Valley Civilization. Karachi  Oxford University Press,
1998.  ref  ref [http   www.harappa.com indus 33.html Archaeologist Jonathan
Mark Kenoyer   s description of the yogi seal] from his online slide show and
narrative  ref  The figure is shown sitting in a traditional cross legged yoga
pose with its hands resting on its knees. The discoverer of the seal,
archaeologist Sir John Marshall, named the figure Shiva
[[Pashupati]]. ref Marshall, Sir John, Mohenjo Daro and the Indus Civilization,
London 1931  ref 

, showing a figure in meditation posture.]]

The first known written reference to yoga is in the Rig Veda, estimated by the
western scholars to be at least 3,500 years old. ref Frawley, David, Yoga and
Buddhism. Hinduism Today, February, 1998.  ref  The Upanishads,  800 100 BCE ,
Bhagavad Gita  400 100 BCE , and the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali  200 BCE 300 CE 
also discuss the concepts and teachings of yoga.

Etymology Sanskrit   IAST/[[ wikt yoga/yoga]]   is a derivation of Proto Indo 
European yugam, from a root yeug   Sanskrit yuj   meaning  to join  or  unite  
cognate to Latin iugum and modern English yoke.

The term is attested since the Rigveda in the sense of  act of yoking, joining,
attaching, harnessing  but also  undertaking, business, performance . A mental
sense of  exertion, zeal, diligence  is attested since the Mahabharata, and the
spiritual or mystical sense of  abstract contemplation, meditation  likewise
appears in the Mahabharata as well as in the Upanishads.

Bhagavad Gita

The Bhagavad Gita   Song of the Lord  , thought to have been written some time
between 400 and 100 BCE, uses the term yoga extensively in a variety of senses.
Of many possible meanings given to the term in the Gita, most emphasis is given
to these three  ref Flood, p. 96.  ref 

 Karma yoga  The yoga of action  Jnana yoga  The yoga of knowledge  Bhakti yoga 
The yoga of devotion

The influential commentator Madhusudana Sarasvati  b. circa 1490  divided the
Gita s eighteen chapters into three sections, each of six chapters. According to
his method of division the first six chapters deal with Karma Yoga, which is the
means to the final goal, and the last six deal with the goal itself, which he
says is Knowledge  Jnana . The middle six deal with bhakti. ref Gambhirananda,
p. 16.  ref  This system has been adopted by some later commentators and
rejected by others.

Yoga Sutras of Patanjali

 yogi in the Birla Mandir, Delhi]] The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali are a book of
 196 aphorisms compiled by the sage Patanjali at some time between 200 BCE and
 300 CE.

Patanjali s yoga is a form of Raja yoga, as it seeks meditation as the path
towards the ultimate goal. Patanjali himself referred to it as  Ashtanga Yoga 
  Eight Limbed Yoga  , from the eight steps he set out as the practical path
towards attainment of enlightenment. This eight limbed concept became an
authoritative feature of Raja yoga from that point forward, and is a core
characteristic of practically every Raja yoga variation taught today.
Patanjali s Eight Limbs of yoga practice are
