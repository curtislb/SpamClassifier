 The Graduate  is a 1967 film directed by Mike Nichols based on the novel of the
same name by Charles Webb. The screenplay is by Calder Willingham and Buck
Henry. The film tells the story of Benjamin Braddock  played by Dustin Hoffman ,
a recent college graduate with no well defined aim in life, who is seduced by
Mrs. Robinson  Anne Bancroft  and then falls in love with her daughter Elaine
 Katharine Ross .

Synopsis


The film explores the life of 21 year old Benjamin Braddock shortly after
earning his bachelor s degree from an unnamed university in the Northeast. The
movie begins at a party celebrating his graduation at his parents  house in
suburban Los Angeles. Benjamin is visibly uncomfortable at the party attended by
mostly his parents  friends. He remains aloof while his parents deliver
accolades and neighborhood friends ask him about his future plans. Benjamin
escapes from each person who comes to congratulate him, exposing his seeming
embarrassment at all the honors he had won at college. His father s business
partner s wife, Mrs. Robinson, asks Benjamin to drive her home, which he
reluctantly does. We never learn Mrs. Robinson s first name  or, indeed, the
first names of any of Benjamin s and Elaine s parents  during the course of the
film  in the novel, we are told that the initial of Mrs Robinson s first name is
G .

Arriving at her home, she pleads for him to come inside, saying that she doesn t
like to enter a dark house. Once inside, she forces a drink on him, and later
exposes herself to him offering to have an affair with him. This scene, known as
the  Mrs. Robinson, you are trying to seduce me  scene, as said by Benjamin, is
said to be one of the most iconic scenes in the film. Initially flustered, he is
immediately shocked by her advances and flees. A few days later he calls her and
their affair begins.

Benjamin is clearly uncomfortable with sexuality, but he is drawn into the
affair with the older, but still attractive, Mrs. Robinson. Their affair appears
to last most of the summer. All of their scenes pass in a musically backed
montage, showing the endless pass of time. One scene is edited so that it
appears Benjamin is walking directly from his parent s dining room into the
hotel room he shares with Mrs. Robinson. This seems to accent the separation of
him and his parents, though they still live under the same roof.

Meanwhile Benjamin is hounded by his father to select a graduate school to
attend. Benjamin, clearly not interested in pursuing his studies, shrugs off his
father s wishes and spends his time lounging and sleeping with Mrs. Robinson.
His affair may serve as an escape from his lack of direction or ambition, and
his fear and anxiety of his impending future.      Unsourced image removed     
Mr. Robinson, unaware of his wife s budding affair, encourages Benjamin to call
his daughter, Elaine. Benjamin s parents also repeatedly encourage him to date
her. During one liaison, Mrs. Robinson violently forces a promise from Ben to
never date Elaine. Whether out of fear of Mrs. Robinson, or sensing that getting
involved with the daughter of his lover could be disastrous, he tries to avoid
it. However, because of the three parents  persistent intervention, he is
essentially forced to date her. Therefore, he tries to ensure his date with her
will be a disaster so she would not want to pursue a relationship with him. He
drives recklessly, practically ignoring Elaine, and then takes her to a strip
club where she is openly offended and silently begins to cry.

After she storms out of the establishment, he is overcome with guilt and pursues
her, apologizes, and then kisses her. What follows is a relationship with the
young Robinson, exactly what Benjamin and Mrs. Robinson were trying to avoid.

>From here, Benjamin s life falls apart. His affair is discovered and, although
he follows Elaine to the University of California, Berkeley, where she is a
student, he is barred from seeing Elaine any further. She proceeds to become
engaged to another man mdash one her parents find acceptable. However, Benjamin,
believing  with some justification  that she loves him, refuses to give up hope,
despite warnings from Mr. Robinson and threats of arrest from Mrs. Robinson.

In the famous conclusion of the film, Benjamin undertakes a desperate drive
across a distance of many miles to somehow head off Elaine s wedding. He is
forced to stop for directions, his car runs out of gas, and he is ultimately
forced to run the final few blocks. He arrives just as the bride and groom are
exchanging vows, and stands looking down at the couple from an upper window. He
begins rapping on the glass and screams  Elaine  Elaine  , but they do not
garner much response at first, but when Elaine gives the return cry  Ben  
mayhem ensues.

After a violent struggle with Elaine s parents and wedding guests  Ben armed
only with a large cross , Ben and Elaine escape on a public bus. The escaping
couple sits smiling at the back of the bus, the other passengers stare at them
in mute disbelief, and the movie closes with a shot through the back window of
Ben and Elaine s smiles fading to an enigmatic neutral expression, and Simon and
Garfunkel s soundtrack.
