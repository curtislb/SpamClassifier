     Start of article      Sheffield  is a city and metropolitan borough in
South Yorkshire, England. It is so named because of its origins in a field on
the River Sheaf that runs through the city. The city has grown from its largely
industrial roots to encompass a wide economic base. The population of the City
of Sheffield is estimated at 520,700 people  2005 , ref The mid 2005 population
estimate for the City of Sheffield was 520,700 according to the
[http   www.statistics.gov.uk statbase ssdataset.asp?vlnk 9394 More Y Office for
National Statistics]. It should be noted that this figure includes the whole
area included in the city. Some population figures, for example those given at
List of English cities by population use just the urban core of the city and
therefore are lower. The [http   www.sheffield.nhs.uk healthdata 4 1.php
Neighbourhood profiles] given by the Sheffield Health Authority estimates the
figure at 542,716.  ref  and it is one of the eight largest English cities
outside London, which form the English Core Cities Group.

The city became world famous in the 19th century for its production of steel.
Many innovations in the industry were developed locally, including crucible and
stainless steel. This fuelled an almost tenfold increase in the population
during the Industrial Revolution. It gained its city charter in 1893 and became
officially titled the City of Sheffield. International competition caused a
decline in local industry during the 1970s and 1980s, and at the same time the
national coal industry collapsed, affecting Sheffield s population. In recent
years the city has reinvented itself as a sporting and technology city.

Geography

Sheffield is located at . It lies directly beside Rotherham, from which it is
separated by the M1 motorway. Although Barnsley Metropolitan Borough also
borders Sheffield to the north, the town itself is a few miles further. The
southern and western borders of the city are shared with Derbyshire  in the
first half of the 20th century Sheffield extended its borders south into
Derbyshire, annexing a number of villages. ref
name  derbyshire_expansion    ref  Directly to the west of the city is the Peak
District National Park and the Pennine hill range.

Sheffield is a geographically diverse city. ref name  GEO_diverse    ref  The
city nestles in a natural amphitheatre created by several hills ref name  number
of hills  It is often stated that Sheffield is built on seven hills  for an
example see Sheffield Hallam University s [http   www.shu.ac.uk sheffield  guide
to the city for new students] . However,
[http   www.mdfs.net Docs Sheffield Hills  a study by J.G.Harston] found there
to be eight.  ref  and the confluence of five rivers  Don, Sheaf, Rivelin,
Loxley and Porter. As such, much of the city is built on hillsides with views
into the city centre or out to the countryside. The city s lowest point is just
10 nbsp m above sea level, while some parts of the city are at over
500 nbsp metres  1,640 nbsp ft . However, 89  of the housing in the city is
between 100 and 200 metres  330 nbsp   nbsp 660 nbsp ft  above sea level.

city in the United Kingdom  urban, parkland and woodland, agricultural and
arable land, moors, meadows and freshwater based habitats. Large parts of the
city are designated as sites of special scientific interest including several
urban areas.

The present city boundaries were set in 1974, when the former county borough of
Sheffield merged with Stocksbridge Urban District and two parishes from the
Wortley Rural District. This area includes a significant part of the countryside
surrounding the main urban region. Roughly a third of Sheffield lies in the Peak
District</STYLE>
