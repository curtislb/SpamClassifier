  Joseph Chamberlain]]  Joseph Chamberlain   8 July 1836 ndash 2 July 1914  was
  an influential British businessman, politician, and statesman.

In his early years Chamberlain was a radically minded Liberal Party member, a
campaigner for educational reform, and President of the Board of Trade. He later
became a Liberal Unionist in alliance with the Conservative Party and was
appointed Colonial Secretary. At the end of his career he led the tariff reform
campaign. Despite never becoming Prime Minister, he is regarded as one of the
most important British politicians of the late 19th century and early 20th
century, as well as a colourful character and renowned orator.

He was the father of Sir Austen Chamberlain and future Prime Minister Neville
Chamberlain.


Early life, business career and marriage Chamberlain was born in Camberwell in
London to a successful shoemaker and manufacturer also named Joseph
 1796   1874 . He was educated at University College School  then still in
Euston  between 1850 and 1852, in which he excelled academically, achieving
prizes in French and mathematics. The elder Chamberlain was not able to send all
his children into higher education, and at the age of 16, Joseph was apprenticed
to the Cordwainers  Company and worked for the family business in the making of
quality leather shoes. At 18 he was sent to Birmingham to join his uncle s
screwmaking business, Nettlefolds  later part of Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds ,
in which his father had invested. In partnership with Joseph Nettlefold,
Chamberlain was to help the screwmaking firm, soon known as Nettlefold and
Chamberlain, to become a commercial success and by his retirement from the firm
in 1874, the company was exporting its products to the United States, Europe,
India, Japan, Canada and Australia. At the firm s height, Nettlefold and
Chamberlain were producing approximately two thirds of all metal screws made in
England.

In 1860, Chamberlain met and fell in love with Harriet Kenrick, the daughter of
a Unitarian family from Birmingham. In July 1861, the couple married and a
daughter, Beatrice, was born in May 1862. In October 1863, having had a
premonition that she would die in childbirth, Harriet gave birth to a son,
Joseph Austen, the future Chancellor of the Exchequer and Foreign Secretary. Two
days after Austen s birth Harriet became ill. She died three days later. Gripped
with grief, Chamberlain devoted himself to the growing fortunes of Nettlefold
and Chamberlain, whilst raising Beatrice and Austen with the Kenrick parents in 
law.

In 1868, Chamberlain married for the second time, wedding Harriet s cousin,
Florence Kenrick. The marriage was as successful and joyous for Chamberlain as
the first, and bore four children  Arthur Neville in 1869, Ida in 1870, Hilda in
1871, and Ethel, born in 1873. On 13 February 1875, Florence gave birth to their
fifth child. By the next day both she and her child had died.

Early political career Calls for reform There were strong radical and liberal
traditions among shoemakers in his adopted home city of Birmingham, while
Chamberlain s Unitarian church held a long tradition of social action. ref

Victorian City, London  Weidenfeld and Nicolson pp 232 265, 2004  ref 
Chamberlain duly became involved in Liberal politics, and the growth of
Britain s urban population during the industrial revolution led to mounting
national political pressure to redistribute parliamentary seats and to
enfranchise a sizeable proportion of urban males. In 1866, Lord John Russell s
Liberal administration put a Reform Bill before the House of Commons, aiming to
create 400,000 new voters. Whilst conservative supporters of the government,
known as  Adullamites , opposed the Bill for its disruption of the social order,
Radicals criticised it on the basis that it failed to concede the secret ballot
or household suffrage. The Bill was defeated and Lord Derby formed a minority
Conservative administration. On 27 August 1866, a vast demonstration for reform
was held in Birmingham, in which the Mayor marched alongs</STYLE>
