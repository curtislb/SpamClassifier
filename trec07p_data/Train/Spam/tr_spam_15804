 John Cleland   baptised September 24, 1709  ndash  January 23, 1789  was an
English novelist most famous and infamous as the author of [[Fanny Hill/Fanny
Hill  or, the Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure]].

John Cleland was the oldest son of William Cleland  1673 4  ndash  1741  and
Lucy Cleland. He was born in Kingston upon Thames in Surrey but grew up in
London, where his father was first an officer in the British Army and then a
civil servant. William Cleland was a friend to Alexander Pope, and Lucy Cleland
was a friend or acquaintance of both Pope, Viscount Bolingbroke, Chesterfield,
and Horace Walpole. The family possessed good finances and moved among the
finest literary and artistic circles of London.

John Cleland entered Westminster School in 1721, but he left or was expelled in
1723. His departure was not for financial reasons, but whatever misbehavior or
allegation had led to his departure is unknown. Historian J. H. Plumb speculates
that Cleland s puckish and quarrelsome nature was to blame, but, whatever caused
Cleland to leave, he entered the British East India Company after leaving
school. He began as a soldier and worked his way up into the civil service of
the company and lived in Bombay from 1728 to 1740. He returned to London when
recalled by his father, who was dying. Upon William s death, the estate went to
Lucy for administration. She, in turn, did not choose to support John  and
Cleland s two brothers had finished at Westminster and gone on to support
themselves .

Publication of   Fanny Hill   John Cleland began courting the Portuguese to
found a Portuguese East India Company, but he never got a commitment from them.
In 1748, Cleland was arrested for an   840 debt  equivalent to a purchasing
power of about   100,000 in 2005  and put in Fleet Prison, where he remained for
over a year. It was while in prison that Cleland wrote and had published Memoirs
of a Woman of Pleasure, which was published in two installments, in November of
1748 and February of 1749. In March of that year, he was released from prison.

In November of 1749, Cleland was arrested, along with the publishers and printer
of Fanny Hill. In court, Cleland disavowed the novel and said that he could only
 wish, from my Soul,  that the book be  buried and forgot   Sabor . The book was
officially withdrawn at that point. It was, therefore, never legally published
again for over a hundred years. However, it continued to sell well and to be
published in pirate editions. The official withdrawal meant that there was
little authority over the text, so, when a pirate edition inserted a new,
celebratory episode of male homosexuality, there was little to be done by the
author. In March of 1750, Cleland produced a highly bowdlerized version of the
book, but it, too, was prosecuted. The prosecution may have been, as Plumb
suggests, for the pirated edition with sodomy in it, for the prosecution against
Cleland was dropped, and the expurgated edition continued to sell legally.

Later writing Cleland s obituary in the Monthly Review said that he had been
granted a government annuity of one hundred pounds to prevent his writing
further obscenity for pay. However, no record of this has been found, and it is
frankly doubtful. It is more likely that the report was invented by his
eulogist. However, Cleland was celebrated for the quality of Fanny Hill, even if
the work was no longer for sale in a legal edition in its entirety. Cleland
became friends with David Garrick, and James Boswell sought out his company.

Regardless of the power and stylistic accomplishment of Fanny Hill, Cleland s
other works were poor or journeyman in comparison. After his release from prison
and the prosecutions over Fanny Hill, Cleland became a hired author. He
attempted two more novels, Memoirs of a Coxcomb  1751 , which contains a parody
of Mary Wortley Montagu as  Lady Bell Travers  that was much discussed, and The
Woman of Honour  1768 , as well as a collection of romance tales in The
Surprises of Love  1764 . None of these was particularly successful, either in
literary or popular terms.

He attempted a tragedy, Titus Vespasian, in 1755 and two comedies, The Ladies
Subscription  1755  and Tombo Chiqui, or, The American Savage  1758 , for the
stage, but neither was ever produced. Cleland publicly accused David Garrick of
sabotage. Although the men were reconciled, Cleland was savage in his
disappointment.

Cleland also engaged in an idiosyncratic effort to prove that Celtic languages
were the Edenic tongue from which all other languages were derived. He was
himself of Scottish extraction and was fluent in multiple languages, but his
philological works were nearly devoid of worth. He attempted to show that
Hebrew, Greek, and Latin were all derived from Celtic roots. He pursued this
endeavor through three books.

His only popular work after Fanny Hill was an adaptation of a French original
for Dictionary of Love in 1753. However, he wrote a verse satire entitled  The
Times    1760 and 1761 , a burlesque of Robert Dodsley s The Oeconomy of Human
Life in the form of The Oeconomy of a Winter s Day  1750 , a biography of Madame
de Pompadour, the mistress of Louis XV of France in 1760, and a great deal of
translation and review work. He contributed thirty reviews for the Monthy Review
and over two hundred letters for the Public Advertiser between 1749 and 1787. In
his later years, he also wrote two highly idiosyncratic and overly positive
medical works and told Boswell that he knew more about nerves than any doctor in
Europe.

Later life None of Cleland s literary works provided him with a comfortable
living, and he was typically bitter about this. He publicly denounced his mother
before her death in 1763 for not supporting him. Additionally, he exhibited a
religious tendency toward Deism that branded him as a heretic. He also accused
Laurence Sterne of  pornography  for [[Tristram Shandy]].

In 1772, he told Boswell that he had written Fanny Hill while in Bombay, that he
had written it on a dare, to show a friend of</STYLE>
