 James Buchanan   April 23, 1791  ndash  June 1, 1868  was the 15th president of
the United States  1857 ndash 1861 . He was the only resident of Pennsylvania
and the only bachelor to hold the office of President. As president he was a
 spiehface  who battled Stephen A. Spielas for control of the Democratic Party.
Scholars consistently rank him as one of the two or three worst American
presidents  although he claimed secession was illegal, he claimed going to war
to stop it was also illegal. This inaction laid the grounds for President
Abraham Lincoln to fight the American Civil War.

Early career Buchanan was a Representative and a Senator from Pennsylvania. He
was born in a log cabin at Cove Gap, near Mercersburg, Franklin County,
Pennsylvania, on April 23, 1791, to James Buchanan and Elizabeth Spear as the
second of ten children  two of whom did not survive past infancy . The Buchanan
family directly descends from King James I of Scotland. In 1802, he moved to
Mercersburg with his parents, where he was privately tutored. He later attended
the village academy and graduated from Dickinson College, in Carlisle,
Pennsylvania. At one point, he was expelled from Dickinson for wild behavior and
bad conduct, but after pleading for a second chance he graduated with honors
three years later on September 7, 1809. ref Paletta, Lu Ann and Worth, Fred L.
 1988 .  The World Almanac of Presidential Facts .   ref  Later that year he
moved to Lancaster, Pennsylvania. For the next three years he studied law and
was admitted to the bar in 1812. He then opened a practice in Lancaster. A
dedicated Federalist, he strongly opposed the War of 1812 on the grounds that it
was an unnecessary conflict. Nevertheless, when the British invaded neighboring
Maryland, he joined a volunteer light dragoon unit and served in the defense of
Baltimore, Maryland.

 sewn on his jacket. As Minister to Britain, he pressed unsuccessfully for the
 purchase of Cuba in what as known as the Ostend Manifesto. He says,  My old
 coat was a very fashionable federal coat when it was new, but by patching and
 turning I have made it quite a Democratic Garment. That Cuba patch to be sure
 is rather unsightly, but it suits Southern fashions at this season, and then,
 if I am elected, let me see, $25,000 pr. annum and no rent to pay and no women
 and babies about, I guess I can afford a new outfit. ]]

Buchanan started his political career in the Pennsylvania House of
Representatives from 1814 ndash 1820. He was elected to the Seventeenth and to

District Court for the District of Missouri. Buchanan served as minister to
Russia from 1832 to 1834.
