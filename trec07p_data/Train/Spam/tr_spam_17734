RE: Attention,


Your name and e-mail address came up in a random draw conducted by our law

my client and his entire family died in a plane crash in cotonou, Benin
Republic. You will read more stories about the crash on visiting this
Website: http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/12/26/benin.crash/ he was a
well known philanthropist before he died, he made a Will stating that
$9.2m(Nine Million Two Hundred Thousand USA Dollars Only) should be
donated to any Philanthropist of our choice overseas. We have made a
random draw where your name and e-mail address was picked as the
beneficiary to this Will.


I am particularly interested in securing this money from the bank, because
they have issued a notice instructing us to produce the beneficiary of
this Will within two weeks or else the money will be credited to the
Government treasury as per law here.


It is my utmost desire to execute the Will of our late client in your
favor and therefore, you are required to contact me immediately to start
the process of sending this money to any or your designated official
account. I urge you to contact me immediately for further details bearing
in mind that the bank has given us a date limit.

Regards,


Barrister Ethel Amako (ESQ).
