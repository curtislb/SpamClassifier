, c. 1681, below.]]  Elias Ashmole   23 May 1617 ndash 18 May 1692 , the
celebrated English antiquary, was a politician, officer of arms, student of
astrology and alchemy, and an early speculative Freemason. He supported the
royalist side during the English Civil War, and at the restoration of Charles II
he was rewarded with several lucrative offices. Throughout his life he was an
avid collector of curiosities and other artifacts. Many of these he acquired
from the traveller, botanist, and collector John Tradescant the younger, and
most he donated to Oxford University to create the Ashmolean Museum. He also
donated his library and priceless manuscript collection to Oxford.

Apart from his collecting hobbies, Ashmole illustrates the passing of the occult
philosophy in the 17th century  while he immersed himself in alchemical, magical
and astrological studies and was consulted on astrological questions by Charles
II and his court, these studies were essentially backward looking. Although he
was one of the founding members of the Royal Society, a key institution in the
development of experimental science, he never participated actively.

Solicitor and royalist Ashmole was born in Lichfield, Staffordshire. His family
had been famous, but its wealth had declined somewhat by the time of Ashmole s
birth. The family name is likely a variation in spelling of Ashmore  from  ash
moor,  also a place name , as the two spellings were used interchangeably in the
Midlands.[http   freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com  blanchec ThosASHMOLEFamily.h 
tm] His father, Simon Ashmole, was a soldier and a saddler  his mother Anne was
a cousin of James Pagit, a Baron of the Exchequer. Ashmole attended Lichfield
Grammar School and became a chorister at Lichfield Cathedral. In 1638, with the
help of Pagit, he became a solicitor. He enjoyed a successful practice in
London, and married Eleanor Mainwaring, a member of a poor but aristocratic
family, who died only three years later. Still in his early twenties, Ashmole
had taken the first steps towards status and wealth. Ashmole supported the side
of Charles I in the Civil War. At the outbreak of fighting in 1642, he left
London for the house of his father in law, Peter Mainwaring, at Smallwood in
Cheshire. There he lived a retired life until 1644, when he was appointed King s
Commissioner of Excise at Lichfield. Soon afterwards, he was given a military
post at Oxford, where he devoted most of his time to study and acquired a deep
interest in alchemy, astrology and magic. He studied physics and mathematics at
Brasenose College, Oxford, though he did not formally enroll as a student. In
late 1645, he left Oxford to accept the position of Commissioner of Excise at
Worcester.  Excise Commissioners set taxes on specific locally produced
commodities  at that time, the division between official and personal property
was not as rigorously observed as it is today, so such offices could be very
lucrative to their holders.  Ashmole was given the additional military posts of
Captain of the Horse and Comptroller of Ordnance, though he seems never to have
participated in any fighting.

Freemason

After the Royalist defeat of 1646, he retired again to Cheshire.He then met a
scholar known as Tyler Parott who helped him travel the world. During this
period, he was admitted as a Freemason  the earliest documented admission of a
Freemason in an English lodge . His diary entry for 16 October 1646 reads in
part   I was made a Free Mason at Warrington, in Lancashire, with Coll  Henry
Mainwaring, of Karincham, in Cheshire.  Although there is only one other mention
of Masonic activity in his diary he seems to have remained in good standing and
well connected with the fraternity as he was still attending meetings in 1682.
On 10 March that year he wrote   About 5 H P.M., I received a summons to appear
at a Lodge to held the next day, at Mason s Hall, London.  The following day, 11
March 1682, he wrote   Accordingly, I went   about Noone were admitted into the
Fellowship of free Masons.  And,  I was the Senior Fellow among them  it being
35 years since I was admitted .  And  We all dyned at the halfe Moone Taverne in
Cheapside, at a noble dinner prepaired at the charge of the new accepted
Masons. 

Marriage

In 1649, he married Mary, Lady Mainwaring  daughter of Sir William Forster of
Aldermaston , a wealthy thrice widowed woman twenty years his seni</STYLE>
