Hello,

My Name is Mr. George Tony. I am an accountant/auditor with intercontinental bank of England.My job is to scrutinize the business and financial records of intercontinental bank,then prepared and send annual report to intercontinental bank headqurter at London.
However,during this year financial audit of one of the intercontinental bank branchs in London, i discovered an accumulated amount of three million five hundred thousand pound sterling.(3,500,000.00 Gbp) Which has not been audits or reviewed  in the previous years. 

Meanwhile, no one else knows anything about this money and its existence except me. 
However, i have successfully transferred this amount to intercontinental bank headquarters and places  it on anON an Escrow call account where it will be easyier to be Transferred abroad.Now as an accountant/auditor of the bank i do not want to be directly linked to this fund, therefore, i am Contacting you to work with me so that I can make you the benefactor of the accountand transfer this amount into your bank account.
 
Now here are are some details:
All you need to do is to send your full name,address and contact numbers to me, and i will use the information that you provided to make you the owner/benefiary of the account.After that,i will send a sample of the request form to you and you will re-copy and send it to the bank,requesting the bank to transfer the fund to your home bank account.Belive me it is risk free,also keep this  E-mail to your self alone for security reasons.

Regards,
George Tony.
