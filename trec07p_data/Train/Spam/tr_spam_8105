Dear valued member!
This letter is a piece of advice by IPN (Internet Pharmacy Network) – officially registered organization dealing with the problem of mass drug falsification.
It’s not a secret that many Web pharmacies are trying to make profits by selling fake drugs that not only prove to be totally useless but also can cause serious health problems. USDrugs is one of very few Internet drugstores that always offer only 100% generic meds.
Hope that you will find the information provided useful.Please click here for more information.
With Best Regards,  Brian Negron
USDrugs B.V.
