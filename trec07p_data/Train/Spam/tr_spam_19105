        Dear Reader,

        In a market populated by ambitious companies with
        optimistic visions of market share and abundant success
        it is often difficult to discern those with an
        executable business plan.  It's even more difficult in
        industries where the average investor lacks the acumen
        to personally validate the company's core product line
        from a revenue perspective.

        But what can often indicate that a company indeed has
        the 'goods' is third-party validation.  One way to
        gather some understanding is to see if the emerging
        company has deals with larger companies entrenched in
        their industry. For example, MortgageBrokers.com Inc.
        (OTCBB: MBKR) announced Friday that they have begun a
        co-location initiative with RE/MAX Realtron and RE/MAX
        Hallmark, two of Canada's largest RE/MAX franchise
        offices that have an estimated CAD$3.2 billion in
        combined sales.

        In many ways this separates MortgageBrokers.com from
        unproven competitors and places them in a more
        prestigious class of performing companies.

        MortgageBrokers.com is a fast-growing mortgage
        brokerage and technology corporation dedicated to
        re-branding the over 40,000 small and medium enterprise
        (SME) mortgage broker firms in North America and
        offering these entities scalability through a
        centralized shared services platform.

           MortgageBrokers.com Begins Co-Location Program with
                        RE/MAX Ontario-Atlantic
            Franchises with Combined Sales of CAD$3.2 Billion

        TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--MortgageBrokers.com Inc.,
        (OTC BB: MBKR - News) announced today that they have
        begun a co-location initiative with RE/MAX Realtron and
        RE/MAX Hallmark, two of Canada's largest RE/MAX
        franchise offices that have an estimated CAD$3.2
        billion in combined sales. RE/MAX Hallmark and RE/MAX
        Realtron boast in excess of 1,000 real estate agents in
        14 retail locations throughout Ontario, the most
        populous province in Canada. The RE/MAX /
        MortgageBrokers.com co-location is an extension of the
        strategic alliance between the companies that was
        forged in mid 2006 after RE/MAX and its franchisees
        invested US$2.1 million in seed capital for
        MortgageBrokers.com.

        The RE/MAX/ MortgageBrokers.com co-location program
        provides a physical office location for
        MortgageBrokers.com representatives with the goal of
        allowing them to capture potential mortgage business
        from RE/MAX clientele. Based on preliminary figures,
        the Company projects to capture up to 20% in mortgage
        origination volume from these RE/MAX locations, which
        could translate into CAD$6,400,000 in gross sales
        revenue for MortgageBrokers.com.

        "This is a unique program that provides our team a
        strategic advantage over conventional online
        brokerages. Our agents have a physical presence in
        these RE/MAX locations enabling them to meet and greet
        prospective home buyers before they select and
        ultimately close on their property" said Alex
        Haditaghi, CEO and Founder of MortgageBrokers.com
        Holdings, Inc. "Signing both RE/MAX Hallmark and RE/MAX
        Realtron is a significant accomplishment for us as it
        further endorses our brand and validates our innovative
        business model" added Haditaghi.

        broker (SME) firms in North America and offering these
        entities scalability through a centralized shared

        MortgageBrokers.com's strategy is based on a vision of
        combining small and medium enterprise (SME) brokerages
        into a scalable, operating entity that can better
        compete in the industry under one recognizable brand.
        The prime objective is to improve the economic
        performance of the combined companies through the
        reduction of operating costs, the expansion of a
        national brand, the diversification of mortgage product
        lines and greater investment in technology.

        MortgageBrokers.com believes that the mortgage broker
        industry will suffer a in high interest rate
        environment unless they can streamline their overhead
        and increase their overall revenues.
        Mortgagebrokers.com allows these SME brokers to
        continue owning their own business while taking
        advantage of working under one recognizable brand;
        taking advantage of centralized services such as
        payroll and accounting, compliance, marketing,
        technology, human resources and recruitment, lead
        generation; improving access to the customer through
        strategic alliance partnerships; leveraging our
        national teams origination with lenders to establish
        higher referral fess from lenders; and, as creating the
        ability to earn ownership in a publicly-traded entity
        for their eventual career exit strategy.

                           Corporate Strategy

        Catalyzed by a peaking marketplace that will experience
        consolidation pressures from rising interest rates,
        MortgageBrokers.com, Inc. (MortgageBrokers.com™) is
        poised to experience significant growth through the
        consolidation of small and mid-sized mortgage brokerage
        enterprises (SME). MBKR expects to achieve its growth
        targets in the following four ways:

           * By providing new revenue sources, a career exit
             strategy, a platform for business growth, national
             brand equity, a developing diversified product
             offering centered around mortgage financing,
             leverage with lenders, capacity through
             centralized underwriting, and mentoring & training
             to its Small & Medium Enterprise (SME) mortgage
             agents;
           * By providing its core lenders opportunities to
             significantly improve origination cost
             efficiencies, mortgage origination volume, and
             providing a single source for improving the
             quality and integrity of a very fragmented
             origination market segment;
           *  By offering its investors an investment
             opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a
             dynamic public 'bricks & clicks' company with a
             strong management team & business model delivering
             a sustainable competitive advantage with expected
             significant annual growth opportunities for the
             next five years
           *  By focusing on its customers' satisfaction
             through providing a 'best deal' unique and
             transparent purchase experience, eliminating the
             traditional incentive structure to charge
             consumers higher rates and offering a developing
             diversified product offering centered around
             mortgage financing

                             The Opportunity

        What is the opportunity?

        There are currently over 44,000 small and medium sized
        mortgage brokerages in the United States that generate
        approximately $1 trillion dollars in mortgage volumes.
        These enterprises have traditionally built their
        business around a 'bricks and mortar' strategy, which
        has limited their growth. Under one corporate banner,
        there is an opportunity to combine their local
        community presence with a national brand. Under this
        structure we provide the consolidation of costs, allow
        for increased productivity and the opportunity for
        agents to build a career exit strategy through equity
        participation in a public company.

<p>Dear Reader,
<p>In a market populated by ambitious companies with optimistic visions
of market share and abundant success it is often difficult to discern those
with an executable business plan.&nbsp; It's even more difficult in industries
where the average investor lacks the acumen to personally validate the
company's core product line from a revenue perspective.
<p>But what can often indicate that a company indeed has the 'goods' is
third-party validation.&nbsp; One way to gather some understanding is to
see if the emerging company has deals with larger companies entrenched
in their industry. For example, <b>MortgageBrokers.com Inc. (OTCBB: MBKR)</b>
announced Friday that they have begun a co-location initiative with RE/MAX
Realtron and RE/MAX Hallmark, two of Canada's largest RE/MAX franchise
offices that have an estimated CAD$3.2 billion in combined sales.
<p>In many ways this separates MortgageBrokers.com from unproven competitors
and places them in a more prestigious class of performing companies.&nbsp;
<p>MortgageBrokers.com is a fast-growing mortgage brokerage and technology
corporation dedicated to re-branding the over 40,000 small and medium enterprise
(SME) mortgage broker firms in North America and offering these entities
scalability through a centralized shared services platform.&nbsp;

consolidation pressures from rising interest rates, MortgageBrokers.com,
Inc. (<b>MortgageBrokers.com™</b>) is poised to experience significant
growth through the consolidation of small and mid-sized mortgage brokerage

four ways:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font color="#000000">By providing new revenue sources, a career exit strategy,
a platform for business growth, national brand equity, a developing diversified
product offering centered around mortgage financing, leverage with lenders,
capacity through centralized underwriting, and mentoring &amp; training
to its Small &amp; Medium Enterprise (SME) mortgage agents;</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">By providing its core lenders opportunities to significantly
improve origination cost efficiencies, mortgage origination volume, and
providing a single source for improving the quality and integrity of a
very fragmented origination market segment;</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">&nbsp;By offering its investors an investment opportunity
to get in on the ground floor of a dynamic public 'bricks &amp; clicks'
company with a strong management team &amp; business model delivering a
sustainable competitive advantage with expected significant annual growth
opportunities for the next five years</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">&nbsp;By focusing on its customers' satisfaction
through providing a 'best deal' unique and transparent purchase experience,
eliminating the traditional incentive structure to charge consumers higher
rates and offering a developing diversified product offering centered around
mortgage financing</font></li>

<p><b><font size=+1>What is the opportunity?</font></b>
<p>There are currently over 44,000 small and medium sized mortgage brokerages
in the United States that generate approximately $1 trillion dollars in
mortgage volumes. These enterprises have traditionally built their business
around a 'bricks and mortar' strategy, which has limited their growth.
Under one corporate banner, there is an opportunity to combine their local
community presence with a national brand. Under this structure we provide
the consolidation of costs, allow for increased productivity and the opportunity
for agents to build a career exit strategy through equity participation
in a public company.
