        CanAm Uranium Corp. ("CanAm") ("CAUI") is a Nevada-incorporated junior resource company focused on the
        strategic acquisition and development of exploration properties in well-known prolific mining areas,
        especially known for uranium. CanAm properties of interest are in: Canada, Southern Africa, Australia
        and the United States. CanAm has optioned over 136,825 acres of claims collectively within the
        Saskatchewan Athabasca Basin, Ontario and British Columbia, which are significant uranium mining areas.

                                      BRINGING FUTURE ENERGY RESOURCES TO THE WORLD

        CanAm is currently drilling in the Bancroft, Ontario area. This work program consists of 1650 meters of
        drilling on a property that was once home to four past producing mines, producing a total of 14,862,653
        lbs. U3O8 between 1956 and 1982.  The 2007 CanAm exploration budget of (Cdn)$1million will include: a
        radiometric geophysical survey, ground proofing and mapping and follow-up trenching and sampling.

        CanAm holds an option to acquire up to 80% interest in eight Bancroft Uranium Projects comprising 37
        mineral claims covering an area of approximately 9,765 acres, located in the Bancroft area of
        Southeastern Ontario in Canada.  It also has options to acquire a 100% interest in BALD and OYAMA claims
        covering 1,037 hectares located in the Province of British Columbia, Canada.

          China is trying hard to corner the market on Uranium, which has helped to drive the price of uranium
                                                    through the roof

        Uranium is used primarily as an energy source for nuclear fission reactors -- a safe, efficient, and
        emission-free alternative to fossil fuels. The market cycle for uranium had been largely depressed since
        1981, but has recently experienced a sharp increase due to macroeconomic factors. An estimated supply
        shortfall of 80 million pounds per year, for several coming years, is forecast by measuring current
        annual reactor demand and current annual mine production.

        U.S.-based uranium mines produced an estimated 3 million pounds of uranium oxide (U3O8), 24 percent more
        than in 2004 and estimated U.S. uranium concentrate (yellowcake) production in 2005 was 2.7 million
        pounds of U3O8, 18 percent more than 2004.  Domestic production mills and in-situ recovery facilities
        shipped an estimated 2.7 million pounds of uranium concentrate during 2005.  The U.S. uranium sector
        glowed in 2005 with an even brighter future ahead.

                                In Canada, the uranium industry has never been stronger
                           It's a long process of finding, mining, and regulatory compliance
            and that's why so many companies are 'in the game' today so they'll be positioned for tomorrow.

                         Saudi Arabia’s Entry into Nuclear Will Accelerate the Need for Uranium

                   Civilian nuclear energy ambitions over the past twelve months have grown far beyond
             expectations and many analysts believe the natural gas and water problems of Saudi Arabia will
                                      propel them into the nuclear energy arena.
                                           That arena is dependent on Uranium.

                   CanAm Uranium Corp. Completes Transfer of Wheeler-Beckett Claims in Athabasca Basin

        LAS VEGAS, April 16, 2007 (PRIME NEWSWIRE) -- CanAm Uranium Corp. ("CanAm" or the "Company") (OTC
        BB:CAUI.OB - News) is pleased to announce that it has received notification from Saskatchewan Industry &
        Resources of the completion of title transfer for the Wheeler Beckett Claims located in the Saskatchewan
        Athabasca Basin. On November 29th 2006, CanAm acquired a 100% interest in the Wheeler Beckett Claims
        through an option agreement with Northwind Resources. Under the terms of the agreement, CanAm is
        required to pay C$250,000 and issue 1,000,000 common shares to Northwind on or before November 29th
        2007. Northwind was also granted a 2.5% NSR, of which 2% can be purchased for C$1,000,000.

        "The transfer of title puts CanAm Uranium Corp on the map in the Athabasca Basin. Officially the
        Saskatchewan Government and Third Party Map designers such as Intierra Mapping, can put our name where
        it belongs, right beside International Uranium Corp., CanAlaska, Cameco and JNR Resources Inc.," says
        Ryan Gibson, CEO. The Wheeler-Beckett Property is located 24 miles south east of the world-class
        McArthur River and Cigar Lake Mines that have a combined proven reserve of over 600 million pounds of
        uranium.

        In preparation for the Wheeler Beckett Summer Work Program, the Company is evaluating an extensive
        archive of historic data, which includes satellite geochemical and historic radiometric/gravity surveys.
        Information examined thus far strongly supports the Company's decision to fly the Wheeler-Beckett claim
        block to determine potential unconformities that could host uranium. The summer program is to consist of
        high resolution heliborne EM and radiometrics, which will be supported by a field survey and sampling
        program.

the market on Uranium, which has helped to drive the price of uranium through
the roof</font></font></b></center>

<p>Uranium is used primarily as an energy source for nuclear fission reactors
-- a safe, efficient, and emission-free alternative to fossil fuels. The
market cycle for uranium had been largely depressed since 1981, but has
recently experienced a sharp increase due to macroeconomic factors. An
estimated supply shortfall of 80 million pounds per year, for several coming
years, is forecast by measuring current annual reactor demand and current
annual mine production.&nbsp;
<p><font color="#000000">U.S.-based uranium mines produced an estimated
3 million pounds of uranium oxide (U3O8), 24 percent more than in 2004
and estimated U.S. uranium concentrate (yellowcake) production in 2005
was 2.7 million pounds of U3O8, 18 percent more than 2004.&nbsp; Domestic
production mills and in-situ recovery facilities <u>shipped an estimated
2.7 million pounds of uranium concentrate</u> during 2005.&nbsp; The U.S.
uranium sector glowed in 2005 with an even brighter future ahead.&nbsp;</font>

is pleased to announce that it has received notification from Saskatchewan
Industry &amp; Resources of the completion of title transfer for the Wheeler
Beckett Claims located in the Saskatchewan Athabasca Basin. On November
29th 2006, CanAm acquired a 100% interest in the Wheeler Beckett Claims
through an option agreement with Northwind Resources. Under the terms of
the agreement, CanAm is required to pay C$250,000 and issue 1,000,000 common
shares to Northwind on or before November 29th 2007. Northwind was also
granted a 2.5% NSR, of which 2% can be purchased for C$1,000,000.</font></font></font><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1></font></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>"The
transfer of title puts CanAm Uranium Corp on the map in the Athabasca Basin.
Officially the Saskatchewan Government and Third Party Map designers such
as Intierra Mapping, can put our name where it belongs, right beside International
Uranium Corp., CanAlaska, Cameco and JNR Resources Inc.," says Ryan Gibson,
CEO. The Wheeler-Beckett Property is located 24 miles south east of the
world-class McArthur River and Cigar Lake Mines that have a combined proven
reserve of over 600 million pounds of uranium.</font></font></font><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1></font></font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier"><font color="#000000"><font size=-1>In
preparation for the Wheeler Beckett Summer Work Program, the Company is
evaluating an extensive archive of historic data, which includes satellite
geochemical and historic radiometric/gravity surveys. Information examined
thus far strongly supports the Company's decision to fly the Wheeler-Beckett
claim block to determine potential unconformities that could host uranium.
The summer program is to consist of high resolution heliborne EM and radiometrics,
which will be supported by a field survey and sampling program.</font></font></font><font face="Courier New,Courier"></font>
