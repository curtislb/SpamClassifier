Regards

I am a nice, good looking girl. I can talk about everything. I
studied well at school and got good marks.
I am looking for a real man to share my life with him... I am strong but
I want to be safe near a real man, who is also self confident, knows
what he wants from life. I want to feel his tenderness every day and
to fulfil his life with all care and love I have.
Do you want to know me better?... -> http://loveandonly.com/winking
I will be glad to hear from you!


Sweet goodbye

Tania
