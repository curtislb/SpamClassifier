tal sum of $16,700,000.00(sixteen million seven hundred thousand United Sta=
tes Dollars) in Amsterdam,Holland to the intent of the deceased (name now w=

ptance. In your acceptance of this deal, we request that you kindly forward=
 to us your letter of acceptance; your current telephone and fax numbers an=
d a forwarding address to enable us file necessary documents at our high co=

Yours faithfully,
