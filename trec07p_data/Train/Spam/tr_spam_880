The  Wyandot , or  Wendat , are an indigenous people of North America,
originally from what is now Southern Ontario,Quebec, Canada and Southeast
Michigan. The early French explorers called the members of a four tribe
confederacy the  Huron . This name may have been applied to the Wyandot people
either from the French huron  peasant , because the Wyandot were an agricultural
people, growing corn and sunflowers  or, according to Jesuit Father Gabriel
Lallemant, the name referred to a hure, the rough haired head of wild boars. The
Wyandot homelands, near Georgian Bay, were known as Wendake.

Later, the French, particularly Jesuits such as Armand de La Richardie, learned
the Wendat language and examined their social organization. The Wyandot were
divided into various  nations,  comprising the Huron Confederacy. These nations
were four to six in number, and included the Arendarhonon, the Tahontaenrat, the
Attigneenongnahac, the Attignawantan, of whom the Ataronchronon seem to have
been a subdivision.  The Wyandot were not the only Iroquoian people in the area
to be organized into confederacies. The Petun nation, the tribes who lived
around Georgian Bay in southern central Ontario, were further divided into Bear,
Cord, Deer, and Rock tribes. To the south, on southern Lake Huron and northern
Lake Erie, were the Attiwandaronk or Neutral Indians, who were less well known
to the French. And, of course, the Iroquois themselves were a league of five
 later six  nations. 

Before the French arrived, the Wyandot had already been in conflict with the
Iroquois to the south. Once the European powers became involved, this conflict
intensified significantly. The French allied with the Wyandot, because they were
the most advanced trading nation at the time. The Iroquois tended to be allies
of the English, who took advantage of their hatred of the Wyandot and their new
French allies. The introduction of European weapons increased the severity of
wars, and, by about 1650, the Iroquois had almost completely destroyed the
Wyandot tribes. The Jesuit mission of Sainte Mudle among the Hurons, near modern
Midland, Ontario, was one focus of Iroquois attacks, and many of the Jesuit
missionaries were killed  see Canadian Martyrs   the mission was eventually
dismantled by the settlers so as to prevent capture in 1648. After a bitter
winter on Christian Island, Ontario, some Wyandot relocated near Quebec City and
settled at Wendake, Quebec.

The western Wyandot eventually re established themselves in the area of Ohio and
southern Michigan. It is this group that became commonly known to English
speakers as  Wyandots   notably in James Fenimore Cooper s novel [[Wyandotte]],
published in 1843 . In the late 18th century, the Wyandot obtained a position of
symbolic importance as the  uncles  to the Ohio Country tribes, who waged war
against the United States in the 1790s such as at the Big Bottom Massacre. Some
Wyandot of the Wyandot Nation of Anderdon still live in southern Ontario and
Michigan. However, most of the surviving people were displaced through Indian
Removal in the early 19th century, and today a large population of Wyandot  over
4,000  can be found in eastern Kansas and Oklahoma.

The approximately 3,000 Wyandot in Quebec are primarily Catholic and have French
as their first language, although there are currently efforts afoot to promote
the use and study of the Wyandot language. For many decades, a leading source of
income for the Wyandot of Quebec has been selling pottery and other locally
produced crafts.

The famous actor Edmund Kean, on his North American tour in 1825 when he was
very much vilified for scandals in his personal life, was on his arrival in
Quebec much impressed and moved with the kindness of some Wyandot tribespeople
who attended his performances. He was made chief of the tribe, receiving the
name Alanienouidet.

In 1999, representatives the far flung Wyandot bands of Quebec, Kansas, Oklahoma
and Michigan gathered at their historic homeland in Midland, Ontario, and
formally re established the Wendat Confederacy.

The historian Georges Sioui is a Wyandot from a family active in the local
politics of Wendake. Bruce Trigger was a noted scholar in Wyandot studies  in
honour of his work, he was adopted as an honorary Wyandot.

The Kansas and Oklahoma groups have fought legal battles over the Huron Indian
Cemetery in Kansas City, Kansas for over 100 years, and continue to do so in the
21st Century. The local Wyandots wish to preserve the 400 plus grave cemetery,
while the Wyandotte Nation of Oklahoma wants to use the land to establish
commercial gambling.
