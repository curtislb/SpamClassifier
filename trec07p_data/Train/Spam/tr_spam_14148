The  River Ribble  is a river that runs through North Yorkshire and Lancashire,
in the North of England. The river s watershed also includes parts of Greater
Manchester around Wigan.

The Ribble begins at the confluence of the Gayle Beck and Cam Beck near the
famous viaduct at Ribblehead, in the shadow of the Yorkshire three peaks.

It flows through Settle, Clitheroe and Preston, before emptying into the Irish
Sea between Lytham St. Annes and Southport, a length of 75 miles.

The main tributaries of the Ribble are the Hodder and Calder which join the
river near Great Mitton, the River Darwen which joins at Walton le Dale and the
River Spielas which joins near Hesketh Bank.

The Ribble Way is a long distance footpath which follows the river for much of
its course. The Ribble marked the ancient northern boundary of Mercia [http   w 
ww.merseybasin.org.uk information.asp?page 1 pagesize 5 confirmed 1 id 0 docid  
72] and at the time of the Domesday Book was the northern boundary of Cheshire.

The river is connected to both the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and the Lancaster
Canal  via the Ribble Link . The river downstream of Preston was actively
dredged when Preston was an active port  this is no longer done and silt from
the river is now spreading more widely over the  sand  beaches around Fairhaven
and St. Annes.

Its estuary forms part of the Ribble and Alt Estuaries Special Protection Area
for wildlife.

The River Ribble catchment is covered by the Mersey Basin Campaign, a
partnership which was established in 1985 to improve water quality and encourage
waterside regeneration.

Preston City Council have published controversial plans to build a barrage
across the River Ribble, in their  Riverworks  proposals. The aim of these
proposals is to build a water sports park on a section of the Ribble, coupled
with over 4000 units of high quality housing and businesses in the river s flood
plain. Some local residents are opposing these plans, arguing that they endanger
wildlife, increase flood risk to local housing and damage greenbelt areas. These
residents have set up the  Save The Ribble  campaign. Parts of the river are a
County Biological Heritage Site.

The Ribble would appear to have been known in Roman times as the
Belisama, ref Ronald Hutton  1991 . The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British
Isles. Oxford  Blackwell. p.218  ref  possibly giving its name to Samlesbury.
Ptolemy s  Belisama aest.  seems to represent the estuary of the Ribble.

The banks of the Ribble have been posited as a possible location for King
Arthur s tenth battle, on the banks of a river  Tribruit , as alluded to in his
Historia Brittonum by
Nennius[http   www.mun.ca mst heroicage issues 2 ha2lac.htm].
