Midwestern state of the United States, located in the east north central portion
of the country. It was named after Lake Michigan, whose name was a French
adaptation of the Ojibwe term mishigami, meaning  large water  or  large
lake . ref   ref  ref   ref 

Bounded by four of the five Great Lakes, plus Lake Saint Clair, Michigan has the
longest freshwater shoreline in the United States, the ninth longest total
shoreline  including island
shorelines , ref [http   coastalmanagement.noaa.gov mystate welcome.html NOAA
Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management]  ref  and more recreational
boats than any other state in the union. A person in Michigan is never more than
85 miles  137 km  from open Great Lakes water and is never more than 6 miles  10
km  from a natural water source.

Michigan is the only bi peninsular state. The Lower Peninsula of Michigan, to
which the name Michigan was originally applied, is sometimes dubbed  the
mitten,  owing to its shape. When asked where in Michigan one comes from, a
resident of the Lower Peninsula may often point to the corresponding part of his
or her hand. The Upper Peninsula  U.P.  is separated from the Lower Peninsula by
the Straits of Mackinac, a five mile channel that joins Lake Huron to Lake
Michigan. The Upper Peninsula  whose residents are often called  Yoopers   is
economically important for tourism and its natural resources.

The Upper and Lower Peninsulas are connected by the five mile long Mackinac
Bridge, which is the third longest suspension bridge between anchorages in the
world. This is the source of the name  trolls  for residents of the Lower
Peninsula, for they live  under   south of  the bridge. The Great Lakes that
border Michigan are Lake Erie, Lake Huron, Lake Michigan and Lake Superior.
Michigan also abuts Lake Saint Clair, which is between Lake Erie and Lake Huron.

History


]] Michigan was home to various Native Americans centuries before colonization
by Europeans. When the first European explorers arrived, the most populous and
influential tribes were Algonquian peoples mdash specifically, the Ottawa, the
Anishnabe  called  Chippewa  in French, after their language,  Ojibwe  , and the
Potawatomi. The Anishnabe were the most populous, estimated at between 25,000
and 35,000 within Michigan, where they were located throughout in the Upper
Peninsula and northern Lower Peninsula. The Anishabe also lived in northern
Ontario, northern Wisconsin, southern Manitoba, and northern and north central
Minnesota. The Ottawa lived primarily south of the Straits of Mackinac in
northern and western Michigan, while the Potawatomi were primarily in the
southwest. The three nations co existed peacefully as part of a loose
confederation called the Council of Three Fires. Other First Nations people in
Michigan, in the south and east, were the Mascouten, the Miami, and the Wyandot,
who are better known by their French name,  Huron . 1600s

French voyageurs explored and settled in Michigan in the 17th century. The first
Europeans to reach what later became Michigan were   tienne Br  l   s expedition
in 1622. The first European settlement was made in 1641 on the site where Father
 or P  re, in French  Jacques Marquette established Sault Sainte Mudle in 1668.

Saint Ignace was founded in 1671, and Marquette in 1675. Together with Sault Sainte 
Mudle, they are the three oldest cities in Michigan.  The Soo   Sault Ste.
Mudle  has the distinction of being the oldest city in both Michigan and
Ontario. It was split into two cities in 1818, a year after the U.S. Canada
boundary in the Great Lakes was finally established by the U.S. UK Joint Border
Commission.

In 1679, Lord La Salle of France directed the construction of the Griffin, the
first European sailing vessel on the upper Great Lakes. That same year, La Salle
built Fort Miami at present day St. Joseph.

1700s In 1701, French explorer and army officer Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac
founded Le Fort Ponchartrain du D  troit or    Fort Ponchartrain on the 
Strait    on the strait between Lakes St. Clair and Erie, known as the Detroit
River. Cadillac had convinced King Louis XIV s chief minister, Louis
Ph  lypeaux, Comte de Pontchartrain, that a permanent community there would
strengthen French control over the upper Great Lakes and repel British
aspirations.

The hundred soldiers and workers who accompanied Cadillac built a fort enclosing
one arpent ref name tbaytel   ref  ref name histdet   ref   about .85 acre, the
equivalent of just under 200 feet on a side  and named it Fort Pontchartrain.
Cadillac s wife, Mudle Th  r  se, soon moved to Detroit, becoming one of the
first white women to settle in the Michigan wilderness. The town quickly became
a major fur trading and shipping post. The     </STYLE>
