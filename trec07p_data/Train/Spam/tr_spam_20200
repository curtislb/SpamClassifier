 Jurassic Park  is a techno thriller novel written by Michael Crichton that was
published in 1990. Often considered a cautionary tale on unconsidered biological
tinkering in the same spirit as Mary Shelley s [[Frankenstein]], it uses the
mathematical concept of chaos theory and its philosophical implications to
explain the collapse of an amusement park showcasing certain genetically
recreated dinosaur species. It was adapted into a film in 1993.

The book has one sequel, [[The Lost World  Michael Crichton /The Lost World]].

Plot summary

The novel, in an  introduction , is initially presented as a brief report on the
consequences of  The InGen Incident , which occurred on August 1989. This
 fiction as fact  presentation had been used by Crichton before, in [[Eaters of
the Dead]] and [[The Andromeda Strain]]. Crichton frames his chapters between
the  iterations  of chaotic behavior predicted by the character Ian Malcolm in
his  book within a book  report.

The narrative begins by slowly tying together a series of incidents involving
strange animal attacks in Costa Rica. After paleontologist Alan Grant and his
paleobotanist graduate student Ellie Sattler enter the sequence of queried
experts they are abruptly whisked off by billionaire John Hammond  founder and
CEO of International Genetic Technologies  for a weekend visit to a  zoological
preserve  he has established on an island 120 miles off the west coast of Costa
Rica.

Recent events have spooked Hammond s considerable investors and, to placate
them, he means for Grant and Sattler to act as fresh consultants. They stand in
counterbalance to a rock star like mathematician and chaos theorist Ian Malcolm
and a lawyer representing the investors, Donald Gennaro. Both are pessimistic,
but Malcolm, having been consulted before the park s creation, is emphatic in
his prediction that the park will collapse, as it is an unsustainably simple
structure bluntly forced upon a complex system.

Upon arrival the park is revealed to contain cloned dinosaurs, which have been
recreated from damaged dinosaur DNA  found in mosquitoes that sucked Saurian
blood and were then trapped and preserved in amber  that have been spliced with
reptilian, avian, or amphibian DNA to fill in the sequence gaps. Hammond proudly
showcases InGen s secret advances in genetic engineering and parades them
through the island s vast array of automated systems.

To counter Malcolm s dire prognostications with youthful energy Hammond groups
the consultants with his grandchildren, Tim and Alexis  Lex  Murphy, who have
been sent on vacation while their parents divorce. While touring the park with
the children, Grant finds an eggshell seeming to prove Malcolm s earlier
assertion that the dinosaurs have been breeding against the geneticists  design
 the population graphs proudly introduced earlier were naturally distributed .

Malcolm suggests a flaw in their method of analyzing dinosaur populations  they
did not bother to set their software to search the motion detectors for more
than the expected number of creatures, only fewer  and the park s controllers
are reluctant to realize that the park has long been operating beyond their
constraints. Malcolm also points out the height distribution of the
Procompsognathids forms a Gaussian distribution, the curve of a breeding
population.

In the midst of this the chief programmer of Jurassic Park s controlling
software, Dennis Nedry, attempts some corporate espionage for Lewis Dodgson, a
geneticist and agent of InGen s infamous archrival, Biosyn. By activating
 trapdoors  he wrote into the system, Nedry manages to quickly steal 15 frozen
embryos from the laboratories without being detected by the island s security
systems. He then attempts to smuggle them out to a contact waiting at the
auxiliary dock deep in the park  use of the main dock would be noticed . But his
plan goes awry  during a sudden tropical storm Nedry becomes lost inside the
park and crashes his stolen jeep. He is then spat upon and blinded by a
poisonous [[Dilophosaurus]] before being eaten.

Nedry s plan called for him to secretly deliver the embryos and return to the
park s control room within fifteen minutes but, without him to quietly patch the
system, the park s security is left off, leaving the electrified fences
deactivated. Without the barriers to contain them, dinosaurs begin to escape. A
[[Tyrannosaurus rex]] attacks the people on tour, destroying the vehicles,
killing InGen public relations manager Ed Regis, and leaving Grant and the
children lost in the park.

Ian Malcolm is gravely injured during the incident but found by Gennaro and park
game warden Robert Muldoon and spends the remainder of the novel slowly dying
as, in between lucid lectures and morphine i</STYLE>
