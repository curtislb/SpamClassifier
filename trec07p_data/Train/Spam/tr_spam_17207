Dear Friend,

My name is Mr. Thomas Sanzone and I work with a Bank here in
London-England, The name of the bank is Credit Suisse Banking Group. We
had a Mr. Allen P. Copper, customer that had a deposit of US$3.5M Three
Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) before he died in a
plane crash with his wife and only Child about 7years now (January 30,
2000) and since he died, we in the Bank here have been expecting his/her
next of kin/relative(s) for the inheritance of the deposit, but none has
surfaced.

The policy of the Bank however stipulates a limited time period for such
inheritance to be made or the fund will be written off going by the record
of the incident, the time limit for the claim is closing up. In this
consideration, I am contacting you to seek for your kind understanding and
sincere co-operation to claim this inheritance for our mutual benefit.

If you can stand as the next of kin in this project, success is assured
because I am in possession of the personal file jacket of the deceased
which contains every needed information about the account and the deceased
and you and I stand no risk of any kind because I have enough information
to support you in claiming the inheritance.

The proceedings of the transaction will be shared 50% each after expenses
are reimbursed. Kindly indicate your willingness by return email and we
shall proceed with the initial step for the claim. The entire project is
expected to last for about ten working days.

Best Regards,
Mr. Thomas Sanzone
