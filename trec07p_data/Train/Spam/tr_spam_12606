The  Siamang   Symphalangus syndactylus  is an arboreal, black furred gibbon
native to the forests of Malaysia, Thailand, and Sumatra. The largest of the
lesser apes, the siamang can be twice the size of other gibbons, reaching 1 m in
height, and weighing up to 23 kg. The Siamang is the only species in the genus
 Symphalangus .

The Siamang is distinctive for two reasons. The first is that two fingers on
each hand are fused together  hence the name  syndactylus  . The second is the
large  gular sac   found in the male of the species , which is a throat pouch
that can be inflated to the size of its head, allowing the Siamang to make loud
resonating calls or songs.

There may be two subspecies of the Siamang. If so, they are the nominate
Sumatran Siamang  S. s. syndactylus  and the Malaysian Siamang  S. s.
continentis, in peninsular Malaysia . ref name Geissmann   ref  Otherwise, the
Malaysian individuals are only a population. The Siamang is the only gibbon
which occurs sympatrically with other gibbons  its two ranges are entirely
within the combined ranges of the Agile Gibbon and the Lar Gibbon.

The Siamang can live up to 30+ years in captivity.

While the illegal pet trade takes a toll on wild populations, the principal
threat to Siamang is habitat loss in both Malaysia and Sumatra. Palm oil
production is clearing large swathes of forest, reducing Siamang habitat, along
with other species such as the Sumatran Tiger.

Threats to population The Siamang, as an arboreal primate, absolutely depends on
the forest for existence, needing trees for their living. At the moment, the
Siamang is facing a population decrease due to habitat loss ref

Habitat loss A major threat to the Siamang is habitat loss due to plantation,
forest fire, illegal logging, encroachment, and human development. Firstly, palm
oil plantations have removed large areas of the Siamang   s habitat in the last
four decades. Since 2002 10.7 million hectares of palm oil have been
planted, ref name Palmer Palmer, C. E. The Extent and Causes of Illegal Logging 
An Analysis of a Major Cause of Tropical Deforestation in Indonesia. CSERGE
Working Paper.  ref  which has replaced much rainforest in Indonesia and
Malaysia, where the Siamang originally used to live. Secondly, in the last two
decades, forest fire destroyed more than 2 million hectares of Sumatran
rainforest, mainly in the lowland area where most of the Siamang live. Thirdly,
the rate of illegal logging in Indonesia increased from 1980 to 1995 and even
more rapidly after the reformation era beginning in 1998. ref name Palmer  
These illegal activities devastated the remaining tropical rainforest especially
in Sumatra. Fourthly, forest encroachments change forest cover into cultivated
land, for example  the rising price of coffee in 1998 has been encouraging
people in Sumatra to replace the forest with coffee plantation. ref
name Kinnaird   ref  Fifthly, development in many areas needs infrastructure
such as roads, which now divide a lot of conservation areas have been caused
forest fragmentation and edge effects. Unfortunately, the Siamang as an arboreal
primate faces difficulty because road establishment has disconnected their
pathways.

Poaching and hunting Unlike other parts of Asia, primates are not hunted for
their meat in Indonesia  the exception is in Chinese restaurants in Indonesia
which sometimes serve macaque on their menu . However, they are poached and
hunted for the illegal pet trade, mostly for infant Siamang. Poachers kill the
mothers because mother Siamang are highly protective of their infants. It is
therefore very difficult to remove the infant without first killing the mother.
Despite the fact that most Siamang on the market are infants many infants
nevertheless die during transportation. ref name Nursahid   ref name Nijman  

Ecology The Siamang inhabits the forest remnants of Sumatra Island and the Malay
Peninsula, and are widely distributed from lowland forest to montane forest. The
Siamang lives in groups of up to 6 individuals  4 individuals on average  with a
home range 23 hectares on average. ref name OBrien1   ref name OBrien   ref  The
Siamang s melodious choir singing breaks the forest s silence in the early
morning after the Agile Gibbon or Lar Gibbon s calls. The Siamang in Sumatra and
the Malay Peninsula are similar in appearance, but there are some differences
between Siamang in Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula in their behaviour.

Diet The Siamang mainly eats various parts of plants. The Sumatran Siamang is
more frugivorous than its Malayan cousin, with fruit making up to 60  of its
diet. The Siamang eats at least 160 species of plants, from vines to woody
plants. Its major food is figs  [[Ficus]] spp. , a member of Moraceae
family. ref name OBrien   ref name Nurcahyo Nurcahyo, A.  2001 . Daily Ranging,

prefers to eat ripe fruit rather than unripe fruit, and young leaves rather than
old leaves. It eats flowers and a few animals, mostly insects. When the Siamang
eats large flowers they will eat only the corolla  petal , but it will eat all
