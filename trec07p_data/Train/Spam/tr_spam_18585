 Oliver Cromwell   April 25 1599   September 3 1658  was an English military and
political leader best known for his involvement in making England into a
republican Commonwealth and for his later role as Lord Protector of England,
Scotland and Ireland. He was a mid gentry yeoman farmer for the first forty
years of his life  a religious conversion experience made religion the central
fact of his life and actions. A brilliant soldier  called  Old Ironsides   he
rose from the ranks to command the army. Politically he took control of England,
Scotland, and Ireland as Lord Protector, from December 16 1653 until his death.
Cromwell is a very controversial figure in English history   a regicidal
dictator to some historians  such as David Hume and Christopher Hill  and a hero
of liberty to others  such as Thomas Carlyle and Samuel Rawson Gardiner . In
Ireland, where his measures against Irish Catholics have been characterised by
many historians as genocidal or near genocidal, ref  The Troubles  Ireland s
Ordeal and the Search for Peace. Tim Pat Coogan. 2002. Page 6.  The massacres by
Catholics of Protestants, which occurred in the religious wars of the 1640 s,
were magnified for propagandist purposes to justify Cromwell s subsequent
genocide.  ISBN 13  978 0312294182  ref  ref  The Killing Trap  Genocide in the
Twentieth Century. 2005. Manus Midlarsky. Cambridge University Press. Page 361.
 ...open rebellion occurred in 1916, suggesting that nothing short of a near 
genocidal solution, as in Cromwell s day, could alter Irish Catholic Nationalist
sentiments.  ISBN 13  978 0521815451   ref  ref  Eyewitness to Irish History.
Peter Berresford Ellis. John Wiley   Sons Inc 2002. Page 108. ISBN 13  978 
0471266334.  It was to be the justification for Cromwell s genocidal campaign
and settlement.   ref  ref  Genocide in the Age of the Nation State  Volume 2.
Mark Levene. 2005. Page 55, 56   57. A sample quote describes the Cromwellian
campaign and settlement as  a conscious attempt to reduce a distinct ethnic
population . ISBN 13  978 1845110574  ref  he and his memory are widely
despised,  ref   Of all these doings in Cromwell s Irish Chapter, each of us may
say what he will. Yet to everyone it will at least be intelligible how his name
came to be hated in the tenacious heart of Ireland . John Morley, Biography of
Oliver Cromwell. Page 298. 1900 and 2001. ISBN 13  978 1421267074.  ref  ref 
 Cromwell is still a hate figure in Ireland today because of the brutal
effectiveness of his campaigns in Ireland. Of course, his victories in Ireland
made him a hero in Protestant England.

the Channel 4 History site   Cromwell s name has always been execrated by Irish
Catholics for the massacre at Drogheda. He is also hated for the transplanting
of Protestant settlers to Ireland, a policy established in the reign of
Elizabeth I.  Accessed March 2007.  ref  although amateur Irish historian and
Drogheda resident Tom Reilly has claimed that  neither Cromwell or his men ever
engaged in the killing of any unarmed civilians throughout his entire nine month
campaign . ref Tom Reilly, Cromwell  An Honourable Enemy. ISBN 13  978 
1842120804. See Author s Review on Amazon.co.uk for text.  As author of this
book, I feel that many historians in Ireland are not ready yet for  an
honourable  Cromwell   nor indeed are the people of Ireland. I thought that I
would change the history books and public opinion about this much maligned
historical figure by publishing the truth about Cromwell s Irish campaign. The
reaction   among the under forties on the whole   was good, but among historians
and the over forties it was bad. They can t seem to accept that an amateur could
discover such a fundamental flaw in Irish history ie that neither Cromwell or
his men ever engaged in the killing of any unarmed civilians throughout his
entire nine month campaign. The facts are there for all to see. But God bless
Ireland the past is still the present here and we MUST have our English hate
figures   despite the truth. How sad is that? [http   www.amazon.co.uk Cromwell Honourable Enemy Tom

Cromwell s career is full of contradictions. He was a regicide who debated
whether to accept the crown himself and decided not to   though ironically he
had more power than Charles I. He was a parliamentarian who ordered his soldiers
to dissolve parliaments. Under his rule, the Protectorate advocated religious
