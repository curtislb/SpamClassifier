<p align="right" style="margin-top:0;"><b>April 24, 2007</b></p>
<p><b>&ldquo;Snap Out of It Sheeple&trade;!&rdquo;</b></p>
<p>Have you found yourself slumped over lately, robotically moseying along and occasionally letting out a faint &ldquo;Baaaahh&rdquo;?</p>
<p>If so, you might be a member of the growing number of Sheeple&trade; infiltrating the marketplace.</p>
<p>Should you be alarmed?&nbsp;  Absolutely.&nbsp;  In fact, if you have found yourself with any of the following symptoms, <a href="http://confirm.investorplace.com/c/conf?CEJLHSLINK-3317975-7WM287-7WM287-iplacereports@speedy.uwaterloo.ca">please contact me immediately at <em>Trending123</em> here.</a></p>

<ul type="square" style="color:#006600;">
	<li><span style="color:black;">You do whatever the financial talking heads say (no matter what)</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:black;">You buy out of a stock as soon as it hits a rough patch</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:black;">You buy into a stock when, and only when, everyone else is doing it too</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:black;">You have trouble differentiating between a stock &ldquo;winner&rdquo; and a stock &ldquo;loser&rdquo;</span></li>
</ul>
<p>I assure you, if these symptoms persist, your transition from &ldquo;Peoplehood&rdquo; to &ldquo;Sheeplehood&rdquo; will only continue to worsen.&nbsp;  And your portfolios will suffer the consequences.</p>
<p>Is there a cure?&nbsp;  Of course!&nbsp;  Get the wool out of your eyes and read this carefully: You don&rsquo;t have to follow everyone else.&nbsp;  You can be the leader of your own financial destiny.&nbsp;  You can learn to expect bigger and better gains.</p>
<p>Got it?&nbsp;  Okay, let&rsquo;s smooth your transition to the newer, better side of life &mdash; where you promise to lead and not follow!</p>

<p style="margin-top:0;">Sit up and take note, &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;ve got great news for those of you who bought ALAN as I had suggested in last week&rsquo;s Trade Talk.&nbsp;  If you recall, I told you that the stock was in an Ascending Triangle pattern and looked ready to break out at a moment&rsquo;s notice.&nbsp;  The charts had been showing massive bullish divergence with all the indicators pointing up.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Well gosh darn it, ALAN is chugging along just as the charts predicted.&nbsp;  As of right now, if you bought when I urged you to do so last week, you&rsquo;d be sitting pretty with a 37% gain thus far!</p>
</div>
<p>Now that I have everyone&rsquo;s attention &mdash; here&rsquo;s another stock I am recommending you buy today:</p>

<p style="margin-top:6px;"><b>Pool Corporation (POOL)</b></p>
<p>SCP Pool Corporation operates as a wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies, equipment, chemicals, replacement parts, and complementary items in North America and Europe.&nbsp;  It offers approximately 91,000 national brand and private label products that include maintenance products, such as chemicals, supplies, and pool accessories; repair and replacement parts for cleaners, filters, heaters, pumps, and lights; packaged pool kits, including walls, liners, bracing, filters, heaters, pumps, and lights for in-ground and above-ground pools; and pool equipment and materials for new pool construction and the remodeling of existing pools.&nbsp;  SCP Pool&rsquo;s customers include swimming pool remodelers and builders; retail swimming pool stores; and swimming pool repair and service companies.</p>
<p><b style="color:#006600;">Current Outlook:</b> Now let me tell you this stock concerned a lot of people when it dipped considerably earlier this month.&nbsp;  But you know what I said in response?&nbsp;  Buy more now!&nbsp;  Considering this week it went up nearly 10% <i>AND</i> it&rsquo;s breaking the downtrend line on the weekly.&nbsp;  Not to mention the monthly, where it&rsquo;s up almost 15%!&nbsp;  So for goodness sakes, dip into this POOL, on the pullbacks!</p>

<p><b>Critical Attention Required!</b></p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I wrote about a stealth bull market &mdash; a very powerful uptrend &mdash; that most investors know nothing about.</p>
<p>At the time I told you about one specific trade that had a great chance at doubling your money over the next 4&ndash;5 months.</p>
<p>Since that time, this stock has already started its move &mdash; up 10% so far in April already!</p>
<p>You still have the opportunity to capture the lion&rsquo;s share of the profits&mdash;but you MUST take action now.&nbsp;  <a href="http://confirm.investorplace.com/c/conf?CEJLHSLINK-3317975-7WM287-7WM303-iplacereports@speedy.uwaterloo.ca">Click here to watch an important video message about this trade.</a></p>

<p><b>PPO: It&rsquo;s not just a medical plan</b></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve gone over the first two indicators we use to identify trend reversals at <em>Trending123</em>&mdash;the Aroon indicator and the Williams Percent Range (Williams %R).&nbsp;  So what&rsquo;s the third?&nbsp;  As it turns out, it&rsquo;s a three-letter abbreviation: PPO.</p>
<p>PPO stands for percentage price oscillator.&nbsp;  It&rsquo;s a lot like the MACD, but with one critical difference.&nbsp;  Both indicators calculate the difference between a shorter-term moving average and a longer-term moving average, but where the MACD expresses it as an absolute value (dollars), the PPO expresses it as a percentage.&nbsp;  For instance, a PPO of +5% means that the shorter-term moving average is 5% higher than the longer-term moving average.&nbsp;  A PPO of -5% means that the shorter-term moving average is 5% lower than the longer-term moving average.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s expressed as a percentage instead of as an absolute value, the PPO is much more reliable than the MACD, especially for long-term trends.&nbsp;  And that&rsquo;s why we can use it to help identify trend reversals: When the PPO rises above zero, it&rsquo;s bullish, and when it falls below zero, it&rsquo;s bearish.&nbsp;  Now isn&rsquo;t that as easy as 1, 2, 3?</p>
