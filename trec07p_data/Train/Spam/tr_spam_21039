The  University of London  is a university based primarily in London. It is the
second largest university in the United Kingdom  after the Open University ,
with 125,000 campus based students and a further 41,000 in the University of
London External Programme. Established by Royal Charter in 1836, the university
includes some of the most prestigious colleges and institutes of higher
education in the world.

Overview The university is a federal body made up of 31 affiliates  18 colleges
and 13 institutes . The ten most famous colleges are Birkbeck College,
Goldsmiths, Imperial College London, King s College London, the London Business
School, the London School of Economics, Queen Mary, Royal Holloway, the School
of Oriental and African Studies, and University College London.

For most practical purposes, ranging from admission of students to negotiating
funding from the government, the 18 constituent colleges are treated as
individual universities. Within the university federation they are known as
Recognised Bodies, with the authority to examine students and have the
university award them degrees. One of the conditions of membership of the
University of London federation is that colleges do not award degrees of their
own. At present Imperial College, UCL, LSE and King s College London retain this
power, but have yet to use it.

The thirteen institutes, or Listed Bodies, within the University of London offer
courses leading to degrees that are both examined and awarded by the University
of London. Additionally, twelve universities in England, several in Canada and
many in other Commonwealth countries  notably in East Africa  began life as
associate colleges of the university offering such degrees. By the 1970s almost
all of these colleges had achieved independence from the University of London.
An increasing number of overseas academic institutes offer courses to support
students registered for the University of London External Programme s diplomas
and degrees, although no affiliation, accreditation, validation, recognition or
franchise arrangements with those institutions.

Location

The University of London owns a considerable estate of 160 buildings centred on
the Bloomsbury district of central London. ref   ref . Some of the University s
colleges have their main buildings on the estate. The Bloomsbury campus also
contains eight Halls of Residence and Senate House, which houses the
[http   www.shl.lon.ac.uk  Senate House Library], the chancellor s official
residence and the School of Slavonic and East European Studies. By 2008, almost
all of the School of Advanced Study will be in Senate House and neighboring
Stewart House. ref   ref 

The estate includes several properties outside Bloomsbury, including the
University Marine Biological Station, Millport on the Isle of Cumbrae, a
boathouse on the Chiswick embankment, a number of self catering units further
afield, which together house nearly 3,000 students, and the full premises of the
University of London Institute in Paris.

Many of the University s college and institutes are outside Bloomsbury  those
normally own their own estates.

History

 and published in 1827 28. This building is now part of University College
 London, which today is one of the many constituent colleges and institutes of
 the University of London.]]

Founded in 1836, the university at first comprised just two colleges  University
College London, which previously had no official chartered status and did not
apply religious tests to its students, and King s College London, which had been
chartered since 1829 and which admitted only members of the Church of England.
Both King s  founded 1829  and University College London  founded 1826  pre date
the University of London, which initially served solely as an examining body for
the constituent colleges.

In 1858 the university expanded its role by offering the University of London
External Programme to candidates outside of the colleges, the first of its kind
in the country. A new headquarters at 6 Burlington Gardens, providing the
university with exam halls and offices, was built to accommodate the new role.
In 1878 the university set another first when it became the first university in
the UK to admit women on equal terms with men. Four female students obtained
Bachelor of Arts degrees in 1880 and two obtained Bachelor of Science degrees in
1881, again the first in the country. ref [http   www.london.ac.uk history.html
University of London Brief history]  ref 

In 1898, in part as a response to criticisms of universities which merely served
as centres for the administration of tests, and calls for research and education
to be more central functions of universities, the first University of London Act
was passed, reforming the university and giving it responsibility for monitoring
course content and academic standards within </STYLE>
