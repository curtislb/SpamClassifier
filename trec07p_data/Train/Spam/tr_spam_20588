The  University of Sunderland  is located in the City of Sunderland in North
East England. The University has over 16,000 students, including over 1,000
international students from about 70 countries.

The University was announced as the [http   myblogs.sunderland.ac.uk blogs ablo 
gus 2006 01 times_higher_names_sunderland.html  Best English University for
student experience ] by the Times Higher Education Supplement in December 2005.

The University is also one of the 31 United Kingdom Universities providing the
New Route PhD as an alternative to the traditional Ph.D., although Sunderland
also provides the latter.

History The University   s roots can be tracked back to 1901, where Sunderland
Technical College was established as a municipal training college on Green
Terrace  the site of the current Priestman Building . It was the first to offer
sandwich courses. Naval architecture and pharmacy were introduced between the
two World Wars.

In the late 1950s, the college was the first educational centre in the region to
install a digital computer.

A new complex of buildings on nearby Chester Road was opened by HRH Prince
Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, in 1964.

 Sunderland polytechnic  was established on 1 January 1969, incorporating the
Technical College, the School of Art and, later, Sunderland Teacher Training
College. In 1992 it gained University status when the City of Sunderland was
granted city status.

The University was recognised by [[The Guardian]] as England s best new
university in 2001, and in 2005 was named by [[The Times Higher Education
Supplement]] as the top university in England for providing the best student
experience.

, 2006 at the School of [http   osiris.sunderland.ac.uk  Computing and
Technology] Awards Ceremony.]]

Current Lord Puttnam became the university s first Chancellor in 1998. The
Sunderland Empire Theatre was the regular venue for the graduation ceremonies,
although they have been hosted at the Stadium of Light since 2004.

There are currently two main campuses, City Campus and the Sir Tom Cowie Campus
at St Peter s, with other buildings in Ashbrooke. St Peter s opened during the
1990s on the northbank of the River Wear, the site of St. Peter s Church and
monastery built by Benedict Biscop in 674AD. In September 2002 the campus was
renamed  The Sir Tom Cowie Campus at St. Peter s  after the local businessman
who was one of the University s primary supporters. The Sunderland Business
School is similarly named  The Reg Vardy Centre , and another building,
primarily used by the School of Computing and Technology, is  The David Goldman
Informatics  Centre.

 The Media Centre , housing television and radio production facilities for the
School of Arts, Design Media and Culture, along with a small local base for Tyne
Tees Television, opened in 2003 at St. Peter s. It was officially opened in
March 2004 by Estelle Morris. Morris has been the pro vice chancellor since June
2005.

The City Campus complex is still used, with buildings constantly being
redeveloped. The Edinburgh Building was extensively redeveloped in 2004, and
given a modern frontage. An elevator was installed in Forster Building in 2003
when it started to house the School of Education and Lifelong Learning. The
towering Wearmouth Hall, however, is no longer used for student accommodation,
but is still for lectures and catering facilities, as well as to accommodate
some of the University of Sunderland Students  Union offices.

The David Goldman Informatics Centre, St. Peter s Campus A live webcam inside of
the School of Computing and Technology is [http   argus.sunderland.ac.uk 
available here].

This building holds a large collection of computers including sun solaris
machines and windows machines. The building contains several cisco labs all of
which have cisco switches and routers to help students completing cisco
certifications. The building was previously a 24 7 building but in the winter of
2006 2007 the building was changed to be open until 9pm only. The closure of the
building caused slight concern among a large amount of the students who made
numerous requests to have the building changed back to a 24 7 building, this
reulted in the building being re opened in March 2007 until the start of easter
2007.

Halls of Residence Scotia Quay and Panns Bank student halls of residence are
based across the River Wear from St. Peter s Campus, directly across the road
from The Bonded Warehouse. The location of these halls used to be one of the
many locations on the river that were used by the old ship building industry.

Students Union The University of Sunderland Students  Union has 3 large bars,
the Bonded Warehouse, Wearmouth Hall and Manor Quay.

Manor Quay  located at the St. Peters Campus  is currently open on four nights
during the week hosting various events. Bonded Warehouse is located next to
Panns Bank university accommodation. Wearmouth Hall serves the city campus,
located within the Edinborough building on the campus.

The student magazine is called DN  Degrees North  magazine and it s highly
successful student run radio station is called  Utopia FM 

The Gateway  the new university building on the city campus  now has a Greggs 

Schools and service departments The University has five academic departments
 schools , responsible for teaching and learning, academic development and
research, and working with partners in business and industry. The University
also has a Graduate Research School which provides a focus and catalyst for
