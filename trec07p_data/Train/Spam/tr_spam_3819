Dear Sir/Ma,

I am Mr Tai Lee Yeung, I own a company Based on Chinese and African
textile and fabric material in Australia, I'm in search for a 
trustworthy representative in USA that can help as a link between me 
and my 
clients over there.I would like to know if your are interested to work 
from 
home for us at Tai Textile MFG.

Urgently i need a representative in the states,that will work online 
from home and get paid weekly without leaving or affecting your present 
job? My Company produces various clothing materials, batiks, assorted 
fabrics and traditional costumes.We have clients we supply weekly in 
the 
states and my clients make payments for our supplies every week
in form of money orders,cashiers check and bank To Bank transfer. which 
are not readily cashable outside the US or Canada,so I need a honest 
and sincere individual in the States to work as my representative and 
assist me in processing the payments from our clients and I will pay 
him/her 10% per each payment recieved on my behalf,you are likely to 
recieve 
payments once per week.

AN IDEA OF WHAT YOU ARE EXPECTED TO TAKE CARE OFF

Receive payments from my patronizing customers in the States on my 
behalf and get it cashed at your bank, then deduct 10% from the total 
funds 
recieved as your workmanship and forward the balance to me Via Western 
Union Money Transfer.(the transfer charges should also be deducted from 
the total amount your sending to me).

Sheryl Shavers (my former representative has moved to Germany with her 
family)
Our payments will be issued out in your name and sent to your contact
address.  So all I need is to forward your information to my numerous 
customers
in the states and they will contact you before they issue payment in
form of money order to you.


Hope to get a favourable reply ,accepted to be my rep and get back to
me with the following informations in this format.
