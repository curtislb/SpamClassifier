Dear valued member.
We are writing to inform you about the result of the recent research concerning the quality of the drugs sold on the Internet.
So far, the experts of our Association has been dissatisfied with the quality of almost all the Web pharmacies that we have been investigating. Actually, the only pharmacy we can recommend you is USDrugs – the only e-shop we’re constantly monitoring thus reducing the danger of drug falsification to the minimum.
Remember! Taking generic drugs you will secure yourself against poisoning!
