The  Bearded Collie  or  Beardie  is a herding breed of dog, once used primarily
by Scottish shepherds, but these days mostly a popular family companion, bred
almost exclusively for dog shows.

History It is difficult to distinguish between fact and legend in looking at the
history of a breed, but it is believed that Kazimierz Grabski, a Polish
merchant, traded a shipment of grain for sheep in Scotland in 1514, and brought
six Polish Lowland Sheepdogs to move the sheep. A Scottish shepherd was so
impressed with the herding ability of the dogs that he traded a few sheep for a
few dogs. These were bred with the local Scottish dogs to produce the Bearded
Collie.

What everybody seems to agree upon is that Mrs. G. Olive Willison founded
today s breed with her brown bitch Jeannie of Bothkennar. Jeannie was supposed
to have been a Shetland Sheepdog, but by mistake Mrs. Willison received a
Bearded Collie instead. She got so fascinated by the dog that she wanted to
start breeding, so she started looking for a mate for her Jeannie. A man she met
one day while walking along the beach was about to emigrate from Scotland, so
Mrs. Willison became the owner of his grey dog David, who was to become Bailie
of Bothkennar.

These two dogs are what we today refer to as the founders of the modern breed
and there are but a few other registerable blood lines, preserved in large part
by the perseverance of Mr. Nicolas Broadbridge  Sallen  and Mrs. Betty Foster
 Bredon . These are based on a dog named Turnbull s Blue, a bearded collie from
pure working stock registered in [http   www.isds.org.uk  ISDS], at the time
when ISDS still registered non border collies. He fathered three litters of
registerable bearded collies.

The breed has become more and more popular over the last half of the 20th
century, in part propelled by a Bearded Collie,  Potterdale Classic at
Moonhill , winning Best in Show at Crufts in 1989. The Bearded Collie Club
celebrated its Golden Jubilee year in 2005  where  Bumbleridge Original Oka 
 Bred by Sue Nichols Ward, Owned by Sue Unsworth   Andy Miller  won the  Most
Handsome Bearded Collie  event.

Bearded Collies as Pets The Bearded Collie ranks 104 out of 155 breeds in
popularity in the United States, according to the American Kennel Club s yearly
publishing of breed rankings.  ref name  AKC
