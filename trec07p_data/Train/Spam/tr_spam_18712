 Robert Laurence Binyon   August 10, 1869 at Lancaster  ndash  March 10, 1943 at
Reading, Berkshire  was an English poet, dramatist and art scholar. His most
famous work For the Fallen is well known for being used in Remembrance Sunday
services.

Life   works The son of Quakers, Binyon was educated at St Paul s School and
Trinity College, Oxford. He was already writing poetry by 1890, and won the
Newdigate Prize for one poem whilst still at Oxford.

After graduation, from 1893 he worked at the Department of Printed Books in the
British Museum. In 1904 he married fellow historian Cicely Margaret Powell, and
the couple had three daughters. He later moved to the Museum s Department of
Prints and Drawings, becoming the Assistant Keeper of Prints and Drawings in
1909. In 1913 he was made the Keeper of the new Sub Department of Oriental
Prints and Drawings. Many of his books produced while at the Museum were
influenced by his sensibilities as a poet, although some are works of plain
scholarship   such as his four volume catalogue of all the Museum s English
drawings.

Although too old to enlist in the First World War, he went to the Western Front
in 1916 to work for the Red Cross as a medical orderly with an Ambulance Unit.
He wrote about his experiences in For Dauntless France  1918 .

Today Binyon is most famous for his poem For the Fallen often recited at
Remembrance Sunday services in the UK, and an integral part of all Anzac Day
services in Australia and New Zealand.

Music Edward Elgar set Binyon s poems to music as The spirit of England  op. 80,
for tenor or soprano solo, chorus and orchestra  1917 .

Post war life After the war, he returned to the British Museum and wrote
numerous books on art  in particular on William Blake, Persian art, and Japanese
art. His work on ancient Japanese   Chinese cultures offered strongly
contextualised examples that inspired, among others, the poets Ezra Pound, and
W.B. Yeats. His work on Blake and his followers kept alive the then nearly 
forgotten memory of the work of Samuel Palmer. Binyon s duality of interests
continued the traditional interest of British visionary Romanticism in the rich
strangeness of Mediterranean and Oriental cultures.

In 1931 his two volume Collected Poems appeared. In 1933, he was appointed
Norton Professor of Poetry at Harvard. In 1934 he retired from the British
Museum, having risen to be the Keeper of the Prints and Drawings Department, and
went to live in the country at Westridge Green, near Streatley  where his
daughters also came to live during the Second World War .

As well as writing poetry Binyon continued his academic work  in May 1939 he
gave the prestigious Romanes Lecture in Oxford on Art and Freedom, and in 1940
he was appointed the Byron Professor of English Literature at University of
Athens. He worked there until forced to leave before the German invasion of
Greece in April 1941.

Binyon had been friends with Ezra Pound since around 1909, and in the 1930s the
two became especially friendly   Pound affectionately called him  BinBin , and
closely assisted Binyon with his Dante translation work. Another Binyon protege
was Arthur Waley, whom Binyon employed at the British Museum. Binyon also
introduced Robert Frost to the young Robert Bridges.

Between 1933 and 1943, Binyon published an acclaimed translation of Dante s
[[Divina commedia]] in an English version of [[terza rima]]. At his death he was
also working on a major three part Arthurian trilogy  the first part of which
was published after his death as The Madness of [[Merlin  wizard /Merlin]]
 1947 .

There is a slate memorial at Aldworth, St. Mary s Church, where Binyon s ashes
were scattered after death.

His daughter  Helen Binyon   1904 1979  was an artist who studied with Paul Nash
and Eric Ravilious. She illustrated many books for the Oxford University Press,
and was also a marionettist. She later taught puppetry and published Puppetry
Today  1966  and Professional Puppetry in England  1973 .
