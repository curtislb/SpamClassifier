 Finches  are passerine birds, often seed eating, found chiefly in the northern
hemisphere and Africa. One subfamily is endemic to the Neotropics. The family
scientific name  Fringillidae  comes from the Latin word  fringilla , meaning
chaffinch, a member of this family that is common in Europe. The taxonomic
structure of the true finch family, Fringillidae, is somewhat disputed, with
some including the Hawaiian honeycreepers as another subfamily  Drepanidinae 
and or uniting the cardueline and fringilline finches as tribes  Carduelini and
Fringillini  in one subfamily  the euphonious finches were thought to be
tanagers due to general similarity in appearance and mode of life until their
real affinities were realized  the buntings and American sparrows were formerly
considered another subfamily  Emberizinae . Przewalski s  Rosefinch 
 Urocynchramus pylzowi  is now classified as a distinct, monotypic family with
no particularly close relatives  Groth 2000 .

 Classic  or true finches are small to moderately large and have strong, stubby
beaks, which in some species can be quite large. All have 12 tail feathers and 9
primudles. They have a bouncing flight, alternating bouts of flapping with
gliding on closed wings, and most sing well. Their nests are basket shaped and
built in trees. The true finches range in size from the Andean Siskin  Carduelis
spinescens , at 9.5 cm  3.8 inches  and 8.4 g., to the Collared Grosbeak
 Mycerobas affinis , at nearly 23 cm  9 inches  and 79 g.  2.8 oz .

There are many birds in other families which are often called finches. These
include many species in the very similar looking Estrildids or waxbill family,
which occur in the Old World tropics and Australia. Several groups of the
Emberizidae family  buntings and American sparrows  are also named as finches,
including the Darwin s finches of the Galapagos islands, which provided evidence
of Darwin s theory of evolution.

Systematics The systematics of the cardueline finches are contentious. The
layout presented here follows the molecular studies of Marten   Johnson  1986 
and Arnaiz Villena et al.  1998, 2001 , and takes into account the traditional
splitting of the genus Carduelis. The exact position of several genera in the
cardueline sequence is tentative.

Family Fringillidae      See also Groth  1994. J. f  r Orn. 135 31  which is the
eariest work suggesting some recently verified changes. Vaurie, 1956, Amer. Mus.
Novit. No. 1775 is probably obsolete.      Subfamily  Fringillinae   
 Fringilline  finches  contains only four species, which feed their young on
insects rather than seeds.   Genus [[Fringilla]]   Bramblings and chaffinches
   Chaffinch  Fringilla coelebs     Blue Chaffinch  Fringilla teydea 
   Brambling  Fringilla montifringilla 

 Subfamily  Carduelinae     Cardueline  finches  a much larger group that
contains several genera which feed their young on seeds.     Condor107 775
