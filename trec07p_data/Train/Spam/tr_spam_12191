, such as York Minster.]]

 City status in the [[United Kingdom]]  is granted by the British monarch to a
select group of communities. The status does not apply automatically on the
basis of any particular criteria, although in England and Wales it was
traditionally given to towns with diocesan cathedrals. This association between
having a cathedral and being called a city was established in the early 1540s
when Henry VIII founded dioceses  and therefore cathedrals  in six English towns
and also granted them all city status by issuing Letters Patent.

History Until the 16th century, a town was recognised as a city by the English
Crown if it had a diocesan cathedral within its limits. This means some cities
today are very small, because they were unaffected by population growth during
the industrial revolution     notably Wells  population about 10,000  and St
David s  population about 2,000   see Smallest cities in the United Kingdom .
After the sixteenth century, no new dioceses  and no new cities  were created
until the nineteenth century, but the practice was revived with the creation of
the diocese of Ripon in 1836. A string of new dioceses and cities followed. This
process was changed in 1888 to allow Birmingham and other large settlements that
did not have cathedrals to become cities  Birmingham s parish church later
became a cathedral .

The presence of a cathedral in a Scottish town before the Reformation led often,
but not universally, to its recognition as a city. Dornoch, for instance, has
never generally been called a city despite having had a pre Reformation
cathedral. The status of royal burgh was, in terms of privileges, more relevant
in Scotland than the status of city. After the Reformation, city status
crystallized and no changes were made until the nineteenth century.

City status in Ireland tended historically to be granted by royal charter. There
are many towns in Ireland with Church of Ireland cathedrals which have never
been called cities. In spite of this, the seat of the Primate of All Ireland,
Armagh, was considered a city  despite its never having been granted a charter 
until this status was lost in a local government reorganization in the
nineteenth century. The only historic city with a charter in present day
Northern Ireland is Derry, which was renamed  Londonderry  by its city charter.

City status conferment City status is conferred by letters patent and not by a
royal charter  except historically in Ireland  but there are some cities in
England and Wales that predate the historical monarchy, and have been regarded
as cities since  time immemorial .

The holding of city status brings no especial benefits other than the right to
be called a city. All cities have to be re issued with letters patent
reconfirming city status following local government re organisation where the
original city has been abolished. This process was followed by a number of
cities since 1974, and York and Hereford s status was confirmed in both 1974 and
again in the 1990s. Failure to do so leads to the loss of city status as
happened at Rochester in 1998  see below , and also previously in St. David s
and Armagh, although both of these latter have regained city status since losing
it. All three of these had been cities since time immemorial before the loss of
city status.

Charters originated as charters of incorporation, allowing a town to become an
incorporated borough, or to hold markets. Some of these charters recognised
officially that the town involved was a city. Apart from that recognition, it
became accepted that such a charter could make a town into a city. The earliest
examples of these are Hereford and Worcester, both of which date their city
status to 1189.

The formal definition of a city has been disputed, in particular by inhabitants
of towns that have been regarded as cities in the past but are not generally
considered cities today. Additionally, although the Crown clearly has the right
to bestow  official  city status, some have doubted the right of the Crown to
define the word  city  in the United Kingdom. In informal usage,  city  can be
used for large towns or conurbations that are not formally cities. The best 
known example of this is London, which contains two cities  the  [[City of
London]] , and the  [[City of Westminster]]   but is not itself a city.

Officially designated cities There are currently 66 officially designated cities
in the UK, of which eight have been created since 2000 in competitions to
celebrate the new millennium and Queen Elizabeth II s Golden Jubilee. The
designation is highly sought after, with over 40 communities submitting bids at
recent competitions.

Modern practice of granting city status Towns that became seats of bishoprics in
the twentieth century, such as Chelmsford, Guildford, and Blackburn, were not
automatically granted city status. However, well into the twentieth century it
was often assumed that the presence of a cathedra</STYLE>
