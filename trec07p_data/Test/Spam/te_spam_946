            <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Has never biked through the Andes on his Harley, but he and his wife want to go. &quot;When you travel a country on a Hog, folks make a point of talking to you.

Reporters declare him &quot;curmudgeonly&quot; but he despises the media circus. &quot;Everyone's got an angle they're trying to push. Even the journalists. I don't have an angle.

            <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Devoted follower of Graham and Dodd, the founding fathers of financial analysis. Graham's definition of an investment is taped to Young's computer. It says, &quot;An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and satisfactory return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.&quot; Young's <i>Intelligence Report</i> is so named as a tip-of-the-hat to Graham's most important work, The Intelligent Investor.</font></p>
            <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gave up a career on Wall Street as one of its most respected analysts and traders. &quot;In the end, the herd mentality is too strong to resist. Living in the countryside, I can maintain my independence of outlook and help the people I admire--individual investors.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Earned his B.S. in investments from Babson College, where he has served as investment advisor to the Board of Trustees.</font></p>
            <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">His first job was as a Wall Street runner, earning $60 a week.</font></p>
            <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lost $5,000 once. &quot;It wasn't an investment. It was a speculation.&quot; That was the first and last time in over 36 years of investing that he became confused about the difference.</font></p>
            <p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sees Young's <i>Intelligence Report</i> as his life-work. &quot;I can make a real, lasting difference to so many private investors this way.

      <p><b>If  you didn&rsquo;t double,</b> triple or quadruple  your money in the last 5 years in the great bull market in <i>things</i>&mdash;commodities  like gold, copper, steel, coal, uranium, oil or natural gas, please read every  word of this urgent report.</p>
      
      <p>Indeed,  if you are not sitting down and ready to take notes right now, PLEASE LAY THIS  REPORT ASIDE until this evening, when you can review it carefully and make some  very important decisions.</p>
      
      <p>You  may feel you missed out on the great commodities bull market of the last 4  years and that, in any case, commodities are too risky for a conservative  investor like you.</p>
      
      <p>But  you are mistaken on both counts.</p>
      
      <p>And  in fact a commodity laggard&mdash;agriculture&mdash;is just <i>beginning</i> its amazing bull run.</p>
      
      <p>Best  of all, new ETF funds make investing in commodities as diverse as biofuels,  timber or corn a snap.</p>
      
      <h3 align="center"><b>Time  To Take Another<br>
      </b><b>Bite  of The Apple</b></h3>
      <p>Allow  me to introduce myself.</p>
      <p>My  name is Dick Young and I would like to tell you <i>exactly</i> how to achieve your most ambitious financial goals  in the next 36 months, and do it in natural resource stocks.</p>
      
      <p>This  is a very practical guide.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m  going to lay out as much of my plan as possible in the next few pages and then  I&rsquo;m going to show you what first steps you must take.&nbsp; To make sure we get the job DONE, I&rsquo;m going to stick with  you FOR THE WHOLE YEAR.</p>
      
      <p>By  that time, you could be well on your way to achieving your goals. </p>
      
      <p>Well  on your way to reaching your dreams without EVER, even for one second, becoming  a speculator.</p>
      
      <p>And  you will have done it by investing conservatively in&hellip;commodity stocks.</p>
      
      <h3 align="center"><b>One  Thing I Do Require</b></h3>
      <p>I&rsquo;ve  already said I don&rsquo;t need you to be a speculator.&nbsp; In truth, risk-takers appall me.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t make friends with traders and they consider me a  terrible stick-in-the-mud.</p>
      
      <p>But  the very <i>thought</i> of losing a dollar on  an investment fills me with dread.&nbsp;  Once, when I was a young Wall Street runner in the &lsquo;60s, I lost $5,000  on a speculation.&nbsp; That experience  made me so <i>physically</i> sick, I  made a solemn vow never to let it happen again.</p>
      
      <p>And  it hasn&rsquo;t.</p>
      
      <h3 align="center"><b>No  Dreamers, Please</b></h3>
      <p>I have put a lifetime of study into success.&nbsp; Success of every stripe.</p>
      
      <p>What,  for example, makes the Rolling Stones successful?&nbsp; That is not a question most investment advisors would think  to ask, is it?&nbsp; The answer in The  Stones&rsquo; case is Andrew Oldham, the man who literally locked Jagger and Richards  in his kitchen to force them to write their own songs.</p>
      
      <p>In  a world of one-hit wonders, the Stones keep rolling, keep on message, and just  get more and more successful.</p>
      
      <p>That&rsquo;s  how I work and that is how I expect you to work with me.&nbsp; <i>Success compounds success&mdash;</i>that&rsquo;s what I have learned over the last 35 years of  professional investing.</p>

      <h2><font color="#003399" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Step One: The Great Sugar Rush</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
          <img src="http://images.investorplace.com/e_images/ryir/comm/up134.gif" width="202" height="67"> </font></h2>
      <p>In 1974, the price of sugar was 66  cents.&nbsp; Then it collapsed to almost  2 cents in 1985.&nbsp; For the next  decade, sugar was stuck at a dime or less.</p>
      <p>In  the last few months, the price of sugar has doubled&mdash;and the value of a white  sugar futures contract has quadrupled.</p>
      
      <p>This  breakout has been two decades in the making:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>First, Brazil got smart and decided to dominate sugar  production while stabilizing prices by diverting all over-supply into ethanol.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, sugar demand rose 63% in the last 20 years,  largely driven by huge increases in consumption in Asia.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>And supply has shrunk in Europe, Africa, even Asia.  Exports of sugar from the EU, for example, have collapsed from 7 million tonnes  a year in 2005 to less than <i>one </i>million  in 2007.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>And finally, oil prices went stratospheric&mdash;and remain  so high, sugar-based ethanol prices are up over 250% since mid 2004!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The case for sugar  is compelling today, but I <i>don&rsquo;t</i> want  you running around out there trying to buy sugar futures!&nbsp; Employ a new ETF fund to do that for  you.&nbsp; The one I have selected works  on a formula that cushions the effect of monthly contracts rolling at very  different prices.&nbsp; </p>

      </table>
      <p>Unless you have a  cast-iron stomach, you need that.</p>
      
      <p>If sugar has been  so low, so long, isn&rsquo;t a collapse possible again?&nbsp; Yes&mdash;if Asia stops growing.&nbsp; Yes&mdash;if the price of a gallon of gas goes back to 33  cents.&nbsp; </p>
      
      <p>Those are odds I  find very acceptable.</p>

					<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Get A Grip On The New
        Reality</strong></font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you really, truly
        want to make remarkably safe, fast profits--not just dream about it, but really
        DO IT--then you must come to grips with
        the central theme of our time: we are at war. A world
        war. It is a war, like all wars, of Havenots against Haves. The difference between the
        Haves and Have-nots is not difficult to define. The average wage of a Chinese
        laborer, gluing MacDonald's Happy Meal toys together in suffocating labor
        camps, is 60 cents an hour. A few hours away, in Singapore or Australia, the
        average wage is
        $6.70 an hour.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Or consider Central
        America. The average Nicaraguan makes $2,400 a year. A few miles across the
        jungle, a Costa Rican makes $10,100.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Uranium is one
        commodity the Havenots desperately want (there are many others, as we shall
        see, and each

        America was still building nuclear reactors and the arms race was in full
        swing, uranium hit $43 a pound--so until recently, it has been a long bear market.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But a uranium shortage of huge magnitude is developing so quickly that many of the earth's most critical nuclear power plants could face the risk of imminent SHUTDOWN.&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nearly 200 million
        pounds of uranium is needed this year to keep the lights on in France, China,
        the U.K. and U.S.A. But only 100 million pounds will be mined.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And meanwhile, China is
        building FORTY new reactors!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And with reactor
        shut-downs come blackouts, a global economic seizure, political unrest, and
        oil prices at home you
        don't even want to think about!</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Uranium prices,

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But still, prices are

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you want to see
        this dirty bomb used at its cruelest, consider what "Father Joseph" Putin did
        in February 2004. He simply cut off the gas pipelines to Belarus. It was
        exactly what it appeared
        to be--an act of terrorism--a guerrilla maneuver in the greater

					<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Every investor needs to understand--and invest maybe just a little--in alternative energy. This might mean wind power (General Electric, with its turbines, is the way to go here), biorefineries or ethanol.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But my money's on coal.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yes--coal.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here at Young's <em>Intelligence Report</em>, we've doubled our money in coal stocks just in the last year, but we very well could double that double in the next year. Here's why.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A new process takes low-grade, water-logged, $6-a-ton Western U.S. coal, and converts into a clean liquid fuel worth the equivalent of $60 a barrel.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The process is expensive but several factors make K-fuel, as it's called, work:</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It cuts our dependency. The American west sits atop a larger store of energy than Saudi Arabia. It's simply in the form of coal, not oil. Some of the coal is high quality and where it is, you should invest. No less than 140 new coal-fired power plants are about to be built.&nbsp; This is more than at any time since the 1950s. Coal is the new favorite alternative to oil. Here at Young's <i>Intelligence Report</i> we've been getting fat on a Canadian coal trust that produces super high-grade coal and returns the profits to us in the form of a 11.3% yield. Very nice.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's clean. Coal's big drawback has always been that it burns dirty. Clean it up, convert it into liquid diesel, and you've turned low-grade coal you'd otherwise discard in slag heaps into a $2-a-gallon at the pump high-test. Pure alchemy.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's making early investors rich. Call it the Spindletop Effect. The U.S. company that's leading the K-fuel revolution is up 73% in the last three years.&nbsp; But at no point in the past 3 years would I have recommended it except as a speculation. Now, however, things are different. Oil is at $60 for starters. And Sasol, the South African blue chip, has created a $20 billion business out of converting low-grade coal to diesel.&nbsp; The fact that Sasol is also up 148% in three years tells you: the clean coal solution is for real. </font></p>

					<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Between 1971 and 1974, the price of oil went from $1.65 a barrel to $9.76--a 592% increase.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was a period that looks in retrospect like the first rumblings of today's roaring World War III. Oil fields were being nationalized, America was loathed by the Havenots and global tribalism was rampant.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What happened to gold? Gold prices also soared. The ounce of gold worth $43.63 in 1971 was worth $186.50 four years later--a 427% increase. </font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On 9/11, the price of oil was $26 and gold was $271. Since then, oil prices are up 130% and gold is up 153%.</font></p>

					<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'd like to compare oil and gold prices because this approach sidesteps the emotional issues that can cloud our thinking about gold. We can put the case for gold simply in terms of oil. If you believe oil prices are headed back towards $26 a barrel, whatever you do, don't buy gold.</font></p>

							Remarkably safe, fast PROFITS.<br>
							How did we do?&quot;</font></h2>
					<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I began this <i>Intelligence Report</i> by making the case for commodities in your portfolio.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I said that it is now timely and right for conservative investors to make room in their portfolios for natural resource stocks, because many of them are safer than the domestic stock market. </font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I hope I proved it to you that commodity-oriented stocks can be safe, especially if you avoid speculative oil patch plays and fuel cell gimmicks.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">China's growth (Japan's too), the breaking of the old supply-demand see-saw, and the dangerous new era of vengeful wars between those who have resources and those who don't--all fuel this massive bull market.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And will do for the next fifteen, possibly 20 years.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Young's <em>Intelligence Report</em> subscribers have been there from the very start. In the past three years, as I have shown you, the profits in our favorite resource plays have been huge:</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By grasping the significance of this shift, and by following the explicit instructions published regularly in Young's <i>Intelligence Report</i>, you could have been sitting on a tidy pile of profits in the past three years.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You could have--but because you didn't, it now becomes imperative that you act now. As I said, we are but a few years into a 15-20 year bull market. The shortest bull market in commodities lasted 15 years, the longest 23 years. The periodic slumps will get very severe in the second half of this run, but right now the bull market in the resources I have talked about today is accelerating.</font></p>

					<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...The Young Million Dollar Promise</font></h3>
					<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Overall:</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I will provide the blanket of financial security you go to sleep under, the blanket of safety that you wake up under.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I will provide the consistency you need--and the growth you crave.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I will provide the simplicity that endures. </font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It took me all my life,&quot; jazz trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie once said, &quot;to learn what notes not to play.&quot;</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I will provide you with the truth which you will sometimes find unpalatable and almost never find elsewhere.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I will provide direct explanations that don't insult your intelligence or experience, in a form that gets to the point, so you don't waste time (and neither do I.)</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Specifically</font></p>
					<p><font color="#003366" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>1. You will win--by never losing.</strong></font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My strategy is designed to capture big profits without endangering principal. You will invest in locked-in trends that cannot be reversed, derailed, impeded or thrown off course by any conceivable external force. Period. This approach has created considerable wealth for the last 32 years and has never once suffered a meaningful loss.</font></p>
					<p><font color="#003366" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>2. You will hit 'em--where they ain't.</strong> </font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You will not zig and you will not zag. But you will not mind investing decisively in stocks that are &quot;overlooked&quot;--or even obscure. Trendy (meaning already overpriced, over-hyped and ripe for a fall) will cease to be of interest to you. When a company trades for half what it's worth and the business dominates a locked-in trend, it's safe and easy to pluck a 42% gain as we did with Caterpillar last year. And you will do this several times a year from now on.</font></p>
					<p><font color="#003366" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>3. You will have a STRATEGY.</strong> </font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No more meatloaf portfolios! Your portfolio will be degreased...efficient...simple. You will know your stocks cold, and you'll track them once a month. Every year, from now on you will grow wealthier. You will laugh at manias, bubbles, busts and calamities. You will never be vulnerable and you'll never feel vulnerable. Ever again.</font></p>

Independent advice--advice that really has not been &quot;bought-and-paid for&quot; somewhere, somehow--is rare. Imagine, then, the advantage of having access to advice that you can trust. Access to 32 years of experience. Access to a successful professional investor and advisor who only works for you! That's exactly what you'll have, from this moment on.</font></p>
					<p><font color="#003366" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>5. You will invest in SAFE-AND-CHEAP STOCKS.</strong> </font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Stocks with a thick coat of protective armor. Companies that are stripped of all cuteness. Companies that keep things radically simple. You've had a sampling of them here, so you already understand their potential. Enough said.</font></p>
					<p><font color="#003366" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>6. Day and night your money will make money--RELENTLESSLY. </strong></font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wherever I go, even in the deepest wilderness or highest mountain peak, I carry a small dog-eared sheet of paper. In quiet moments, I unfold it and read with awe...a compounding table. Compound interest is, as Einstein said, mankind's greatest invention. Harness the power and begin to multiply your wealth and every tick of the clock. Do this and live richer now. Do this and build wealth that exceeds your ability to spend it!</font></p>
					<p><font color="#003366" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>7. In three years, you'll be far richer than you could have imagined.</strong> </font></p>
