 IPA     IPA   is a southern state of the United States of America. Arkansas
shares a border with six states, with its eastern border largely defined by the
Mississippi River. Its diverse geography ranges from the mountainous regions of
the Ozarks and the Ouachita Mountains to the eastern lowlands along the
Mississippi River. The capital and most populous city is Little Rock.

Geography

See  [[List of Arkansas counties]], [[List of cities in Arkansas]], [[List of
Arkansas townships]], [[List of Arkansas native plants]].

Arkansas is the first state in the U.S. where diamonds were found naturally
 near Murfreesboro, Arkansas .

The eastern border of most of Arkansas is the Mississippi River, except in Clay
and Greene counties where the St. Francis River forms the western boundary of
the Missouri Bootheel. Arkansas shares its southern border with Louisiana, its
northern border with Missouri, its eastern border with Tennessee and
Mississippi, and its western border with Texas and Oklahoma.

Arkansas is a land of mountains and valleys, thick forests and fertile plains.
Northwest Arkansas is part of the Ozark Plateau including the Boston Mountains,
to the south are the Ouachita Mountains and these regions are divided by the
Arkansas River  the southern and eastern parts of Arkansas are called the
Lowlands.

The so called Lowlands are better known as the Delta and the Grand Prairie. The
land along the Mississippi River is referred to as the  Delta  of Arkansas. It
gets this name from the formation of its rich alluvial soils formed from the
flooding of the mighty Mississippi. The Grand Prairie is slightly away from the
Mississippi River in the southeast portion of the state and consists of a more
undulating landscape. Both are fertile agricultural areas and home to much of
the crop agriculture in the state.

The Delta region is bisected by an unusual geological formation known as
Crowley s Ridge. A narrow band of rolling hills, Crowley s Ridge rises from 250
to 500 feet above the surrounding alluvial plain.

, one of many attractions that give the state s nickname The Natural State.]]
Arkansas is home to many caves, such as Blanchard Springs Caverns.

Arkansas is home to many areas protected by the National Park System. These
include   Arkansas Post National Memorial at Gillett  Buffalo National River
 Fort Smith National Historic Site  Hot Springs National Park  Little Rock
Central High School National Historic Site  Pea Ridge National Military Park

The Trail of Tears National Historic Trail also runs through Arkansas.

Climate Arkansas generally has a humid subtropical climate, which borders on
humid continental in some northern highland areas. While not bordering the Gulf
of Mexico, Arkansas is still close enough to this warm, large body of water for
it to be the main weather influence in the state. Generally, Arkansas has very
hot, humid summers and mild, slightly drier winters. In Little Rock, the daily
high temperatures average around 90  F  32  C  in the summer and close to 50  F
 10  C  in winter. Annual precipitation throughout the state averages between 40
and 50 inches  1,000 to 1,250 mm   getting gradually wetter as you go from west
to east. Snowfall is not uncommon, but certainly not excessive in most years as
the average snowfall is around 5 inches  13 cm . ref name  avgsnf.txt

Despite its subtropical climate, Arkansas is known for occasional extreme
weather. Betw</STYLE>
