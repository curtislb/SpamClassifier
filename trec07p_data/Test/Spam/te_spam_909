The  Red tailed Hawk   Buteo jamaicensis  is a large bird of prey. It breeds
almost throughout North America from western Alaska and northern Canada to as
far South as Panama and the West Indies.

This is one of three species colloquially known in the United States as the
 chickenhawk. 

Description

Males can weigh from 690 to 1300 grams  1.5 to 2.9 pounds  and measure 45   56
cm  18 to 22 in . Females can weigh between 900 and 2000 grams  2 and 4.4
pounds  and measure 50   65 cm  20 to 26 in  in length. The wingspan is from 110
to 145 cm  43 to 57 in . This blocky bird is relatively heavy for it s length.
Birds of this species can usually be distinguished from other [[Buteo]]s by a
dark mark along the leading edge of the underwing, between the body and the
wrist  the patagium . Most, but not all color variations have a dark brown band
across the belly. The light adult s breast is pale while the light juvenile s
breast is a whitish color. Light morphs have a white V ranging from its back to
its wings. In most, the adults  tails are rusty red above, and juveniles have
narrow brown and pale bands. The main western North American population has
bands on the adults  rusty tails as well and has varied plumage, organized into
three main color types or morphs.

Immature birds, or birds that are only a few years old, can also readily be
identified by having yellowish irises. As the bird attains full maturity over
the course of 3   4 years, the iris slowly darkens into a reddish brown hue.

  Light morph birds are mainly brown on the upperparts and very pale brown or
  buff on the underparts and underwings  they show a belly band.
  Rufous morph birds are darker and redder, with reddish brown rather than white
  on the underparts. The belly band may be barely visible.
  Dark morph birds are very dark brown on both upperparts and underparts  they
  have lighter parts on the underwings.

Almost all of the main eastern North American population are light morph, with
whiter underparts and paler markings than western birds, and with solid rust red
tails as adults.

Other variations are 
   Harlan s Hawk  usually has blackish plumage contrasting with white undersides
  of the flight feathers  the tail may be reddish or grey and is longitudinally
  streaked rather than barred. This is the only type of Red tail in which the
  dark wing marking is not distinct. It breeds in Alaska and northwestern Canada
  and winters from Nebraska and Iowa to Texas and northern Louisiana. It is
  sometimes considered a separate species, Buteo harlani, or subspecies, B.
  jamaicensis harlani.
   Krider s Hawk  is paler than other red tails, especially on the head  the
  tail may be pinkish or white. It is mainly found in the central prairies of
  the United States.

Resident breeding birds in Central America have cinnamon underparts which
enables them to be easily distinguished from the paler breasted wintering
migrants  Stiles   Skutch .

Habitat and reproduction

The breeding habitat is open country with high perches, and any area within this
definition may be utilized. They build a stick nest in a large tree, in a
cactus, or on a cliff ledge 35 m  115 ft  or higher above ground  they may also
nest on man made structures. A lot of the time these hawks build their nests
near clear, open feeding areas which will eliminate the need to search for prey.

The shells of these birds  eggs are colored a dull or bluish white with a
granulated or smooth surface, never glossy. There may be some splotches of
various shades of brown. The eggs are usually about 60 x 47 mm  2.4 x 1.9 in .
Incubation is by the female is 28 to 35 days, during which time she is fed by
her mate. The female then broods the chicks until the youngest is about 30 to 35
days. The young are able to fly at about 45 days of age, but are often dependant
on the parents for a further 7 to 8 weeks.

Behavior


Red tailed Hawks generally prefer to wait on a certain perch and swoop down on
prey  though they will also patrol open areas in flight. They mainly eat small
mammals, birds and reptiles. Their favorite prey varies with regional and
seasonal availability but usually includes cottontails, rodents, pheasants and
quail. Other prey includes waterfowl, bats, shrews, snakes, lizards,
crustaceans, insects, and, when near the water s edge, carp and catfish. Those
that live in cities may prefer pigeons and starlings, both of which are
plentiful in many urban areas. Prey taken can range in size from a beetle to a
jackrabbit heavier than any Red tail. The Great Horned Owl occupies a similar
ecological niche nocturnally, taking most of the same prey. Competition may
occur between Red tails and Great Horned Owls during twilight hours, but attacks
on Red tailed Hawks and their nest by the owls that are recorded during the
night are likely purely predatory.

In flight, these hawks soar with wings in a slight dihedral, flapping as little
as possible, for this will conserve their needed energy. They sometimes hover on
beating wings and sometimes  kite , or remain stationary above the ground by
soaring into the wind. When soaring or flapping their wings, they typically
travel from 30 km h to 65 km h, but when diving may reach speeds as high as 195
km h.

In most of the United States, Red tailed Hawks are permanent residents, but
