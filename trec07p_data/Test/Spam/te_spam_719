Dear Sir,
 
First, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction; this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and TOP SECRET.  Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that

I came to know of you in my private search for a reliable and reputable person to handle this confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring maximum confidence.

THE PROPOSITION:

A foreigner, late Engineer David  McCreery, an Oil Merchant/contractor with  Government of Ghana, until his death three years ago in a ghastly air crash, banked with us here at Trust Bank Ltd,Head office,Accra-Ghana, and had a closing balance of USD$7.3M (SEVEN MILLION, THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND U.S DOLLARS ONLY) which the bank now unquestionably expects it to be claimed by any available foreign next – of- kin of the late beneficiary or alternatively be donated to a discredited trust fund for arms and ammunition at a military war college here in Ghana. Fervent valuable efforts are being made by the Trust Bank  Ltd to get in touch with any of the  late Engineer David  McCreery, S family or relatives but proved to avail.

It is because of the perceived possibility of not being able to locate any of late David  McCreery next – of kin (he had no known wife and children) that the management under the influence of our Chairman and member of the board of directors, retired Major General KOFFI NKWAMEN, that an arrangement be made for the funds to be declared “UNCLAIMABLE “ and subsequently be donated to the Trust Fund for Arms and
Ammunition to further enhances the course of war in Africa and the world in general. In order to avert this negative development, some of my trusted colleagues and I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next - of- kin to late David  McCreery so that the funds USD$7.3m would be released and paid into your bank account as the beneficiary next – of – kin. 

All documents and proves to enable you get this fund will be carefully worked out and more so we are assuring you of a 100% risk free involvement. ]
