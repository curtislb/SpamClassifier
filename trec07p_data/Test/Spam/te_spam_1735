This system wasn't flawless either. The government of the people couldn't do good to the people itself. There might have been a change of system, but for us, the common men, it only brought "another government". Too much freedom didn't bring us too much prosperity. It became more and more difficult to make both ends meet. I lost my job and I would wander like a dog in search of work. Mia got sick because of malnutrition. I would come home late in the night and would get out early in the morning. We were running our lives somehow. There wasn't much of a conversation between Mia and I. Perhaps there wasn't anything left to talk about.
