www.du.edu]    The  University of Denver    DU   is an independent,
coeducational, four year university in Denver, Colorado. DU currently enrolls
approximately 10,400 students, about equally divided between graduate and
undergraduate programs. The 125 acre main campus is a designated arboretum and
is located primarily in the University Neighborhood      DU is NOT in University
Park. Please see the reference and the talk page      ref 
[http   www.denvergov.org denvermaps downloads maps citywide Neighborhoods.pdf

August 25, 2006  ref , about seven miles south of downtown Denver.

Background and rankings The University was founded in 1864 as Colorado Seminary
by John Evans, the former Territorial Governor of Colorado, who had been
appointed by US President Abraham Lincoln. Evans, who also founded Northwestern
University prior to founding DU, is the source of the town in Illinois named
 Evanston   the site of the Northwestern campus  as well as Mount Evans, a
14,000+ foot mountain visible from the DU campus. The reverse initials  DU  are
used as the University s shorthand moniker  rather than the more intuitive  UD  
as part of a midwestern tradition of initial reversal, similar to the University
of Colorado s  CU , the University of Oklahoma s  OU  and the University of
Kansas   KU. 

In 2005, Denver selected former provost Robert Coombe as its new Chancellor.

DU is one of the top private universities in the Western United States and
ranked in the top 100 nationally according to [[U.S. News and World Report]].
The nationally ranked Daniels College of Business is the primary undergraduate
and graduate drawing card, but there are also considerable graduate level
strengths in law, professional psychology, international studies, and social
work.

Campus

The heart of the campus has a number of historic buildings. The longest standing
building is University Hall, which has served DU since 1890. Evans Chapel, an
1870s vintage small church which was once located in downtown Denver, was
relocated to the DU campus in the 1960s, and Buchtel Tower  1913 , which is all
that remains of the former Buchtel Chapel, which burned in 1983. The
administrative offices are located in the Mary Reed Building, a former library
built in 1932 in the collegiate gothic style.

Under the leadership of former Chancellor Daniel Ritchie  now Chairman of the
Denver Center for Performing Arts , about $500 million in capital improvements
have taken place in the last decade and the learning inside these new buildings
has improved in the same period, as admissions selectivity and rankings have
improved dramatically.

In autumn 2003, DU opened a new 63.5 million USD facility for its College of
Law, what was later named the  Sturm College of Law.  The building includes a
three story library with personal computers accessible to students.

The Daniels College of Business was completed in September 1999 at the cost of
$25 million dollars. The business school has been nationally recognized by such
prestigious organizations such as Forbes magazine, Business Week, and the Wall
Street Journal where it is ranked 4th in the nation for producing students with
high ethical standards.

Additionally, the University also recently opened the acclaimed $75 million
Newman Center for the Performing Arts, which houses the acclaimed Lamont School
of Music. The center includes a 1,000 seat, four level opera house with the
finest acoustics in the region, a 250 seat recital hall with the largest  3,000
pipes  natural organ in the region, and a 300 seat flexible theatre space. The
Newman Center serves as home to many professional performing arts groups as well
as University performing </STYLE>
