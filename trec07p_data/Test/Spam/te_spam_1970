 Sri Lanka , officially the  Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka 
 Sinhalese  ,   known as  Ceylon  before 1972  is an island nation in South
Asia, located about 31 kilometers  18   mi  off the southern coast of India.
Originally known as Heladiva, it is home to more than twenty million people.

Sri Lanka is a strategic naval link between West Asia and South East Asia and
has been a centre of Buddhist religion and culture from ancient times. Today,
Sri Lanka is a multi religious and multi ethnic nation, with a fifth of the
population following faiths other than Buddhism   notably Hinduism, Christianity
and Islam. The Sinhalese community forms the majority of the population  around
74  , with Tamils, who are mostly concentrated in the north and east of the
island, forming the largest ethnic minority. Other communities include the
Muslim Moors and Malays as well as Burghers.

Famous for the production and export of tea, coffee, rubber and coconuts, Sri
Lanka boasts a progressive and modern industrial economy. The natural beauty of
Sri Lanka s tropical forests, beaches and landscape, as well as its rich
cultural heritage make it a world famous tourist destination.

After over two thousand years of rule by local kingdoms, parts of Sri Lanka were
colonized by Portugal and the Netherlands beginning in the 16th century, before
the control of the entire country was ceded to the British Empire in 1815.
During World War II Sri Lanka served as an important base for Allied forces in
the fight against the Japanese Empire. A nationalist political movement arose in
the country in the early 20th century, with the aim of obtaining political
independence, which was eventually granted by the British after peaceful
negotiations in 1948. Since then Sri Lanka has enjoyed a stable democracy and
continuous economic progress, despite the ongoing conflict between the Sri
Lankan government and a separatist militant group known as the LTTE in the
northeastern parts of the country.

Name

In ancient times, Sri Lanka was known by a variety of names  ancient Greek
geographers called it Taprobane and Arabs referred to it as Serendib. Ceil  o
was the name given to Sri Lanka by the Portuguese when they arrived on the
island in 1505, which was transliterated into English as Ceylon. In 1972, the
official name of the country was changed to  Free, Sovereign and Independent
Republic of Sri Lanka   in Sinhala   r   la   k  ,   whereas the island itself
is referred to as                 la   k  va, , in Tamil                   
ila   kai,  . In 1978 it was changed to  Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri
Lanka .

The current name is derived from Sanskrit   r  ,  resplendent , and la   k  
which is the name of the island as described in the Mahabharata and the
Ramayana.

History

Paleolithic human settlements have been discovered at excavations in several
cave sites in the Western Plains region and the South western face of the
Central Hills region. Anthropologists believe that some discovered burial rites
and certain decorative artifacts exhibit similarities between the first
inhabitants of the island and the early inhabitants of southern India. Recent
bioanthropological studies have however dismissed these links, and have placed
the origin of the people to the northern parts of India. One of the first
written references to the island is found in the Indian epic Ramayana, which
described the emperor Ravana as monarch of the powerful kingdom of [[Lanka]].
The main written accounts of the country s history are the Buddhist chronicles
of Mahavansa and Dipavamsa.

 fresco.]] The earliest known inhabitants of the island now known as Sri Lanka
 were probably the ancestors of the Wanniyala Aetto people, also known as
 Veddahs and numbering roughly 3,000. Linguistic analysis has found a
 correlation of the Sinhalese language with the languages of the Sindh and
 Gujarat, although most histori</STYLE>
