 Herbert Henry Asquith, 1st Earl of Oxford and Asquith , KG, PC  12 September
1852  ndash  15 February 1928  served as the Liberal Prime Minister of the
United Kingdom from 1908 to 1916. During his lifetime he was known as  H. H.
Asquith  before his accession to the peerage and as  Lord Oxford  afterwards.

Biography He was born in Morley, West Yorkshire to Joseph Dixon Asquith
 February 10, 1825 March 29, 1860  and his wife Emily Willans  May 4, 1828 
December 12, 1888 . The Asquiths were a middle class family and members of the
Congregational church. Joseph was a wool merchant and came to own his own wool
mill.

Herbert was seven years old when his father died. Emily and her children moved
to the house of her father William Willans, a wool stapler of Huddersfield.
Herbert received schooling there and was later sent to a Moravian boarding
school at Fulneck, near Leeds.

In 1863, Herbert was sent to live with an uncle in London, where he entered the
City of London School. He was educated there until 1870 and was mentored there
by its headmaster Edwin Abbott Abbott.

In 1870, Asquith won a classical scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford. In
1874, Asquith was awarded the Craven scholarship and became president of the
Oxford Union. He graduated that year and soon was elected a fellow at Balliol.
Meanwhile he entered Lincoln s Inn as a student barrister and for a year served
a pupillage under Charles Bowen.

He was called to the bar in 1876 and became prosperous in the early 1880s from
practising law.

Marriage He married Helen Kelsall Melland, daughter of a Manchester doctor, in
1877 and they had four sons and one daughter before she died from typhoid fever
in 1891. These children were Raymond, Herbert  1881 1947 , Arthur Melland
Asquith  1883   1939 , Violet  1887 1969 , and Cyril. Of these children, Violet
and Cyril became Life Peers in their own right  Cyril becoming a Law Lord.

In 1894, he married Margot Tennant, a daughter of Sir Charles Tennant, 1st Bt.
With his second wife Margot, he had two children, Elizabeth Charlotte Lucy
 later Princess Antoine Bibesco   1897 1945  and the film director Anthony  1902 
1968 .

All his children, except Anthony, married and left issue. His most well known
descendant today is the actress Helena Bonham Carter, a granddaughter of Violet.

Name In his younger days he was called Herbert within the family, but his second
wife called him Henry. However, in public he was invariably referred to only as
 H. H. Asquith .  There have been few major national figures whose Christian
names were less well known to the public,  writes his biographer, Roy Jenkins.

When raised to the peerage in 1925, he proposed to take the title  Earl of
Oxford  for the city near which he lived and the university he had attended.
Objections were raised, especially by descendants of Earls of Oxford of previous
creations  titles by then extinct , and his title was given in the form  Earl of
Oxford and Asquith . In practice, however, he was known as  Lord Oxford .

During Asquith s period as deputy to Sir Henry Campbell Bannerman,  C. B.  was
known to request his presence in parliamentary debate by saying,  Send for the
sledge hammer,  referring to Asquith s reliable command of facts and his ability
to dominate verbal exchange.

Early career  1886 1908  Elected to Parliament in 1886 as the Liberal
representative for East Fife, in Scotland, he achieved his first significant
post in 1892 when he became Home Secretary under Gladstone  and later under
Rosebery . The Liberals went out of power for ten years from 1895, and he turned
down an offer to lead the party in 1898.

The Liberal Party won a landslide victory in the 1906 general election, and
