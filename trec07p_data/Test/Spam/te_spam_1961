 Miniature Horses  are found all over the world and come in various colors and
coat patterns. The designation of miniature horse is determined by the height of
the animal, which, depending on the particular registry involved, is usually
less than 34 38 inches  82 91 cm  as measured at the withers. ref
name  AMHA  [http   www.amha.org American Miniature Horse Association]  ref  ref
name  AMHR  [http   www.shetlandminiature.com American Miniature Horse
Registry]  ref 

Miniature horses are friendly and interact well with people, particularly
children. For this reason they are often kept as family pets. They are also
trained as service animals, akin to guide dogs or assistance dogs for people
with disabilities. ref [http   www.guidehorse.org Guide Horse Foundation]  ref 
However, while miniature horses can be trained to work indoors, they are still
real horses and are healthier when allowed to live outdoors  with proper shelter
and room to run  when not working with
humans. ref [http   www.guidehorse.org horses_house.htm  Horses in your house, 
web site, accessed January 17, 2007]  ref 

They are generally quite hardy, often living longer on average than some full 
sized horse breeds  the average life span of miniature horses is from 25 to 35
years. ref name  facts  [http   www.guidehorse.org faq_horses.htm  Miniature
Horse Facts ]  ref 

Organizations and registration requirements There are two registries in the
United States for Miniature Horses, the American Miniature Horse Association
 AMHA  and the American Miniature Horse Registry  AMHR .

The AMHA was founded in 1978 and was dedicated to establishing the Miniature
horse as a distinct breed of horse. ref name  history mini  [http   www.mini 
horse.org mini_horse_history.html  The History of Miniature Horses and Ponies. 
Web site, accessed January 17, 2007]  ref  ref name  AMHA    The AMHR is a
division of the American Shetland pony Club and was established as a separate
registry in 1972. ref name  shetland
pony  [http   www.horseshoes.com magazine shetland amstpncl.htm  Unique   
Interesting    A Class All of lts Own,  The Journal of The American Shetland
Pony Club Accessed January 17, 2007]  ref  In the AMHA, Miniatures cannot exceed
34 inches at the withers  which the AMHA defines as located at the last hair of
the mane . There are two divisions in AMHR   the  A  division for horses 34
inches  82 cm  and under, and the  B  division for horses 34 to 38 inches  82  
91 cm . ref name  AMHR   

Worldwide, there are dozens of miniature horse registries. Some organizations
emphasize breeding of miniatures with horse characteristics, others encourage
minis to retain pony
characteristics. ref [http   www.guidehorse.org registry.htm  The Top 20
Miniature Horse Registries,  web site, accessed January 17, 2007]  ref 

The AMHA standard suggests that if a person were to see a photograph of a
miniature horse, without any size reference, it would be identical in
characteristics, conformation, and proportion to a full sized horse. ref
name  AMHA   

According to the AMHR, a  Miniature should be a small, sound, well balanced
horse and should give the impression of strength, agility and alertness. A
Miniature should be eager and friendly but not skittish in disposition.  ref
name  shetland pony   

Showing miniature horses There are many horse show opportunities offered by both
American registries. Classes include  Halter  horse conformation , in hand
hunter and jumper, driving, liberty, costume, and obstacle or  trail  classes.
There are Local, Regional, National, and World competitions.

History

Miniature horses were developed from multiple sources. Many different pony
breeds were bred for small size, including the Shetland pony and the Dartmoor
pony. There may also have been an infusion of bloodlines from certain breeds of
full sized horses. ref [http   www.mini horse.org mini_horse_breeds.html  Mini
Horse Breeds  Accessed January 17, 2007]  ref 

In the 17th century, miniature horses were bred as pets for Europe s Hapsburg
nobility. Records from the court of the French King Louis XIV, circa 1650, note
the presence of tiny horses among the exotic creatures in the king s zoo.
Paintings and articles featured the miniature horse by 1765. Lady Estella Hope
and her sisters carried on the original English lines into the mid nineteen
hundreds. However, not all early miniatures were pampered pets of kings and
queens. Some were used to work in the English Midlands, Wales and Northern
European coal mines as pit ponies.

In the United States, the miniature horse breed was refined during the 20th
century. Miniature horses in the USA added additional lines from sources that
included the Hackney Pony and the Pony of the Americas.

The Falabella miniature horse was originally developed in Argentina in 1868 by
Patrick Newell. When Newell died, the herd and breeding methods were passed to
Newell s son in law, Juan Falabella. Juan added additional bloodlines including
the Welsh Pony, Shetland pony, and small Thoroughbreds. With considerable
inbreeding he was able to gain consistently small size within the herd.

South Africa s Miniature Horses were developed in that nation and are known as
the South African Miniature Horses, a recognized breed in its own right. Mr.
Wynand de Wet of Lindley, South Africa, started in 1945 with two Shetland mares
and a stallion. Through strict selection, their offspring became smaller and in
1991 Mr. de Wet bred a mare that was only 66cm
tall. ref [http   minihorseworld.com resources library history southafrica.asp

Controversies Dwarfism is a concern within the miniature horse world. Dwarf
horses, while often setting world records for size, are not generally considered
to have desirable traits, and therefore most minis affected by dwarfism are not
accepted by many miniature horse regist</STYLE>
