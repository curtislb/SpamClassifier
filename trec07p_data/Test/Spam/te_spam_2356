    Abraham Lincoln   February 12, 1809     April 15, 1865  was President of the
United States from March 4, 1861 to April 15, 1865. As an outspoken opponent of
the expansion of slavery and a political leader in the western states, he won
the Republican Party nomination in 1860 and was elected president later that
year.

Lincoln helped preserve the United States by leading the defeat of the
secessionist Confederacy in the American Civil War. He introduced measures that
resulted in the abolition of slavery, issuing his Emancipation Proclamation in
1863 and promoting the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution
in 1865.

Lincoln s leadership qualities were evident in his close supervision of the
victorious war effort, especially his successful selection of Ulysses S. Grant
and other top generals. Historians conclude he brilliantly handled the factions
of the Republican Party by bringing the leaders into his cabinet and forcing
them to cooperate. In crisis management, he defused a war scare with the United
Kingdom  1861 , he outmaneuvered the Confederacy and took control of the border
slave states in 1861 62, and he managed his own landslide reelection in the 1864
presidential election.

Antiwar Copperheads criticized him for refusing to compromise on slavery. On the
other hand, Radical Republicans, a strongly Abolitionist faction of the
Republican Party, criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery.
Lincoln rallied public opinion through the powerful rhetoric of his messages and
speeches  his Gettysburg Address is remembered as the prime example. At the
close of the war, Lincoln took a moderate view of Reconstruction, seeking to
speedily re unite the nation through a policy of generous reconciliation.

Lincoln s assassination in 1865 made him a martyr for the ideal of national
unity.

Scholars rank Lincoln among the top three U.S. Presidents, with the average of
those surveys placing him at number one. He is noted for his lasting influence
on U.S. politics, including redefining republican values. ref  As Diggins
explains,  Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a
profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself.  John
Patrick Diggins, The Lost Soul of American Politics  Virtue, Self interest, and
the Foundations of Liberalism  1986  p. 307. Foner  1970  p. 215 noted that,
 Lincoln stressed the moral basis of Republicanism.  Jaffa  2000  p. 399,
stresses Lincoln s emphasis on the Declaration of Independence as what Lincoln
called the  sheet anchor  of republicanism. See also McPherson  1992  pp.61 
64.  ref 

Lincoln 1809 to 1854 Early life  Main Article  [[Lincoln s Early Life and
Career]]

Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, to Thomas Lincoln and Nancy
Hanks, two uneducated farmers. He was born in a one room log cabin on the 348 
acre  1.4 km    Sinking Spring Farm, in Nolin Creek, three miles  5 km  south of
Hodgenville, in southeast Hardin County, Kentucky  now part of LaRue County , an
area which at that time was considered the  frontier.  Lincoln was named after
his grandfather, who was killed in 1786 in an American Indian raid. ref Donald
 1995  p 21  ref  He had no middle name. Lincoln had one elder sister, Sarah
Lincoln, who was born in 1807. He also had a younger brother, Thomas Jr, who
died in infancy.

]] Thomas Lincoln was a respected and relatively affluent citizen of the
Kentucky back country for a period of time. He had purchased the Sinking Spring
Farm in December 1808 for $200 cash and assumption of a debt. ref  The farm site
is now preserved as part of Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic
Site.  ref  Thomas lost all his property in court cases, however, and the family
had to make a new start in Indiana. His parents belonged to a Baptist church
that had pulled away from a larger church because they refused to support
slavery. From a very young age, Lincoln was exposed to anti slavery sentiment.
However, he never joined his parents  church, or any other, and as a youth he
ridiculed religion. ref Life of Abraham Lincoln, Colonel Ward H. Lamon, 1872  
portions reprinted in http   www.positiveatheism.org hist steinlinc.htm  ref  It
is often debated whether Abraham Lincoln had Marfan syndrome, an autosomal
dominant disorder of the connective tissue characterized by long limbs and great
stature, among other things. ref http   www.mayoclinic.com health marfan 
syndrome DS00540  ref 

In 1816, when Lincoln was seven years old, his family moved to Perry County  now
in Spencer County , Indiana. He later noted that this move was  partly on
account of slavery,  and partly because of economic difficulties in Kentucky. In
1818, Lincoln s mother died of  milk sickness  at age thirty four, when Abe was
nine. Soon afterwards, Lincoln s father remarried to Sarah Bush Johnston. Sarah
Lincoln raised young Lincoln like one of her own children. Years later she
compared Lincoln to her own son, saying  Both were good boys, but I must say    
both now being dead that Abe was the best boy I ever saw or ever expect to see. 
Lincoln was affectionate toward his step mother, whom he would for the rest of
his life call  Mother,  but d</STYLE>
