Since my childhood I was taught that it is very bad to take something which
doesn't belong to you.  When I became 18 I broke friendship with my group
mate, because I found out that she was having an affair with a man, who is
30 and left his wife with two kids!
Now I hope that I've finally met man of my dreams, you, and even if you are
married or already have a girlfriend, I am ready to take you away and leave
only for me, for my love and warmth!  I changed my opinion and I am willing
to start a relationship with you at http://inetfeelings.com/fantasy. 
Find me there and tell me a bit about your dreams.


Looking forward to get a letter from you
Nastyunya
