        Dear Reader,

        As companies target the highly desirable young,
        professional, and upscale demographic groups in
        burgeoning China, picking the right partners is
        essential.  Just as Focus Media Holding, Ltd.
        (NasdaqGM:FMCN) has chosen the right partners and
        vendors on their path to success in China, emergent
        out-of-home advertiser i-level Media Group (OTC
        BB:ILVL) has now picked a content partner that the
        company believes will enhance their ability to leverage
        what is already China's largest in-taxi digital media
        and advertising network.

        Yesterday's announcement that i-level has entered into
        a long-term content sourcing agreement with iVivi.cn,
        marries the broad media footprint of i-level with
        iVivi.cn's unique fashion and lifestyle programming
        targeted to China's up-and-coming generation of
        style-conscious young women.

           The affluent and the upper middle class get around
                            Shanghai in taxis

        These individuals are eager to become integrated in the
        global economy and to enjoy the living standards of
        developed nations. This in turn has been a catalyst for

        goods and higher-end products and services.
        Consequently, producers of such goods and services are
        clamoring for effective media to reach this emerging
        middle class and tap into its fast-growing buying
        power. i-level meets this need by providing an
        innovative and exciting medium that effectively targets
        these individuals.

        i-level is well positioned for rapid expansion with
        870,000 taxis in major cities across China – and
        accessing a direct channel to China’s most affluent,
        mobile audience with higher than average disposable
        incomes. Management at i-level projects 25-fold revenue
        growth to 2009 through out-of-home digital advertising

        networks in existence and also licenses its technology
        and expertise to third parties seeking mobile digital
        media solutions. i-level's proprietary technological
        platform, consisting of high-quality LCD displays
        mounted inside the passenger compartments of taxis,
        provides a consistent, reliable and high-impact channel
        for reaching consumers on the go. Through exclusive

        intimate setting.

        The China Taxicab and Livery Association was formed
        with the mission to create a voice for taxi operators
        across China in order to set industry standards,
        promote new technologies, increase safety measures for
        taxi operation and as well as push other general
        improvements for the taxi riding experience. The
        Association counts over 600 active members across the
        country representing over 900,000 taxis from all 30 of
        China's provinces. The association works closely with
        government bodies regulating all aspects of taxi
        operations to lobby regulators on both national and
        provincial levels to promote their goals.

<p>Dear Reader,
<p>As companies target the highly desirable young, professional, and upscale
demographic groups in burgeoning China, picking the right partners is essential.&nbsp;
Just as <b>Focus Media Holding, Ltd. (NasdaqGM:FMCN)</b> has chosen the
right partners and vendors on their path to success in China, emergent
out-of-home advertiser <b>i-level Media Group (OTC BB:ILVL)</b> has now
picked a content partner that the company believes will enhance their ability
to leverage what is already China's largest in-taxi digital media and advertising
network.
<p>Yesterday's announcement that i-level has entered into a long-term content
sourcing agreement with iVivi.cn, marries the broad media footprint of
i-level with iVivi.cn's unique fashion and lifestyle programming targeted
to China's up-and-coming generation of style-conscious young women.
