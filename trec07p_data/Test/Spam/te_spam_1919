History

The town of Hopatcong has a rich history given its relationship with New York
City. It borders Lake Hopatcong, a partially man made lake that is now a source
of much recreation and desirable real estate, and is the biggest lake in New
Jersey. The town, just 40 miles west of New York City, began as a summer get
away for the wealthy in NYC who primarily sought access to the lake. An
amusement park sprung up called  Bertrand s Island  which was accessible via the
lake or by car through Mount Arlington. Much of this however, changed due to the
construction of Interstate 80, a highway that stretches from Teaneck, New Jersey
all the way across the country to San Francisco, California. This new road
ignited a rapid growth in New York s suburbia, enabling people a much easier
commute and thus enabling Hopatcong to become a permanent residential community.
