The  rowans  are plants of the Family Rosaceae, in the Genus [[Sorbus]],
Subgenus  Sorbus . They are native throughout the cool temperate regions of the
northern hemisphere, with the highest species diversity in the mountains of
western China and the Himalaya, where numerous apomictic microspecies occur.

Rowans are mostly small deciduous trees 10 20 m tall, though a few are shrubs.
The leaves are arranged alternately, and are pinnate, with  8  11 35 leaflets.
The flowers are borne in dense corymbs  each flower is creamy white, and 5 10 mm
across with five petals.


The fruit is a small pome 4 8 mm diameter, bright orange or red in most species,
but pink, yellow or white in some Asian species. The fruit are soft and juicy,
which makes them a very good food for birds, particularly waxwings and thrushes,
which then distribute the rowan seeds in their droppings. Rowan is used as a
food plant by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species   see list of Lepidoptera
which feed on Sorbus.

The best known species is the  Rowan Clark  Sorbus aucuparia, a small tree
typically 4 12 m tall growing in a variety of habitats throughout northern
Europe and in mountains in southern Europe and southwest Asia. Its berries are a
favourite food for many birds and are a traditional wild collected food in
Britain and Scandinavia. It is one of the hardiest European trees, occurring to
71   north in Vard   in arctic Norway, and has also become widely naturalized in
northern North America.

North American native rowans include the  American mountain ash  Sorbus
americana and  Showy mountain ash  Sorbus decora in the east and  Sitka mountain
ash  Sorbus sitchensis in the west.

The greatest diversity of form as well as the largest number of species is in
Asia, with very distinctive species such as  Sargent s Rowan  Sorbus sargentiana
with large leaves 20 35 cm long and 15 20 cm broad and very large corymbs with
200 500 flowers, and at the other extreme,  Small leaf Rowan  Sorbus microphylla
with leaves 8 12 cm long and 2.5 3 cm broad. While most are trees, the  Dwarf
Rowan  Sorbus reducta is a low shrub to 50 cm tall. Several of the Asian species
are widely cultivated as ornamental trees.

For other Sorbus species, see whitebeam  Sorbus subgenus [[Whitebeam/Aria]]  and
the genus article [[Sorbus]].

Uses


Rowans are excellent small ornamental trees for parks, gardens and wildlife
areas. Several of the Chinese species, such as White fruited rowan  S.
glabrescens  are popular for their unusual berry colour, and Sargent s rowan  S.
sargentiana  for its exceptionally large clusters of fruit. They are very
attractive to fruit eating birds, which is reflected in the old name  bird
catcher . The wood is dense and used for carving and turning and for tool
handles and walking sticks.

Mythology   folklore The European rowan  S. aucuparia  has a long tradition in
European mythology and folklore</STYLE>
