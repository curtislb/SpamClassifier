<center><=21--Pakistan, speaking on behalf of 77 developing countries plus China, put t=
he onus on industrial countries to increase funding and technology help.

Though the world faces a common goal, countries must meet them according to their =22respe=
ctive capabilities,=22 Pakistani delegate Jamil Ahmad said. That meant deep emissions c=
uts by the developed world and helping less capable countries build their capacity to adap=
t to new weather conditions.

The industrial world must =22move significantly beyond the current institutional and fi=
nancial arrangements,=22 Ahmad said.

It is the first time government climate delegations are meeting since the U.N.-sponsored=
 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued a series of reports this year drawing on=
 the studies of some 2,500 scientists.

The reports warned that climate changes will hit poor countries hardest =E2=80=94 less ra=
in in arid areas like northern Africa and more severe floods in river deltas like Banglades=
h. Millions of poor people will also suffer from greater hunger, thirst and disease, and as=
 much as 30 percent of species will be threatened with extinction.
