www.nebraska.gov /     Nebraska  is a Great Plains state of the United States.
Nebraska gets its name from a Chiwere word meaning  flat water , after the
Platte River that flows through the state. ref   ref  Once considered part of
the Great American Desert, it is now a leading farming state. Nebraskans have
practiced scientific farming to turn the Nebraska prairie into a land of ranches
and farms. Much of the history of the state is the story of the impact of the
Nebraska farmer. Nebraskans are sometimes colloquially referred to as
 Cornhuskers   which is derived from the state nickname .

Geography


Nebraska is bordered by South Dakota to the north  Iowa to the east and Missouri
to the southeast, across the Missouri River  Kansas to the south  Colorado to
the southwest  and Wyoming to the west. Nebraska has 93 counties  it also
occupies the central portion of the Frontier Strip.

Nebraska is composed of two major land regions  the Dissected Till Plains and
the Great Plains. The easternmost portion of the state was scoured by Ice Age
glaciers  the Dissected Till Plains were left behind after the glaciers
retreated. The Dissected Till Plains is a region of gently rolling hills  Omaha
and Lincoln are located within this region.

The Great Plains occupy the majority of western Nebraska. The Great Plains
itself is comprised of several smaller, diverse land regions, including the
Sandhills, the Pine Ridge, the Rainwater Basin, the High Plains and the Wildcat
Hills. Panorama Point, at 5,424 feet  1,653 m , is the highest point in
Nebraska  despite its name and elevation, it is merely a low rise near the
Colorado and Wyoming borders.

A past Nebraska tourism slogan was  Where the West Begins   locations given for
the beginning of the  West  include the Missouri River, the intersection of 13th
and O Streets in Lincoln  where it is marked by a red brick star , the 100th
meridian, and Chimney Rock.
