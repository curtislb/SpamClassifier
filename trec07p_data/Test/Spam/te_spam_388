 Jamaica  is an island nation of the Greater Antilles, 240 kilometers
 150 nbsp mi  in length and as much as 85 kilometers  50 nbsp mi  in width
situated in the Caribbean Sea. It is 635 kilometers  391 nbsp mi  east of the
Central American mainland, 150 kilometers  93 nbsp mi  south of Cuba, and 180
kilometers  112 nbsp mi  west of the island of Hispaniola, on which Haiti and
the Dominican Republic are situated. Its indigenous Arawakan speaking Ta  no
inhabitants named the island Xaymaca, meaning either the  Land of Springs,  or
the  Land of Wood and Water.  Formerly a Spanish possession known as Santiago,
it later became the British West Indies Crown colony of Jamaica. It is the third
most populous anglophone country in the Americas, after Canada and the United
States.

History

The original Arawak or Taino people from South America first settled on the
island between 1000 and 4000 BC. Although some claim they became virtually
extinct following contact with Europeans, others claim that some survived for a
while. There is very little trace of the Arawak culture, and the Jamaican
National Heritage Trust is attempting to locate and document any evidence of the
Arawaks [http   www.jnht.com archaeology barbican_rescue.php].

Jamaica was claimed for Spain after Christopher Columbus first landed there in
1494. Columbus used it as his family s private estate. The British Admiral
William Penn  father of William Penn of Pennsylvania  and General Venables
seized the island in 1655. During its first 200 years of British rule, post
Spanish rule, Jamaica became one of the world s leading sugar exporting nations
and produced over 77,000 tons of sugar annually between 1820 and 1824, which was
achieved through the massive use of imported African slave labour. When this was
not enough the British imported Indian and Chinese indentured servants in the
early 1800s that remained in Jamaica from then until present day.

By the beginning of the 19th century, the United Kingdom s heavy reliance on
slavery resulted in blacks outnumbering whites by a ratio of almost 20 to one,
leading to constant threat of revolt. Following a series of rebellions, slavery
was formally abolished in 1834, with full emancipation from chattel slavery
declared in 1838.

In 1945, Sir Horace Hector Hearne became Chief Justice and Keeper of the Records
in Jamaica and sat in the Supreme Court, Kingston between 1945 and 1950 1951
before going on to become Chief Justice in Kenya.

Jamaica slowly gained increasing independence from the United Kingdom. In 1958,
it became a province in the Federation of the West Indies, a federation among
all of the British West Indies. Jamaica attained full independence by leaving
the federation in 1962.

Strong economic growth averaging about six percent per annum marked its first
ten years of independence under conservative governments led successively by
Prime Ministers Alexander Bustamante, Donald Sangster and Hugh Shearer. The
growth was fueled by strong investments in bauxite alumina, tourism,
manufacturing industry and to a lesser extent the agricultural sector. However,
the initial optimism of the first decade vanished following a change in
Government  the PNP   People s National Party  in 1972, Jamaica lagged
economically with its gross national product falling in 1980 to some twenty five
percent below the level previously obtained in 1972. Rising foreign and local
debt accompanied by large fiscal deficits resulted in the invitation of the
International Monetary Fund  IMF  financing from the USA and others, and the
imposition of IMF austerity measures  with a greater than 25  interest rate per
year .

Economic deterioration continued into the mid 1980s, exacerbated by the closure
of the first  Alpart  and third  Alcoa  largest alumina producers, significant
reduction in production by the second largest  A</STYLE>
