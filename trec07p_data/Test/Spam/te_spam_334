 Westmorland   formerly also spelt Westmoreland, an even older spelling is
Westmerland  is an area of north west England and one of the 39 historic
counties of England. It formed an administrative county from 1889 to 1974 and
now forms part of Cumbria.

Ancient county /Image  /SizeRank  29th /Size  485,990 acres /CountyTown  Appleby in 
Westmorland /ChapmanCode WES /detailedImage     At the time of the Domesday Book
in 1086 the county was considered to form part of Yorkshire. The baronies of
Kendal and Westmorland were originally distinct jurisdictions with separate
sheriffs, but were formed into a single county of Westmorland in 1226 7. ref
name  youngs  F.A. Youngs, Guide to the Local Administrative units of England,
Vol.II, Northern England, London, 1991  ref 

The historic county boundaries are with Cumberland to the north, County Durham
and Yorkshire to the east, and Lancashire to the south and west. Windermere
forms part of the western border with Lancashire north of the sands, and
Ullswater part of the border with Cumberland.

The highest point of the county is Helvellyn at 950m  3,117 ft . According to
the 1831 census it covers an area of 485,990 acres.  ref 1831 Census cited in

Appleby, the historic county town, formed a historic borough and was unreformed
by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835  although reform came later in 1885.
Kendal was reformed as a municipal borough in 1835.

Division into wards

Rather than being divided into hundreds, Westmorland was subdivided into two
baronies of Westmorland  or sometimes Appleby  and Kendal.

The baronies were further subdivided into two wards each

/AreaLast  504,917 acres /AreaLastYear  1961    In 1889, under the Local
Government Act 1888, a county council was created for Westmorland, taking
functions from the Quarter Sessions. Westmorland did not contain any county
boroughs throughout its history so the administrative county, or area under the
control of the county council, was coterminous with the geographic county. The
county council was based at Kendal, instead of the historic county town of
Appleby.

Aside from the two municipal boroughs of Kendal and Appleby, the Local
Government Act 1894 divided the county into urban districts and rural districts.
  5 Urban districts   Ambleside, Bowness on Windermere, Grasmere, Kirkby
Lonsdale, Windermere   3 Rural districts   West Ward, East Westmorland, South
Westmorland In 1905 a new Shap urban district was formed, while Windermere
absorbed the neighbouring Bowness UD.

A County Review Order in 1935 reduced the number of districts in the county   A
new Lakes Urban District was formed by the merger of Ambleside and Grasmere UDs
and adjacent parishes in West Ward and South Westmorland RDs  East Westmorland
RD, most of West Ward RD andShap UD were merged to form North Westmorland Rural
District  South Westmorland RD absorbed Kirkby Lonsdale UD, at the same time
losing an area to Lakes UD. ref name  youngs   

These divisions lasted until 1974. According to the 1971 census, Westmorland was
the second least populated administrative county in England, after Rutland. The
distribution of population was as follows   ref 1971 Census  Small Area
Statistics  ref 

 / class  wikitable 
/ 
 District//Population
/ 
/Municipal Borough of Appleby // 1,944
/ 
/Municipal Borough of Kendal // 21,602

/Lakes Urban District // 5,815
/ 
/Windermere Urban District // 8,065
/ 
/North Westmorland Rural District // 14,778
/ 
/South Westmorland Rural District // 20,633
/ 

In 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, the county was abolished and its
former area was combined with Cumberland and parts of Lancashire and Yorkshire
to form the new county of Cumbria. The former county now forms part of the
districts of South Lakeland and Eden.
