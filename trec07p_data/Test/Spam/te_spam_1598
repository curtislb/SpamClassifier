I was also a part of this system. Who am I? Well, my introduction remains in constant use of millions of people in this world; "I am common man." And along with all those millions of common men, I lived in this system where we labored our lives. Carrying the burden of compulsive freedom on our shoulders, we were transferred from youth to old age, and from old age to demise. At numerous occasions death separated the youth from old age. Our minds, our thoughts had so unfeelingly become a part of all this. Days, dates, years, all meaningless. Our time scale was the amount of work done by us. How many shoes made, how many drugs packed, how many radios loaded, how many abuses assimilated. We were all inebriated. The dream of change was buried in the grave of our stomachs. And yet, in such a suppressive conditions, an eccentric thing happened; instead of my mind, my heart revolted. In this atmosphere of belligerence and hatred, my heart opted for tolerance and love.

Our intention is to offer to only those interested. If not the mechanizim is in place for you to decide.
