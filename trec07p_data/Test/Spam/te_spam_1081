[http   www.uwindsor.ca  www.uwindsor.ca]    The  University of Windsor   401
Sunset Avenue, Windsor, Ontario N9B 3P4  is a non denominational, provincially 
supported, coeducational, public comprehensive university in Windsor, Ontario,
Canada. It is Canada s southernmost university. It has a student population of
over 15,000 full time and part time undergraduate students and over 1000
graduate students. It is a member of the National Conference of Canadian
Universities and Colleges, the University Articulation Board of Ontario, the
International Association of Universities, and the Association of the British
Commonwealth. More than 80,000 individuals around the world call the University
of Windsor their alma mater.

History ]] In 2003, the university marked its 40th anniversary. Its history
dates back to the founding of Assumption College in 1857. Originally, Assumption
was one the largest colleges associated with the University of Western Ontario.
In 1950, Assumption College welcomed its first women students and in 1953, it
ended its affiliation with the University of Western Ontario and became an
independent institution through an Act of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario.
In 1956, the College changed its name to Assumption University and accepted as
an affiliate the non denominational Essex College. In 1957,
[http   www.uwindsor.ca canterbury Canterbury College] became the first Anglican
college in the world to affiliate with a Roman Catholic University. On December
19, 1962, the University of Windsor was incorporated by the Ontario Legislature,
accepting Assumption University as a federated institution. Soon after,
affiliation agreements were made with Holy Redeemer College, Canterbury College
and the new Iona College  affiliated with the United Church of Canada . On July
1, 1963, the University of Windsor assumed control of the campus.

In 1964 Dr. J. Francis Leddy became President of the University of Windsor, and
presided over a period of significant growth. From 1967 to 1977, Windsor grew
from approximately 1,500 to 8,000 full time students. In the 1980s and early
1990s, this growth continued, particularly under the leadership of President Ron
Ianni. Among the new buildings erected were the Odette Business Building and the
CAW Student Centre.

Currently, Dr. Ross Paul presides over a long range plan to capitalize on
Windsor   s broad range of programs and the university s small size and personal
touch for student learners and researchers. Enrolment reached record heights in
fall 2003 with the elimination of Grade 13  Ontario Academic Credit . In
response, the University of Windsor invested more than $50 million in a new
student residence, the Anthony P. Toldo Health Education Centre, the Jackman
Dramatic Art Centre, and in classroom and lab upgrades. To Greater Heights, the
University of Windsor s strategic plan for 2009 was introduced in fall 2004. The
university has developed a number of partnerships with local businesses and
industry, including the University of Windsor Chrysler Canada Ltd. Automotive
Research and Development Centre.

Academics The university strives to be a student focused teaching and learning
centre. It has developed a number of partnerships with local businesses and
industry, including the multi million dollar University of Windsor Chrysler
Canada Ltd. Automotive Research and Development Centre, the only research
facility of its kind in North America.

Windsor offers more than 140 undergraduate and graduate programs across nine
faculties 

  Faculty of Arts   Social Science
  Faculty of Education
  Faculty of Engineering
  Odette School of Business
  Faculty of Graduate Studies
  Faculty of Human Kinetics

research focus on Social Justice issues. It publishes the law journal Access to
Justice. Students can take advantage of faculty expertise in Human Rights Law,
