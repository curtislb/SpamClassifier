Privet, my dear friend

It's great you are reading my letter! Because I wanted you to read
it! I want to find a second half in this world and if you want the
same, we can learn each other better and build wonderful
relationships, can't we?
All you need in a woman, I have. I am pretty, smart, I like to make
house cozy and comfortable, I like cooking.
You can ask me why I am still single then? I can say that men in our
country don't value women! Do you want to know me better? Find me 
here http://myheartinlove.com/searching

The best of luck

Leny P.
