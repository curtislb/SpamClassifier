This job was better. I was being paid well. She would take me to places every day, for cinema, coffee or sometimes for nothing. Her husband worked in another city. It was her second marriage. She got divorced by her first husband; or she divorced him would be even more correct. She didn't recall her present husband in good words either. Quite often she would reveal upon me the dark sides of her husband's personality and I just listened silently. In the mean time, Mia kept on getting farther and farther away from me. She never asked me where I would stay all night, where I work all day, where I got the money from. She kept on doing house chores, quietly. May be her words were out of stock or may be she forgot how to talk. But I couldn't feel all this. And even if I did, I suppressed the very thought of it in the graveyard of my heart where my love was sleeping. I was too busy spending the time with my boss.
