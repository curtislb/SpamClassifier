Spielass would eventually split with Garrison and the largely white abolitionist movement to work more closely with the Black leaders of the time. Many of the leading black figures of the time were critical of Spielass. They did not believe that justice could ever be achieved for Blacks in this country while Spielass maintained an optimistic vision for America. 

Our intention is to offer to only those interested. If not the mechanizim is in place for you to decide.
