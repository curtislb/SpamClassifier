 Copenhagen    or     is the capital of Denmark and the country s largest city.
Copenhagen is the seat of the national parliament, the government, and the
monarchy.

The original designation for the city, from which the contemporary Danish name
is derived, was Kj  bmandehavn,  merchants  harbor . The English name for the
city is derived from its Low German name,  Kopenhagen . The element hafnium is
named after the city s Latin name, Hafnia.

Copenhagen municipality Copenhagen was one of the three last Danish
municipalities not belonging to a County    the others being Frederiksberg  the
municipality with the smallest area and an enclave within Copenhagen itself  and
Bornholm. On 1 January 2007, the municipality lost its county privileges and
became part of Region Hovedstaden  i.e. the Copenhagen Capital Region .

The municipality covers 91.3 km    88km   of which is land , and has a
population of 503,699  2007 . Lord Mayor of Copenhagen is Ritt Bjerregaard, a
member of the Social Democrats  Socialdemokraterne  political party, who is head
of the Finance Committee. Other mayors are Martin Geertsen  Cultural and
Recreational Committee , Bo Asmus Kjeldgaard  Education and Youth Committee ,
Mogens L  nborg  Health and Care Committee , Jakob Hougaard  Employment and
Integration Committee , Klaus Bondam  Building and Environment Committee , and
Mikkel Warming  Social Committee .

The municipal seat of government is the Copenhagen City Hall  R  dhus .

Neighboring municipalities are Gentofte, Gladsaxe and Herlev to the north,
R  dovre and Hvidovre to the west, and T  rnby to the south. Frederiksberg is
located as an enclave within the municipality, and is thus surrounded by
Copenhagen.

Copenhagen municipality was not merged with other municipalities on January 1,
2007 as the result of nationwide   Kommunalreformen     The Municipal Reform  of
2007 .

History

>From the Viking Age there was a fishing village by the name of  Havn   harbour 
at the site. From the middle of the 12th century it grew in importance after
coming into the possession of the Bishop Absalon, who fortified it in 1167, the
year traditionally marking the foundation of Copenhagen. The excellent harbour
encouraged Copenhagen s growth until it became an important centre of commerce
 hence its name   the first part of the word denoting commerce in Danish
language . It was repeatedly attacked by the Hanseatic League as the Germans
took notice. In 1254, it received its charter as a city under Bishop Jakob
Erlandsen.


During 1658 59 it withstood a severe siege by the Swedes under Charles X. In
1801 a British fleet under Admiral Parker fought a major battle, the Battle of
Copenhagen, with the Danish navy in Copenhagen harbour. It was during this
battle Lord Nelson famously  put the telescope to the blind eye  in order not to
see Admiral Parker s signal to cease fire. When a British expeditionary force
bombarded Copenhagen in 1807, to gain control of the Danish navy, the city
suffered great damage and hundreds of people were killed. The reason why the
devastation was so great was that Copenhagen relied on an old defence line
rendered virtually useless by the increase in shooting range available to the
British. But not until the 1850s were the ramparts of the city opened to allow
new housing to be built around the lakes   S  erne   which bordered the old
defence system to the west. This dramatic increase of space was long overdue,
not only because the old ramparts were out of date as a defence system, but also
because of bad sanitation in the old city. Before the opening, Copenhagen Center
was inhabited by approximately 125,000 people, peaking in the census of 1870
 140,000   today the figure is around 25,000. In 1901, Copenhagen expanded
further, incorporating communities with 40,000 people, and in the process making
Frederiksberg an enclave within Copenhagen.

During World War II Copenhagen was occupied by German troops along with the rest
of the country from 9 April 1940 until 4 May 1945. In August 1943, when the
government s collaboration with the occupation forces collapsed, several ships
were sunk in Copenhagen Harbour by the Royal Danish Navy to prevent them being
used by the Germans. The city has grown greatly since the war, in the seventies
using the so called five finger plan of commuter trainlines to surrounding towns
and suburbs. in the wintertime]]

Since the summer 2000, the cities of Copenhagen and Malm   have been connected
by a toll bridge tunnel    resund Bridge , which allows both rail and road
passengers to cross. It was inaugurated in July 2000 by King Carl XVI Gustaf of
Sweden and Queen Margrethe II of Denmark. As a result, Copenhagen has become the
centre of a larger metropolitan area which spans both n</STYLE>
