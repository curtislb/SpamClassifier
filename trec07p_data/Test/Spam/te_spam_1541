Dear Sir,
I am Mr. Mathew Kuruneri, the son of Dr. Christopher Kuruneri, who until rec=
ently the Zimbabwean Minister for finance in the present Robert Mugabe=E2=
=80=99s government in Zimbabwe.
=20
First and foremost, I apologized using this medium  to reach you for a trans=
action / business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and=20=
prompt access reposed on this medium. In unfolding this proposal, I want to=20=
count on you, as a respected and honest person to handle this transaction wi=
th sincerity, trust and confidentiality. I have decided to seek a confidenti=
al co-operation with you in the execution of the transaction described hereu=
nder for the benefit of all parties involved and hope you will keep it as a=20=
top secret because of the nature of this transaction.
=20
Because of what is happening in the world today and to verify my predicament=
s as well as my sincerity, I would like you to visit the site below to read=20=
more about my father.
http://www.news24.com/News24/Africa/Zimbabwe/0,,2-11-259_1518150,00.html
http://www.zimbabwesituation.com/mar24a_2004.html#link2

Precisely, on The 24th of April 2004, the security goons of President Robert=
 Mugabe in what was an excessive and unprecedented use of force arrested my=20=
father while still a Government Minister at our family house in Harare. He w=
as arrested on the allegation that his building of a Thirty Million Rand (i.=
e. US$ 8 Million) beach front mansion in Llandudno, Cape Town, South Africa=20=
was in contravention of Zimbabwe=E2=80=99s regulation on Foreign exchange co=
ntrol. Though, my father has repeatedly made it clear that he did not in any=
way contravene this regulation, maintaining, that he was funding the housing=
 project from funds he made through his business ventures and consultancies=20=
work outside Zimbabwe prior to his becoming a minister, and that the funds w=
ere never held nor transferred from Zimbabwean banks, charges, are yet to be=
 laid against him in a court of law. My father has been held in solitary con=
finement and under severe inhuman conditions in the gulag of Mugabe despite=20=
several efforts and calls for him to be charged before a competent court or=20=
be released.
=20
However, my family is undoubtedly aware of the underlying political intrigue=
 and vendetta that is involved in this case than meets the eyes. It simply h=
as to do with my fathers uncompromising stance against the oppressive police=
s and unwholesome activities of President Robert Mugabe, besides, my father=
=E2=80=99s recent rising popularity within the ruling ZANU-PF party, and aro=
und the country and his touting as a possible successor to President Robert=20=
Mugabe. My family was aware, that Mugabe was very uncomfortable with this si=
tuation and knew, that it was matter of time before he moved against him, bu=
t, unfortunately, lest did we anticipated it in this most bizarre and barbar=
ic manner. Being aware of Robert Mugabe=E2=80=99s antecedents, to say, that=20=
my father and the entire family entertain great concern and apprehension abo=
ut his life and that of the other members of our family, is to state the obv=
ious. It is obvious from his actions; President Robert Mugabe is out to dest=
roy the family politically, financially and otherwise.
=20
Presently, I have moved with the rest of my family into South Africa, where=20=
we have managed to gain asylum. However, the tactic support for President Mu=
gabe from the present South African Government, coupled with the proximity o=
f both countries makes our continued stay and hope for a future in South Afr=
ica most risky and uncomfortable. In the meantime, I have been mandated by m=
y father, to explore avenues and make every necessary arrangements immediate=
ly to move our only left fund, since  others has been seized, out of this co=
untry and also make arrangements to resettle the rest  of my family in any o=
f such country. At present, I am desperately seeking your assistance in help=
ing me transfer the sum of Twenty million, five hundred thousand United Stat=
es dollars (Us$20.5m)  being the total sum deposited with a security and fin=
ance company here in Johannesburg South Africa to your country for viable in=
vestment.=20
Unfortunately, under the recent South African Financial intelligence center=20=
Act (FICA) and the Exchange Control Regulations as a refugee I am highly con=
strained from personally transferring this money out of South Africa. Howeve=
r, this could easily be effected with the representation / assistance by a n=
ationals of a different country apart from nationals of the Southern African=
 Development Countries, SADC, hence my writing.
=20
The original document that shows the Deed of lodge, Proof of Deposit, and De=
pository Agreement between my late father and the Management of the Security=
 Company are with my mother.
=20
I have the authority of my family to propose that should you be willing to a=
ssist us in this transaction your share of compensation will be US$5.125m (2=
5%), while my family takes US$13.325m (65%) and the balance of US$2.5m (10%)=
 for miscellaneous expenses that may be incurred by either party during the=20=
transfer.
=20
I want to let you know that this transaction is 100% risk free provided you=20=
treat it with utmost confidentiality because the Zimbabwean Government are b=
ent on collecting all assets / properties belonging to my father. Please end=
eavor to contact me via my Email address as given above.
=20
Finally, I do hope of establishing a good relationship with you and your fam=
ily after this transaction. I wait to hear from you.
=20
Yours faithfully,
=20
Mr. Mathew Kuruneri
