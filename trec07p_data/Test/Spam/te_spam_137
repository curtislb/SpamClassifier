 Marcus [[Tullius]] Cicero   IPA Classical Latin pronunciation  , usually
pronounced in American English or in UK English  January 3, 106 BC  ndash 
December 7, 43 BC  was a Roman statesman, lawyer, political theorist,
philosopher, widely considered one of Rome s greatest orators and prose
stylists. ref Rawson, E.  Cicero, a portrait  1975  p.303  ref  ref  Haskell,
H.J.  This was Cicero  1964 p.300 301  ref 

Cicero is widely recognized as one of the most versatile minds of Roman culture
and his writing the paragon of Classical Latin. He introduced the Romans to the
chief schools of Greek philosophy and created a Latin philosophical vocabulary.
An impressive orator and successful lawyer, Cicero likely thought his political
career his most important achievement. But today he is appreciated primarily for
his humanism and philosophical and political writings. His voluminous
correspondence has been especially influential, introducing the art of refined
letter writing to European culture. A Roman living in the first century AD has
said that we do not need a history of Rome of the first century BC because we
have Cicero s letters.

During the chaotic latter half of the first century BC, marked by civil wars and
the dictatorship of C. Julius Caesar, Cicero championed a return to the
traditional republican government  however, his career as a statesman was marked
by inconsistencies and a tendency to shift his position in response to changes
in the political climate. His vacillations may be attributed to his sensitive
and impressionable personality  he was prone to overreact to political and
private changes.  Would that he had been able to endure prosperity with greater
self control and adversity with more fortitude   wrote C. Asinius Pollio, a
contemporary Roman statesman and historian. ref Haskell,H.J.  This was Cicero 
 1964  p.296   ref  ref  Castren and Pietil   Castren   Antiikin k  sikirja 
  Handbook of antiquity   2000  p.237  ref  His inability to persevere with
calm, unswerving determination was his main
weakness. ref www.chlt.org sandbox perseus abb.ci_eng page  The Private Life of
Cicero   ref 

Childhood and family

Cicero was born 3 January 106 BC farm in Arpinum  modern day Arpino , a town 100
kilometres  70 miles  south of Rome. The Arpinians received Roman citizenship in
188 BC and had already started to speak Latin rather than their native
Volscian. ref Rawson, E.  Cicero, a portrait  1975  p.1  ref  This made Cicero s
future as an orator and writer possible  if he had spent his childhood speaking
Volscian he would never have become the exponent of classical Latin that he
become.

At this period in Roman history, all cultured persons were bilingual, speaking
both Greek and Latin. The Roman elite often preferred Greek, because it was a
more evolved language and richer in nuances than Latin. Fortunately, Greek was
taught already in the primary schools of Arpinum. ref Rawson,E.  Cicero, a
portrait   1975  p.7.  ref  Later, Cicero studied rhetoric primarily in Greek
because most prominent teachers of oratory at that time were
Greeks. ref Rawson,E.  Cicero, a portrait   1975  p.8  ref  He later put his
Greek education to good use, translating the theoretical concepts of Greek
philosophy into Latin.

Cicero s family belonged to the local gentry, domi nobiles but had no familial
ties with the Roman senatorial class. However, Cicero was distantly related to
one notable person born in Arpinium, Gaius Marius. ref Rawson, E.  Cicero, a
portrait   1975  p.2 3  ref  Marius led the [[populares]] faction during a Civil
War against the [[optimates]], led by Lucius Cornelius Sulla in the 80s BC.
Cicero received little political benefit from this connection. In fact, it may
have hindered his political aims, as the Marian faction was ultimately
defeated. ref Rawson, E.  Cicero, a portrait  1975  p.17  ref 

Cicero s father was a well to do [[Equestrian  Roman /equestrian]]  knight  with
good connections in Rome. Though he was a semi invalid who could not enter
public life, he compensated for this by studying extensively. Cicero s mother
was named Helvia. Little is known about her other than what is recorded in a
letter by Cicero s brother, Quintus  apparently, she was a thrifty
housewife. ref Rawson, E.  Cicero, a portrait  1975  p.5 6  Cicero, Ad
Familiares [http   www.perseus.tufts.edu cgi bin ptext?lookup Cic.+Fam.+16.26.2
16.26.2]  Quintus to Cicero   ref 

The name Cicero is derived from the Latin word cicer, meaning chickpea. Plutarch
explains that the name was originally given to one of Cicero s ancestors who had
a cleft in the tip of his nose resembling a chickpea. Plutarch adds that Cicero
was urged to change this deprecatory name when he entered politics, but he
refused, saying that he would make Cicero more glorious than Scaurus   Swollen 
ankled   and Catulus   Puppy  . ref Plutarch, Cicero [http   penelope.uchicago. 
edu Thayer E Roman Texts Plutarch Lives Cicero .html 1.3 1.3 ndash 5]  ref 

Early life and studies .]] According to Plutarch, Cicero was an extremely
talented student, whose learning attracted attention from all over
Rome  ref Plutarch, Cicero [http   penelope.uchicago.edu Thayer E Roman Texts P 
lutarch Lives Cicero .html 2.2 2.2]  ref  he was granted the opportunity to
study Roman law under Quintus Mucius Scae</STYLE>
