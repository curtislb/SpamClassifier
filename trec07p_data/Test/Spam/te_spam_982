A  bat  is a mammal in the order  Chiroptera . Their most distinguishing feature
is that their forelimbs are developed as wings, making them the only mammals in
the world naturally capable of flight  other mammals, such as flying squirrels
and gliding phalangers, can glide for limited distances but are not capable of
true sustainable flight . The word Chiroptera can be translated from the Greek
words for  hand wing,  as the structure of the open wing is very similar to an
outspread human hand with a membrane  patagium  between the fingers that also
stretches between hand and body.

There are estimated to be about 1,100 species of bats worldwide, accounting for
about 20  of all mammal species. ref name  tudge    ref  About 70  of bats are
insectivores. Of the remainder, most feed on fruits and their juices  three
species sustain themselves with blood and some prey on vertebrates. These bats
include the leaf nosed bats  Phyllostomidae  of Central America and South
America, and the related bulldog bats  Noctilionidae  that feed on fish. At
least two known species of bat feed on other bats  the Spectral Bat, also called
the American False Vampire bat, and the Ghost Bat of Australia. One species, the
Greater Noctule bat, is believed to catch and eat small birds in the air.
Despite the cold weather, there are 6 species of bats in Alaska.

Some of the smaller bat species are important pollinators of some tropical
flowers. Indeed, many tropical plants are now found to be totally dependent on
them, not just for pollination, but for spreading their seeds by eating the
resulting fruits. This role explains environmental concerns when a bat is
introduced in a new setting. Tenerife provides a recent example with the
introduction of the Egyptian fruit bat.

Classification and evolution

, Acerodon jubatus]] , Vespertilio murinus]] , Pipistrellus pipistrellus]] Bats
are mammals. Though sometimes called  flying rodents ,  flying mice,  or even
mistaken for insects and birds, bats are not, in fact, rodents. There are two
suborders of bats 

  Megachiroptera  megabats 
  Microchiroptera  microbats echolocating bats 

Despite the name, not all megabats are larger than microbats. The major
distinction between the two suborders is based on other factors 
  Microbats use echolocation, whereas megabats do not  except for [[Rousettus]]
  and relatives, which do .
  Microbats lack the claw at the second toe of the forelimb.
  The ears of microbats do not form a closed ring, but the edges are separated
  from each other at the base of the ear.
  Microbats lack underfur  they have only guard hairs or are naked.

Megabats eat fruit, nectar or pollen while microbats eat insects, blood  small
quantities of the blood of animals , small mammals, and fish, relying on
echolocation for navigation and finding prey.

Genetic evidence indicates that megabats should be placed within the four major
lines of microbats  Yinochiroptera , who originated during the early Eocene. The
same research also seems to show that the microbats are the original bats while
megabats evolved from them independently through parallel evolution, where most
of them lost the ability to use echolocation.

There is some morphological evidence that Megachiroptera evolved flight
separately from Microchiroptera  if so, the Microchiroptera would have uncertain
affinities. When adaptations to flight are discounted in a cladistic analysis,
the Megachiroptera are allied to primates by anatomical features that are not
shared with Microchiroptera. But this alternative seems to have little support
these days.

Little is known about the evolution of bats, since their small, delicate
