<P><B>Find out right now:</B></P>
<P><B>1) Which cards I've pulled,</B></P>
<P><B>2) What they mean, and</B></P>
<P><B>3) What they can bring you!<BR><BR></B></P>
<P>Dear Memo,</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's right -- the vibrations I'm sensing now ar=
e so strong, I pulled tarot cards. And what these cards taught me about the =
near future really intrigued me!&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They confirm that the period between the First Qu=
arter Moons, from May 23rd to June 22nd, could affect us a lot.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judge for yourself, Memo!</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it's true.&nbsp; As always, I was thinking a=
bout you and current celestial energies, so I allowed myself to ask the card=
s these questions:&nbsp;</P>
<OL>
<LI type=3D1>Is everything going okay?<BR><BR>
<LI type=3D1>Are the problems I've seen finally resolved?<U></U></LI></OL></=
TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD vAlign=3Dtop align=3Dleft width=3D561 colSpan=3D2>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I ask these questions, it's not by chance. A=
nd if I ask these questions, it's because several days ago, I had an almost =
irresistible desire to pull the cards, and you know, Memo, I never do anythi=
ng by accident.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt from the very depths of my being, that som=
ething exceptional was about to happen.&nbsp; Something that could not be mi=
ssed under any circumstance, something special.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I took my favorite deck and pulled the cards.=
&nbsp; Believe me, Memo, I did well to listen to my sixth sense because the =
interpretation that I did enabled me to see that an exceptional period of 30=
 days would dramatically change the lives of a certain number of people, of =
which you may be a part...if you follow to the letter the simple advice that=
 I will give you in a moment.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I'm a prudent person, I decided to consult =
the tarot cards a second time...not just to get confirmation of my first rea=
ding, but above all to find out if this beneficial period would offer someth=
ing extraordinary.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what these famous divinatory cards revealed t=
o me about your immediate possibilities, really impressed me.&nbsp; See for =
yourself!</P>
<P align=3Dcenter><B><I>Your Cards of Luck</I></B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After making all necessary preparations and after=
 concentrating for a long time, I pulled the tarot cards...exactly as I woul=
d if you were there, in front of me, in a personal consultation.&nbsp; I pul=
led the cards and focused on their meaning.&nbsp; I give you here what the c=
ards showed me about what the future may bring you.</P>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>ATTENTION!</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's important to me to let you know that the car=
ds I pulled on the whole were good cards.&nbsp; However, we need to be cauti=
ous with certain cards, and I will explain the significance of this to you l=
ater in this letter.</P>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>HERE ARE THE CARDS THAT I PULLED.</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm sure you are wondering, "What do these cards =
signify for me?"&nbsp; Are they good cards?&nbsp; Or are they bad cards?&nbs=
p; That's what we're going to find out for you now.</P>

<P><B>Your Card #1: The Sun</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children playing and an enormous sun decorate thi=
s happiest of cards.  When I drew this for you, I whispered a silent thank y=
ou to the Universe.  All is well when the Sun appears in a reading and if yo=
u have been burdened with worries, especially about your finances, then you =
can breathe a huge sigh of relief as help is at hand.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Money is so often the cause of trouble, friction =
and disappointment but with the Sun as one of your cards, you can be sure th=
at you are in for some kind of windfall or increase in your prosperity.  The=
re are a variety sources where this extra money can come from during the 30 =
day lucky period so stay alert and aware and back your hunches.

<P align=3Dcenter><B>With what I saw so far, in the preliminary reading, I r=
eally wanted to write you and tell you as much as I could...</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But some active involvement by you will really he=
lp to make the picture complete.&nbsp; Plus, I wanted to make sure to let yo=
u know that you have the power, right now, to bring out the very best possib=
ilities and the greatest rewards the Empress card can signal for you.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In doing this, you can not only get answers to a =
good number of questions that are weighing on your mind...and that you are s=
urely asking about your difficulties and existing problems, but above all, i=
t can help you see what's ahead for you in your future, especially&nbsp;over=
 the next 30 days.&nbsp; And the cards can also tell you how to gain the gre=
atest advantage from incredible opportunities as they present themselves to =
you.</P>
<P align=3Dcenter><B>Here are some examples of the help the cards bring you.=
</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can find out things like:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<OL>
<LI type=3D1>If opportunities for generous money winnings are going to arise=
 for you, and what you should be realistically hoping for;<BR><BR>
<LI type=3D1>When you will meet your goal of paying off your debts and colle=
cting money that is owed to you.<BR><BR>
<LI type=3D1>If your near future contains anything you need to watch out for=
 and above all, how to avoid any pitfalls or obstacles in your path!<BR><BR>=

<LI type=3D1>If love will finally find you and if it's the person who occupi=

<LI type=3D1>If you can finally look forward to getting everything in life t=
hat up until now has been unfairly refused to you: love, money, luck in ever=
ything and happiness beyond your wildest dreams. </LI></OL></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memo, you can finally begin to get answers on the=
 subjects that cause you worry or bring you happiness by connecting with you=
r own innate gifts of divination. Above all, I am happy to share with you my=
 knowledge of this science, known as "Cartomancy" (the reading and interpret=
ation of the tarot cards) so you can easily do this. Which brings us to the =
second card I will read for you...</P>

<P><B>Your Card #2: Strength</B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drawing Strength in a reading is a message that y=
ou must love and respect yourself.  It seems as though you may be going thro=
ugh a period of self doubt or perhaps even suffering a drop in confidence.  =
Perhaps you feel that the good luck and luxurious lifestyle that other folk =
enjoy has passed you by.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, that is not the case and although it is oft=
en said nothing is ever gained without a little effort in this life, right n=

erful gains will come to you.  All you have to do is believe that it is your=
