Greetings,

I am Jones Masinga, I represent a top mining company executive in South
Africa. I have a very sensitive and private brief from this top executive
to ask for your partnership to re-profile funds totally Forty Two Million
United States Dollars($42,000,000.00)


I will give the details of how we intend to proceed,this is a legitimate
transaction. You will be paid 15% for your "management fees", if I am able
to reach terms with you.

If you are interested, please write me back by email and provide me with
your full names, telephone/cell numbers and I will provide further
details.



Please keep this close to your chest as much as possible; we are still in
acting service.



Regards,

Dr.Jones Masinga
