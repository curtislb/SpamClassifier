The  Common Raven   Corvus corax , also known as the  Northern Raven , is a
large all black passerine bird in the crow family. Found across the northern
hemisphere, it is the most widely distributed of all corvids. ref name  Helm  
Helm Identification Guides, Crows and Jays by Steve Madge and Hilary Burn ISBN
0 7136 3999 7   ref  There are eight known subspecies, and recent molecular
studies suggest that there are actually two or more species. ref name  
 Feld05    ref name     Bakom06   

At maturity, the Raven is between 56 to 69 nbsp cm  22 to 27 nbsp inches  in
length, with recorded weights ranging from 0.69 to 1.63 nbsp kg  1.5 to 3.6
pounds.  Together with the Thick billed Raven, it is the largest corvid and
possibly the heaviest passerine bird.

The Common Raven has succesfully coexisted with humans for thousands of years.
Part of its success comes from its omnivorous diet, as ravens are extremely
versatile and opportunistic in finding sources of nutrition. They feed on
carrion, insects, and garbage, in addition to cereal grains, berries, fruit, and
small animals.

Some remarkable feats of problem solving have been observed in the species,
leading to the belief that it has great intelligence. The Common Raven been
revered and worshipped in cultures as diverse as Norse and Native American, and
has been the subject of art, literature, folklore and symbolism over the
centuries.

Taxonomy The Common Raven was one of the original species described by Linnaeus
in the 18th century and it still bears its original name of Corvus corax. The
specific epithet corax            is the Greek word for crow. ref    ref 

Though the name  raven  has been applied to several other species of the genus
[[Crow/Corvus]], it originally referred to this species. The word itself is
similar in many old Germanic languages  the Old English word for a raven was
hr  fn  in Old Norse it was hrafn and Old High German  h raban. ref Simpson J,
Weiner E. eds   1989  Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd edition, Clarendon Press,
ISBN 0 19 861186 2  ref  An old Scottish word corby or corbie, akin to the
French corbeau, has been used for both this bird and the Carrion Crow. ref name
   CotW83     ref  Subspecies The Common Raven has eight recognized subspecies 

   C. c. corax   nominate race  occurs from Europe eastwards to Lake Baikal
  region, south to Caucasus and northern Iran. It has a relatively short, arched
  bill.
   C. c. varius  occurs in Iceland and the Faroe Islands. It is less glossy than
  C. c. principalis or nominate corax. It is intermediate in size, and the bases
  of neck feathers are whitish.
   C. c. subcorax  occurs from Greece eastwards to north west India, Central
  Asia and western China  except Himalayan region . It is larger than the
  nominate form, but the throat hackles are relatively short. The neck and
  breast are distinctly brownish  similar to Brown necked Raven  but obscured by
  glossy black when the plumage is very fresh. The bases of the neck feathers
  are variable in colour, often almost whitish.
   C. c. tingitanus  occurs in North Africa and the Canary islands. It is the
  smallest race, with the shortest throat hackles and a distinctly oily plumage
  gloss. Its bill is short but markedly shout and the culmen is strongly arched.
  The plumage bleaches dark brown on head and body.
   C. c. tibetanus  occurs in the mountains of western Chi</STYLE>
