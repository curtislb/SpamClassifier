Trembling winter. Lonely afternoon. Muddy clouds. Some melancholic rays peeping through those dusty cornflakes in the sky. Death faced skyscrapers. A road polluted with clumsy vehicles. Countless worn-out faces rolling on the road. Silently breathing hearts. Eyes fed up with monotony. Venomous minds. Incarcerated souls and frail bodies carrying the burden of forced freedom____

Our intention is to offer to only those interested. If not the mechanizim is in place for you to decide.
