Foundation stone and Stone Day



At the end of the year, after classes finish but before exams, Stone Day is
usually held, a music festival with local bands, which lasts several days. The
day before it is known as Stone Eve. It started as a celebration held annually
to mark the placing of the foundation stone by Prime Minister John Gorton on 28
October, 1968. This founded the Canberra College of Advanced Education, which
became the University of Canberra in 1990.

The stone is under glass, outside, near Building 1 at the University, and an
inscription on it reads 

  quote/This Stone was unveiled by the right honourable J.G. Gorton, M.P., Prime
Minister of Australia, on the 28th of October 1968, to mark the establishment of
the Canberra College of Advanced Education.   

Over the years the Stone Day program has gradually become larger and larger,
taking up a whole week and now StoneFest is one of Australia s most popular
music festivals. The first foundation celebrations were held in 1971. In 1973
Stone Day celebrations were held over two days, which was expanded to take up a
whole week in 1976. In the 1980s and 1990s Stoneweek became a popular Canberra
entertainment event, which in 2000 became Stonefest. In 2004, artists who
appeared at StoneFest included  Something for Kate, Von Bondies, Groove Armada,
Butterfingers, and Rocket Science.
