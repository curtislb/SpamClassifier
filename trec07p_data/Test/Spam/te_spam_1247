Dear valued member.
It’s your therapist’s assistant writing to you. I just wanted to give you some really useful advice on how to shop for drugs online.
If you prefer shopping for meds on the Internet, remember three basic tips on how to choose a reliable e-shop:1)      the pharmacy should be well-known (for example, USDrugs)2)      it should be licensed3)      the drugs offered should be generic
Don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions concerning the information provided.
