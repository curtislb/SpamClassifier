Dear customer.Many people say that saving money on medications is impossible without risking your health. However, our licensed CanadianPharmacy proves that it's not right."High price proves the high quality of the drug" That's what all Web pharmacies say in their ads. All except CanadianPharmacy. Drug sales tax is much lower here in Canada so we don't have any trouble dumping our rivals into tears. CanadianPharmacy generic quality CAN be cheap.CanadianPharmacy no one is able to match our prices for generic medications neither in Canada nor in the USA.Yours faithfully,Luke Hughes
