   Uncle Jehiel, it does seem to me I cant have it so! All my life Ive looked forward to bein a sailor and goin around the world, and all. I just hate the valley and the mountains! But I guess I got to stay. Shes only my step-mother, I know, but she was always awful good to me, and she hasnt got anybody else to look after her. His voice broke, and he put his arm up in a crook over his face. But its awful hard! I feel like a bird thats got caught in a snare. 
has gone to a better Land; all that is left  of  it  for its  loved  Ones tolament over, is this  poor smoldering Ash-heap. Ah, woeful, woeful Ash-heap!Let us take him up tenderly, reverently, upon the lowly Shovel, and bear himto his long Rest,  with the  Prayer that  when  he rises again it will be  aRealm where he will have one good square responsible Sex, and have it all toimself, instead of having a mangy lot of assorted Sexes  scattered all overhim in Spots.
I am  not  getting along at  all. I have worked at it  hard for three level
