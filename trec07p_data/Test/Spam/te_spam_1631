" Mia! I know you must be expecting a gift from me on our wedding night. I hate to disappoint you but the fact is that I couldn't buy you a gift. Not because I didn't have enough money or that I couldn't remember but because I couldn't find something as gorgeous as you are. Everything looked dull compared to you. So I thought I better ask you. I'll get you whatever you want."

Our intention is to offer to only those interested. If not the mechanizim is in place for you to decide.
