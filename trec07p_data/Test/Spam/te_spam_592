P>
<P><FONT face=3D"Courier New" color=3Dblack size=3D2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past few weeks I've talked about how succes=
s-minded thinking requires a willingness to view life with a positive perspe=
ctive.&nbsp; It also calls for persistence and determination.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Calvin Coolidge wrote: &quot;Press on. Nothing=
 can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; the world is full of un=
successful people with talent.&nbsp; Genius will not; unrewarded genius is a=
lmost a proverb.&nbsp; Education alone will not; the world is full of educat=
ed derelicts.&nbsp; Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.&quot=
;
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help you stay persistent and embrace success-m=
inded thinking, commit yourself to building and maintaining friendships and =
contacts that enrich and enhance your life, and your dreams.&nbsp; I like to=
 call these people &quot;true fans and supporters.&quot;&nbsp; They are the =
ones who believe in you and want you to achieve your desires.&nbsp; They che=
er you on, celebrate your accomplishments, and lift you up when you are feel=
ing down.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The saying, &quot;misery loves company&quot; is a=
ll too true, so limit time and set clear boundaries with those who are const=
antly negative, unsupportive and drain your precious energy.&nbsp; They are =
on a different path than you.&nbsp; Perhaps your positive ways and abundant =
life will influence them to make a change in their own life, perhaps not.&nb=
sp; Remember you can't make anyone change who is not ready.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep the focus on yourself.&nbsp; Surround yourse=
lf with positive like-minded people. Press on, Memo.&nbsp; Great success wil=
l come if you are persistent.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are here to help you every step of the way.
