 Hastings  is a town and local government district in South East England, in the
county of East Sussex. It is best known for its connection with the Battle of
Hastings 1066, which actually occurred north of the town at Senlac Hill  the
battle is commemorated today in the town of Battle. Hastings was one of the
Cinque Ports, but its significance as a port declined after the 19th Century and
its main industry became fishing. It still has the largest beach based fishing
fleet in England. From a fishing port it became a watering place and finally a
seaside resort in Victorian times.

History For the history and etymology of the place name see in Wiktionary.  

Excavations in local caves have revealed flint arrowheads and Bronze Age
artefacts  and Iron Age forts on both the East and West Hills have been
excavated, showing that the area has been settled for thousands of years. It is
possible that the settlement was already a port when the Romans arrived in
Britain.

The main interest in Hastings for the Romans was the presence in Wealden rocks
of iron ore  many sites were being worked. The largest of these was at Beauport
Park, which was considered one of the largest in the Roman Empire, employing up
to one thousand men. Little now remains of the industry  it may well have been
the victim of coastal erosion.

The town of H  stingas  probably referring to the followers of an Anglo Saxon
leader called H  sta  is mentioned in documents from the eighth century,
referring to  Hastingacaestre , showing that a castle existed here under their
time. A royal mint was established there in AD 928, during the reign of
Athelstan. Their port was possibly situated at what is now the western end of
the town, at Bulverhythe.

A key work is Historic Hastings sup 1  sup  by a former curator of Hastings
Museum.

The Norman invasion
   Main article  Battle of Hastings.
William the Conqueror made his headquarters in the castle on his arrival in
England. The Battle of Hastings was fought eight miles north at Senlac Hill, now
in the town of Battle, East Sussex. The battle took place on the 14th of
October, after William had landed on the coast between Hastings and Eastbourne
at a site now known as Norman s Bay. In this battle, William defeated and killed
Harold Godwinson, the last Saxon King of England, and destroyed his army,
opening England to the Norman conquest. After the conquest, William built a
castle at Hastings, as depicted on the Bayeux Tapestry, probably using the
earthworks of the existing Saxon castle.

Hastings as a port By the end of the Saxon period, Hastings had moved eastward,
near the present town centre in the Priory Stream valley, whose entrance was
protected by the White Rock headland  since demolished . It was to be a short
stay, however  Danish attacks and huge floods in 1011 and 1014 motivated the
townspeople to relocate to the New Burg in what is now the Old Town valley,
founded in 1069.

In the middle ages Hastings became one of the Cinque Ports  Sandwich, Dover, and
New Romney being the first, Hastings, and Hythe followed, all finally being
joined by Rye and Pevensey, at one point 42 towns were directly or indirectly
affiliated to the group.

In the 13th century much of the town was washed away by the sea. In 1339 and
1377 the town was raided and burnt by the French, and seems then to have gone
into a decline. As a port, Hastings suffered over the years from the lack of a
natural harbour. There were many attempts to create a sheltered harbour, and in
1897 the foundation stone was laid of a large concret</STYLE>
