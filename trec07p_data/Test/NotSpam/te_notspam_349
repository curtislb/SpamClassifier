For merging, selecting and aggregating, R is not too bad:
I believe the following code is more or less equivalent to your Vilno
example, isn't?


# to input data, replace the following two lline by 'read.table'
labresults <- data.frame(patient.id=gl(10,5), visit.num=gl(5,10),
sodium=rnorm(50))
demo <- data.frame(patient.id=gl(10,1), gender=gl(2,5,labels=c('F','M')))

data <- merge(labresults, demo)
data <- subset(data, visit.num!=2)
with(data,
     aggregate(sodium, list(gender=gender), mean)
     )


If the data sets are very large, then doing merges/selection/aggregation
outside of R can be a good idea.
