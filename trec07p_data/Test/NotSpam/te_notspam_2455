Subject: SWF::Builder ActionScript classpath
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hello,
I have been using SWF::Builder to create swf files from actionscript ( 
.as files ).  It works great until I try to use some actionscript with 
an import statement, then I get this error:
Syntax error. ';' is expected. in 1

I don't think there are any issues with the code because it is part of a 
sample provided.  I think my probelm is that I don't have the classpath 
set right.  I found this line in the sample instructions:
"If you want to use the accompanying ActionScript libraries, you will 
want to add the |/lib/| directory to your Classpath in the Flash 
authoring environment."
How do I add to the Flash Authoring Environment Classpath when I am 
using SWF::Builder to generate the swf files?
I tried using:
$ENV{'CLASSPATH'} = '/path/to/lib';
in the perl script, but it did not help.
Any help is appreciated.
Thank you.
Shannon
