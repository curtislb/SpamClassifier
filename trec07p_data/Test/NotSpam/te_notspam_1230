We would not be necessarily relicensing to GPL version 3.

The paragraph "On Debian systems the GPL is in /usr/share/common-licenses"
is mainly for informational purposes. The license for the package
would still be the one in the source code, and it would be as well
the one in the copyright file.

In other words, I think it would be ok if our copyright files were worded
like this:

This program is free software. It is under GPL version 2 or later. On Debian
systems, the latest GPL version is in /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL.
