There currently isn't any way to add vtable overrides to the class's 
list of vtable overrides, so this is temporary (and actually, I thought 
you put it in).

The problem is that Object was poking directly into the internals of 
Class, which definitely breaks encapsulation between the two. Object 
needs a standard interface in Class that it can query for methods. It 
doesn't have to be find_method.
