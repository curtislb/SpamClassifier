SatCon Receives over $2.8 Million in New Fuel Cell Inverter Orders




BOSTON, Jun 26, 2007 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- SatCon Technology Corporation(R)
(Nasdaq CM: SATC), a developer of power management and system
architecture solutions for the alternative energy and distributed power
markets today announced that it has received a purchase order in excess
of $2.8 million for its PowerGate(R) inverters and electrical balance of
plant equipment. The inverter power system is for use on DFC1500MA(TM)
megawatt-class fuel cells designed and manufactured by FuelCell Energy,
Inc. (NasdaqNM:FCEL). The DFC1500MA(TM) fuel cell currently has a
nominal rating of 1.2 megawatts. Delivery of the PowerGate inverters is
scheduled over the next four to nine months. 

FCEL is a world leading developer, manufacturer and supplier of
ultra-clean fuel cell power plants that generate electricity with higher
efficiency than other distributed generation plants of similar size. 

"This order represents a clear sign that fuel cell power plants are a
commercial reality, and we are pleased to be supporting FuelCell Energy
with its commercialization program", said Clemens van Zeyl, President of
SatCon Power Systems. "SatCon is committed to FuelCell Energy's
commercialization program that includes continuous improvement in costs,
delivery and reliability through new packaging concepts, global sourcing
and manufacturing techniques." 

About PowerGate(TM) Inverters 

PowerGate(TM) inverters are designed for use with alternative energy
power systems to generate distributed electrical power. Distributed,
alternative energy power generation is a growing trend toward the
production of clean, reliable power at the point of use. Alternative
energy systems can alleviate congestion on highly loaded utility
electrical distribution networks and offer an alternative to power line
extensions in remote areas. Many alternative energy power systems
require high-power, high-reliability inverters and controls to convert
the power generated to useable AC power compatible with the electric
power grid. 

About SatCon Technology Corporation 

SatCon Technology Corporation is a developer and manufacturer of power
systems utilizing power electronics, advanced controls and
generators/motors for the Alternative Energy, Power Delivery,
Hybrid-Electric Vehicle, and Grid Support markets. SatCon also develops
and manufactures High Reliability Electronics and Advanced Power
Technologies. For further information, please visit the SatCon website
