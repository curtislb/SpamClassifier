It is a free country, and in the name of good capitalism, people have the 
right to create anything legal and sell it.
It is just a shame that the poorest group of individuals have to be kept 
down by having to pay 5 to 10 times for a product that the sighted  have 
access to.
We are an "easy target" for a developer out there, and they pat themselves 
on the back telling themselves that they have done such a good thing, by 
creating a product that allows us access, and indeed, they may not be making 
any more than if they had created a slightly popular product for the 
sighted, but they could contribute more to society by contributing in an 
open-source environment, and not try to see themselves as altruistic, or 
otherwise great slayers to the so called plight of the Blind.

I really don't have a problem paying for software I use be
it to make otherwise usable software accessible or simply
to get a job done.  As far as I'm concerned, the makers of
access tech can charge any amount they'd like.  If it's too
expensive, people will either not use it or more likely
develope their own solutions which doesn't hurt opensource
in the slightest.

Not trying to justify closed source software at all as the
key advantage of open source for me anyway isn't its free
of charge nature but rather for the ability to modify it to
suit my needs.

For those who think prices are inflated by the greedy
corporation, if that were the case and so much profit was
being made in the area, why haven't other firms entered the
market, driving prices down as a result?
