gls() from the package nlme is similar to lm but is meant for models
without random effects.

      The 'weights' argument on 'lm' is assumed to identify a vector of
the same length as the response, giving numbers that are inversely
proportional to the variance for each observation.

      However, 'lm' provides no capability to estimate weights.  If you
want to do that, the varFunc capabilities in the 'nlme' package is the
best tool I know for that purpose.

      If someone thinks there are better tools available for estimating
heterscedasticity, I hope s/he will enlighten us both.

      Hope this helps.
