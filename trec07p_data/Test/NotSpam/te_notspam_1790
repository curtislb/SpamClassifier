This date is NOT arbitrary. It is AFTER this clause was first discussed.

There are two reasons for this. Firstly, many jurisdictions implicitly 
or explicitly forbid retro-activeness. Without this date, there's a good 
chance the clause would be declared legally invalid.

It isn't meant to protect recipients. It's intended to stop 
distributors.

If you are a party to a "discriminatory" agreement, YOU are liable to 
protect downstream, or YOU CAN'T DISTRIBUTE. THAT is the point of that 
clause - if you want to distribute, you have the responsibility to make 
sure downstream can distribute too. You can't negotiate protection for 
yourself (or your customers) and leave everybody else at risk.

Patents are a risk factor for Americans. This clause just says you have 
to share the risk equally, if a distributor negotiates unequal 
protection then it's a violation of v3.

Cheers,
Wol
