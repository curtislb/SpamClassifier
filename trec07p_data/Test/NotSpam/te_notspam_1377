It certainly addresses the problem. Let's look at the two possibilities:

Before:
   GPL (either explicitly or implicitly): you can do X
   Restriction: you can't do X

Result - conflict and confusion; non-redistributable code

After:
   GPL (either explicitly or implicitly): you can do X
   GPL: If I say you can't do X, you can ignore me
   Restriction: you can't do X

Result - the license is consistent, although it has one part which 
nullifies another part. This is similar to clauses of the form "The 
previous part of this clause does not apply if you are wearing blue 
underwear".

If you (in your example) license under GPLv3 + restriction, then by 
picking GPLv3 you are giving me, the recipient of the code, permission 
to remove the restriction. If you didn't want to give me that 
permission, you shouldn't have used GPLv3 - just as if you didn't want 
to give me permission to link my code with the Affero GPL (to take one 
example of many), you shouldn't have used GPLv3.
