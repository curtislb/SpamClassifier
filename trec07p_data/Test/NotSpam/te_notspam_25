Here are few points I've seen using git -

git-core is really low level. It is not advised for most newbies to
use git as is. Instead advisable to try cogito which is "version
control system layered on top of the git tree history
storage system"

Now comparing different dvcs -

Here's a (and partly uninformed) comparison  of different dvcs on
their various flaws and features -
http://changelog.complete.org/posts/528-Whose-Distributed-VCS-Is-The-Most-Distributed.html

And all that you needed to know about scm ( discussion to death ) -
http://versioncontrolblog.com/category/scm-tools-comparison/

Its interesting to note the comments from the Mozilla project on their
choice of version control.

But common to all of them - bzr is featureful but slow currently.

Coming to my personal tastes -
1. git really shines in cherry picking and multiway merge.
2. More importantly it supports both push and pull.
3. Personally I like git because of of its speed and size and the huge
push it receives because of its use by the kernel guys.
