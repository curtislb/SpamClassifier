Hiya,
    Well, I'm mostly wondering about how Yum works, and a lot of that basic 
kind of package management stuff.  The problem is that the server I have 
access to is probably customized in some way, so I need to figure out how it 
does things.  I'm afraid of breaking it and needing to call in the tech 
support folks to fix it.
To quote them, they say that only advanced users need to access the machine 
via SSH.
Thanks,
Zack.
