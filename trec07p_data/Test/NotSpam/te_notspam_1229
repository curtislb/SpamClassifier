I wish it could, but I am afraid it cannot...  :-(

If the work, as you received it, has *no* interactive interfaces, the
exception granted with the "however" sentence does *not* apply.
As a consequence, *any* interactive interface you add to a
non-interactive work *must* display Appropriate Legal Notices.

Unfortunately, I don't think this interpretation is correct.
In the context of section 5 (and of other sections too), the "Program"
refers to the GPLv3'd work, as you received it, while the "work [based
on the Program]" is the modified version of the work that you produced
by modifying the Program.

Let me quote the relevant part of section 5:

|   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
|=20
|   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to

I have tried to convince the FSF to drop clause 5d or, at least, to
relax it so that it only required what you have just said:

http://gplv3.fsf.org/comments/rt/summarydecision.html?filename=3D%3C%%20%20=

but, unfortunately, I failed.   :-(
