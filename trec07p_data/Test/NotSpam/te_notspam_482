The poll includes both, but as you note, some of the options only
seem to cover the word at present.  Whether we should develop them to
also cover the logos is an interesting question for later, but not
really about the general approach.

Yes, it was intentionally left out.  It seemed to be discussing
ProposedTrademarkPolicy, which is an option on the poll.

Sorry, I'm lagging.  Now I've decided that some are deliberately
trying to snow me under by trying to make me do me pointless tasks,
I'm firewalling them, so things will improve.

Open to all.  I think this affects all contributors, whether DD or
not, commercial or not.

Hope that clarifies,
