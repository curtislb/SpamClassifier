Yeah, totally my reaction as well.

The "GPL version 2 or later" case is even more interesting. 8-)

Not to the general public, no.

If you the license requires to publish the source code, other
provisions in the license apply.

This is quite bizarre.  It might mean that you could implement a
workaround for the patent, or distribute it in a jurisdiction where
the patent does not apply or something like that.  What does the
rationale say about this?

But version 3 doesn't allow this, does it?
