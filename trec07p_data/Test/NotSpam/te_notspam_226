I never said anything of the sort.

Well, sort of, yeah. Pointing out problems is one thing. Complaining is
another. And telling other people what they should do to solve your problems
is yet another thing entirely.

But anyway, my main point was to suggest that people ask themselves what
they've contributed to the open source community. Even if you're not a
coder, you can write documentation, maintain a web site, etc.
