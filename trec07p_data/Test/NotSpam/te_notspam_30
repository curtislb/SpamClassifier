[0]frankShook writes "The Canadian news service CBC has up an article
entitled 'Linux distributors scorn Microsoft partnership'. Primarily, it
looks to describe the ongoing licensing saga between Microsoft and Linux
distributors. It also includes [1]a highly unique interpretation of the
GPL: 'Open-source software such as Linux, on the other hand, encourages
individuals to add to or modify software without fear of legal
repercussions, so long as they abide by the conditions of the general
public license, which stipulates that the program must remain open and
sharable.'"

twitter writes with a link to a ZDNet blog entry about a piece of
legislation submitted to the California state senate. Drafted by
Democratic Senator Joe Simitian, its purpose is to ensure that employers
cannot require the implantation of RFID chips as part of employment. It
is meeting with scorn from the American Electronics Association. "'Our
bottom line is we're opposed to anything that demonizes RFIDs,' she said.
'The technology has been in existence for more than 50 years. It's in
more than 1.2 billion ID credentials worldwide. ... We've not seen a
single showing of ID theft or harm,' said Roxanne Gould, vice president
for California government relations for the American Electronics
Association, a high-tech industry group."

speed as the Core 2 Duo E6700 at 2.66GHz, this new processor also runs on
a faster 1,333MHz Front Side Bus. The new chip's additional bus bandwidth
affords it up to a 5% performance advantage over standard 1066MHz

News.com reports that despite earlier rumblings that addiction to
videogames [0]could be classified a mental disorder similar to
alcoholism, experts have stepped back from that analysis. The decision by
the AMA is that psychiatrists should make further efforts to study the
phenomenon, while addiction experts [1]strongly opposed the idea at the
organization's annual meeting. "Even before debate on the subject began,
the committee that made the proposal backed away from its position, and
instead recommended that the American Psychiatric Association consider
the change when it revises its next diagnostic manual in 5 years. The
psychiatrist group has said if the science warrants, it could be
considered for inclusion in the next diagnostic manual, which will be
published in 2012. While occasional use of video games is harmless and
may even help with some disorders like autism, doctors said in extreme
cases it can interfere with day-to-day necessities like working,
showering or even eating."

3 mouse that's touted to be the world's most health conscious, ergonomics
friendly mouse in the world. And it's vertical, too, instead of
horizontal. The review states, "Unlike other mice, Evoluent's
VerticalMouse 3 stands vertical to locate your hand in a handshake
position, or where the arm is in 90-degrees form from the tabletop. It
even has a small lip at the bottom to prevent your little finger from
touching the desk. According to the company, this is the most natural
position for the hand to be in and it reduces a magnitude of stress from
your hand, wrist and arm. Apparently traditional mice with horizontal
statures twist your lower arm and put unnecessary stress on its vital
areas. We must admit that getting used to the mouse didn't take too long,
even though it was slightly awkward to get used to in the beginning.
After all, old habits die hard."

libraries have embraced technology. But speakers said that there was a
larger split between students -- who are "digital natives," in one
popular way of classifying people based on their experience with
technology -- and librarians, who are more likely to be "digital
immigrants." They may have learned the language, but it's a second
language.'"

[0]coondoggie writes to tell us that top among feature requests for any
next-gen communications system among federal network managers is the
ability to [1]identify and notify employees in real time. "Federal
interest in presence technologies 'may come from the fact that agencies
want to know where their workforce is to be able to look at the
effectiveness and the efficiency of what they're able to do,' says Aaron
Heffron, vice president of Market Connections. 'They want to be in
contact with them at all times.'"

[0]Van Cutter Romney sends us word of a [1]British steam-powered car that
will attempt to set a world record speed of 200 mph. The car, constructed
on a tubular chassis, holds four boilers that deliver four megawatts of
power, producing 300 bhp. The current record of 127.659 mph was
established in 1906. [2]More photos and specs at the Steam Car Club of
Great Britain's site.
