Looking at Slackware-current, which is to become Slackware 12.0, it will 
include 2.6.21.5 with the usual speakup.s kernel.  The major differences 
are that they are finally dropping 2.4 kernels, and also dropping support 
for boot floppies simply because Pat couldn't get a 2.6 kernel to fit on a 
floppy disk.
