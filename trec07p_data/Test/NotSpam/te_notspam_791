Perhaps a better approach is to squirrel away an MD5 of the source file 
last time it was checked (or remembers all MD5s of all good source 
files, irrespective of whether they actually exist in the repository as 
latest versions -- that would help with the Git issues). Of course, this 
would mean checking in a generated file; but perhaps that could be done 
by a robot that sweeps the tree once a day or so.

An alternative to checking in the MD5 list would be to use a queryable 
server; but some people work offline or have high-latency links, so 
perhaps that doesn't work so well.
