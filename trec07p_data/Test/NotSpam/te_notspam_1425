There's nothing about the earliest giving user more choice than the
latest.  If instead of GPL 2 and GPL 3, we call them GPL Foo and GPL Bar,
we get:

  - Program is licensed under either GPL Foo, GPL Bar, or future versions
  that don't exist yet.
  - Since both Foo and Bar are DFSG-free [1], we are allowed to distribute it
  under the terms of either.  This doesn't take away freedom from our users,
  who are still able to use it as per the terms of Foo or Bar.

AISI, the reason for using the unversioned link is that it means less work
for maintainers (and the work *is* significant when it comes to lots of
packages) who have to update the copyright file every time license changes.
Most GPL programs out there are 2-or-later, so we are always allowed to
distributed as per the latest GPL.  The opposite does not apply.

[1] Even if DFSG-freeness of GPL 3 were to be disputed, this proposal is
    completely agnostic about that.
