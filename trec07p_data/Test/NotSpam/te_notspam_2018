Agreed, and this should be fixed.  I'm just worried that this is
working around a symptom, rather than the actual bug (which is that the
regexdna.pir shooutout test has changed behavior, and begun passing a
NULL pointer).

I tried various workarounds... calling string_substr() from
substr_s_i_i_s if rep was null, passing to string_substr() from within
string_replace() if rep was null, that kind of thing.  The shootout
test runs to completion, but still fails: the last line of output had
some differing digits.  (Apparently some string was supposed to be
replaced, and just returning a substr without replacing anything isn't
sufficient.)

So, while I agree that the "crashing on NULL rep" bug needs to be fixed,
I've been mostly focusing on staring at regexdna.pir, hoping to find a
fix for the "passing a NULL rep in the first place" bug.
