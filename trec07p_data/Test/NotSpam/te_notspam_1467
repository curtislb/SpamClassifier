Seatec:

Start here:

  http://ubiqx.org/cifs/SMB.html#SMB.8

That should get you most of the way from the old LM hash through NTLM, LMv2,
and NTLMv2.

Once you've covered that, you may want to look at:

  http://www.microsoft.com/technet/technetmag/issues/2006/08/SecurityWatch/
and
  http://davenport.sourceforge.net/ntlm.html
and, of course, Wikipedia.

The basic problem is that authentication is a moving target.  Microsoft,
quite reasonably, has to keep introducing stronger authentication methods
and defaulting to stricter requirements.  Newer systems may, for instance,
require Kerberos authentication.

I hope that helps.
