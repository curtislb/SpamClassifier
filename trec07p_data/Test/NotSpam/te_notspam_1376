Are you familiar enough with the laws of Italy (where Francesco appears 
to reside) to state that there are such laws which apply to him?

How are you defining "legal advice"? If it is "advice on matters which 
may relate to the law", then that could be taken to be anything. It's a 
definition so broad as to be useless.

So if the speaker in your "Bob" example is in one of these 
jurisdictions, saying what he said is technically illegal? Do you not 
think that this makes the law an ass?

Why? I've never seen that happen (although I've only been on the list 
for a year or two). It's certainly not a regular occurrence.

Does this line of argument mean that when I watch "Boston Legal", and 
decide to follow the advice some of those (fictional) lawyers gave their 
clients, I can sue the program when it all goes wrong, because the word 
"Legal" in the name gave me a reasonable expectation that they were 
providing "legal advice"?
