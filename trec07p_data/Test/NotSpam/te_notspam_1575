This seems an unfairly perjorative way of saying "the list of rights the 
user acquires with the software". This clause is not about making the 
GNU Manifesto (or even a copy of the GPL) pop up every time you start an 
application. No text is mandated.

Except that the GPL also allows you to do Q, but requires you to do R if 
you do so, both of which are not mentioned in the DFSG.

Not to mention the fact that many Debian or Debian-derived distribution 
users (e.g. Ubuntu) may never have heard of the DFSG but use the 
software. I think it's reasonable for the software they use to tell them 
what rights they have to it.

Again, the clause does not say that the user must be forced to be 
presented with the information.

I don't think so. For someone who uses command-line software, a 
command-line switch like --version or --help is the equivalent of Help | 
About.

Except that copyleft is entirely built on the legal system.

And that's an important extra guarantee and obligation that the user 
needs to know about.

So the notice "You may play ball games in this park" destroys the 
freedom to play ball games in the park?

Yep. Why is this worse than the GUI or command-line versions? You could 
argue that the command could be accidentally invoked, but that's true of 
buttons in GUIs or mistakenly typing -V instead of -v on a command-line 
app. Just pick a sequence of movements that it's very difficult to do 
without meaning it.
