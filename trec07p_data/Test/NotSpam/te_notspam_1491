Yes, you have. Note that this is not the situation we have been 
considering up to now in this thread; the situation we have been 
considering is one where there is just a simple additional restriction 
(e.g. "if you redistribute you must send me a postcard").

Your above restriction also results in a consistent license. However, 
it's not GPLv3-compatible.

Clearly, your explicit statement that section 7 does not apply. How 
could one argue otherwise?

Because most of the time, people just add additional restrictions 
without also adding your language about section 7 - often because they 
don't realise they can't do that. This feature of the license combats 
cluelessness, not explicit intent.
