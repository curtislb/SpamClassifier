Beg tour pardon? Are we talking about the silly name "associative 
array" sometimes used form hashes? Or are you trying to say that 
hashes are stored behind the scenes the same way arrays are?

It's true that you can coerce a hash to a list and you can assign 
that list to an array, 

  @array = %hash;

but that does NOT mean that a hash is actually an array. It can be 
kinda converted to one, but since the order is unspecified, I don't 
think it'd make any good when the task at hand is comparing two 
hashes.
