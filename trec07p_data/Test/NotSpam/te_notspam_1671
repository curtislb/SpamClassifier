Well, the GPLv3 text itself is licensed under the terms "Everyone is
permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document,
but changing it is not allowed.", so if your license is going to include
the rest of the GPL, it's going to include the bit that says ignoring
restrictions is okay.

So I'd say that is, in fact, the best you can hope for -- and if you've
made the licensing terms fairly deliberately ambiguous, I wouldn't bet on
you being able to enforce your "can't link with AGPLv3" requirement, even
if I wouldn't bet on you not being able to enforce it. I'd be reluctant
to accept something that deliberately ambiguous into the archive, even
though either outcome was DFSG-free.

Presumably the idea is to discourage licensing proliferation by making
it hard to extend the GPL in incompatible ways -- perhaps not impossible,
but definitely harder than it would be without that clause.

Cheers,
