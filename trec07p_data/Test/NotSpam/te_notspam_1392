You are amazing Sean.  You do not state "IANAL" and therefore we conclude
that you are "certified" to practice law in every jurisdiction in which
debian-legal is read ... or did you think Italian law permits a foreign
attorney to provide legal advice by email concerning Italian law to an
Italian citizen in Italy?  Guess you're going to have to plan vacations
kind of carefully to avoid all those countries where you're now a felon.
As an officer of the court, you will be promptly confessing your crimes
to your state bar association, right?

Personally, IANAL.  I don't give legal advice.  I argue law all I want.
