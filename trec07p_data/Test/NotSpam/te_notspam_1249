It could, but I don't think this is one we can test in many cases.

If GPLv3 does turn out to have bizarre interactions with Computer Misuse
law, then either FSF will amend (I hope) or GPLv3 will surely be rejected
en masse.  Until then, I'm willing to assume it does what was intended
and not hold it as a problem following the DFSG.

Are you sure?  If the work has no interactive user interfaces, neither
of the above 'if' parts seem true already, so adding the first such
interface lets its author make both parts true simultaneously by adding an
interface which does not display the notices, if they so wish.

I share these reservations.  A problem to watch for in GPLv3 packages.

Not destruction, but it means GPLv3 is only a weak copyleft IMO.  It is
amazing that GPLv3 may give a minor exit route from free software to
adware.  The only way to avoid it is for FSF to never release GAGPL, but
how likely is FSF to change course now?  They've marginalised several
good web app authors from the consultations by putting it in a bad
Web-2.Null interface, so I'm fearful it's a done deal.
