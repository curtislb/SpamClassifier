Well, Section 2 of GPLv3 states, in part:

| This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the
| unmodified Program.

This can be a legal no-op in many jurisdictions where copyright does not
cover use, but not necessarily everywhere.

But anyway, there's not only copyright, there are software patents too
(and I should add "unfortunately").
Section 11 states, in part:

|   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
| patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
| make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
| propagate the contents of its contributor version.

In jurisdictions where some contributor's essential patents are valid
and enforceable (and actively enforced) you need to accept the GNU GPL
v3 even for the sole purpose of using or running the program.

I already kinda agreed with MJ Ray on this point: see
http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2007/06/msg00279.html

I waive my right to sue for copyright infringement, when I license a
work under the GNU GPL v2?
That's new to me.
How can the copyleft mechanism be effective, if I cannot sue people who
do not comply with the license?!?

The requirement to provide source code of (redistributed) modified
versions is not waiving legal rights.
Which right *that I would enjoy by not accepting the license* am I
waiving?
The right to distribute modified versions without providing source?
I do not have such a right, unless I get permission from the copyright
holder of the unmodified work.  Accepting the license is the way to get
that permission.
