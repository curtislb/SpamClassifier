Hi Randal,
While the books are great - I saw this great idea over at the Python
community. Someone came up with a list of ten small programs in
python, each introducing a core part of the language. This was added
to the wiki over at - http://wiki.python.org/moin/SimplePrograms . It
now contains programs in incresing no. of lines of code.

That's a great way to quickly get up to speed on the feel and ways of
a language. Please do take a look and something like this for Perl
would be brilliant! :)
Since, I'm still getting to know the ropes, i thought i'd drop in this
request.

Ciao and thx
Alex
