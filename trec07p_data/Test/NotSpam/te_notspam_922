I went through a pam install from source on slackware recently
because the new free vmware server will not work without it.
It was annoying to get working initially because the pam config
provided by vmware was not compatible with the pam built 
from source. Apparently most distros have pam but slack does
not. Not sure how much it complicates thing altogether but for
getting vmware working, once it was configured properly it 
was not a problem at all for me. PAM is an authentication 
system, so yes it does complicate authentication. Vmware 
uses it for authenticating access to those vmware processes
over that funky local network it creates. More info on pam
here

I don't know much about gnome because I've been very 
interested in it.

 I've heard some technical complaints about Dropline.  One of those 
seems to be that it installs PAM, which isn't really something I'm 
familiar with.  From what I gather, it complicates traditional ways of 
doing things considerably.
