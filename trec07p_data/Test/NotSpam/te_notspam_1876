The following shuffles up my deck of card and then prints out the top
five cards. I need it to work somehwhat differently.

When I shift or pop an element, I need to
store it as a variable, then push it on to the array in a different
order from the original order. Any suggestions? (See code below)*

#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;


my @startingdeck = ("A H","2 H","3 H","4 H","5 H","6 H","7 H","8 H",
                "9 H","10 H","J H","Q H","K H",
                "A D","2 D","3 D","4 D","5 D","6 D","7 D","8 D",
                "9 D","10 D","J D","Q D","K D",
                "A C","2 C","3 C","4 C","5 C","6 C","7 C","8 C",
                "9 C","10 C","J C","Q C","K C",
                "A S","2 S","3 S","4 S","5 S","6 S","7 S","8 S",
                "9 S","10 S","J S","Q S","K S");

for my $x (0 .. 99) {
       my @shuffle = (
               shift(@startingdeck),
               shift(@startingdeck),
               pop(@startingdeck),
               pop(@startingdeck)
       );

       push @startingdeck, @shuffle;
}
print "@startingdeck[0 .. 4]\n";
