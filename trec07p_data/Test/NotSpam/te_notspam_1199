Subject: Test::Class fixture problem
To: beginners@perl.org, Adrian Howard <adrianh@quietstars.com>

I've just spent quite a bit of time debugging a problem where a Test::Class setup method was misbehaving.  My tests passed, but mysql was spitting out errors directly to STDERR and quite a bit of tracing led me to the following:

  sub setup : Tests(setup) {
      my $test = shift;
      $test->SUPER::startup;
      $test->_make_test_servers(
          num_servers => 2,
          username    => 'Ovid',
      );
  }

As you can see, I called SUPER::startup instead of SUPER::setup.

My base class has stubs for these methods to ensure that I never have a problem with SUPER::

  sub startup : Tests(startup) {}
  sub setup : Tests(setup) {}

  sub teardown : Tests(teardown) {}

  sub shutdown : Tests(shutdown) {}


Sometimes in my hierarchy, though, the SUPER::startup (or whatever) method will call a chain of two of these before getting to the stub.  It's trivial to write code in my stubs which check the caller and issue a warning and maybe I can just walk back through the call stack to issue a warning if I'm ever called by an inappropriately named method, but that seems a bit hackish.  Is there some better way to solve this problem?

Cheers,
Ovid
