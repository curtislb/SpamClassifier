A client with extremely high load on their Samba server is  
intermittently hitting this code in smbd/sesssetup.c:

if (!global_ntlmssp_state) {
		/* auth before negotiatiate? */
		return ERROR_NT(NT_STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER);
	}


This is 3.0.11 - apparently he tried this on a later version with  
minimal problems (unfortunately, we have not as yet released a  
"newer" version of Samba on our product :( ) - does anyone know if  
this was an issue that was specifically fixed?  I didn't see anything  
obvious in bugzilla.samba.org.

There is a literal ton of NTLMSSP traffic against this server, and in  
many cases different auth contexts are interleaved in the wire - it  
seems that the errors I'm seeing in the sniff occur when these  
messages get intertwined.

Given that, and the presence of a "global" static struct  
auth_ntlmssp_state *global_ntlmssp_state, I suspect this was fixed by  
revision 8472 2 years ago (dang - we are dangerously out of date here).

Andrew / Jerry - Can you confirm?  I could not find anything related  
to parallel NTLM processing in bugzilla...
