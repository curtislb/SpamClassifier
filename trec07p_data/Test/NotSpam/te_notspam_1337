Well to run yum you have the following syntax:

yum install package
yum remove package
yum update package
Now in Fedora we have what they call:
what provides
this tells you what a package depends on:

So for an example the statement might look like this:

yum whatprovides perl
or the name of the package.

Do you need to know how to install rpm's?
