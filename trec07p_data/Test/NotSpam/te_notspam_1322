I don't think this clause says anything non-free (indeed, it seems to be
weaker than the existing clause in GPLv2), but wow, if it isn't hard to
read.  I guess there's something in the GPLv3 to please everyone, including
lawyers. >:)

Huh, nicely done.  I don't see any reason that this should be considered
non-free, though I expect there'll be some debate about it on -legal.

Each of these appears to be a license term that we have accepted as free
before, so there doesn't seem to be any reason to think that the
DFSG-compliance of the GPLv3 is variable.

WTF, seriously?  Reading this makes me want to go write some new code,
license it under the GPLv3 with some random and arbitrary prohibition, and
watch someone at the FSF try to argue that the additional restriction has no
legal force.

Not non-free, just incredibly goofy; I understand the motivation, I just
don't see how anyone would actually think this would address the problem.

Right, here we start getting into the murky world of patents.  This part
says that as a condition of accepting the license on a work, you may not
assert patent rights over the work. Ok, that doesn't seem different from
GPLv2 to me.  (Hmm, I think I need to go back and look at the APSL again, to
understand how it's different from GPLv2/v3.)

This says that anyone licensing code under the GPLv3 is implicitly granting
a license to any patents they hold which affect the use of the work,
*without* requiring the licensor to give up enforcement of unrelated
patents that someone might later infringe by modifying the work.  Ok.

Here I'm confused again.  What does making the source code available have to
do with patents?  Isn't it the case that the license already requires source
code availability?  How does making the source code available help the
patent problem?

Is the meaning here that the Corresponding Source is only "available" if
there are no patents applying to it?  That's the only sensible meaning I can
extract, but the license seems to go about saying this in a rather obtuse
way.

What does (2) really mean?  How can one "arrange to deprive [oneself] of the
benefit of the patent license" -- by goading the licensor into suing you? :)
Otherwise, even if the patent license agreement is terminated on paper, how
do you force the patent holder to still treat everyone "fairly"?

But, ok; in spite of the above doubts, they've done a pretty good job of
closing the patent loophole, and done so in a way that I think is DFSG-ok.

Huh, is this anti-discrimination clause discriminatory against
people/companies who were late to the patent game? :)

Of everything in this license, this is the one paragraph I'm least certain
about in terms of DFSG-compatibility.  On the one hand, it prevents
licensees from being able to buy patent protection on behalf of their
customers, which is in many respects a useful service for vendors to be able
to provide; on the other hand it prevents certain noteworthy software
vendors from using their patent portfolios strategically against the Linux
community in ways that are detrimental to Free Software as a whole.

And on the gripping hand, there's this rather unfair exception for patent
licensees who got in on the game early.

I guess I don't see that either side of this argument is overwhelmingly
compelling; so I expect that this will be disputed, but accepted by the
ftpmasters.

Hmm, so maybe when I license my software with an extra restriction, this is
what I'll restrict. ;)

I'm no fan of Affero, but permitting linking with it is certainly not a DFSG
issue.


So all in all, not bad; I'm actually quite pleased with it given what I
remember of some of the earlier drafts that were floated.  Not only do I
think it's free, I think it's a license that I'd be willing to consider for
my own code.
