How would you launch the second instance if the factory does not  
provide a dbus service? That's why it's called a factory, after all.

Also, please keep in mind that whatever protocol changes you  
introduce cannot be fixed up solely by adapting the default activity  
code in Sugar. There are native activities implementing the raw DBus  
protocol, too. One example is Etoys (not sure if there are more at  
this time). So please notify activity developers in advance to give  
us a little bit of time to adapt to protocol changes.
