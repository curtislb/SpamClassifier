Hmm, that's not a universally held opinion within Debian.  I don't know if I
would consider a modified GPL that only offered the 3b option to be free; I
suspect I would not.  So even though GPL itself is free, that doesn't mean
that any element of the GPL taken alone is also free.

And it wasn't my point to try to claim that 3b was free, my point was about
whether quantitative differences should impact our decisions about the
freeness of two otherwise identical licenses.  Apparently I should have
picked a better example.
