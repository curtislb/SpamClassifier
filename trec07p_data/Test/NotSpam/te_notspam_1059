Well, the first and third are using timeSeries which is not in R, and more 
to the point there is no support for irregular time series in R itself.
But they seem nothing to do with alignment!

The first is easy by indexing

x.align <- ts(NA_real_, start=1, end=14)
x.align[c(1,2,5,8,9,12,14)] <- c(0.5,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.3,0.2,0.3)

The second and third you can do via approx:

x <- ts(1:10, frequency = 4)
x.align <- ts(approx(unclass(x), xout=seq(1, 10, 0.5))$y, frequency = 8)

pos <- c(1,2.5,3.2,4.1,5.7,6.5,7.3)
x <- c(0.5,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.3,0.2,0.3)
ts(approx(pos, x, 1:7)$y)

I suspect the first can also be done via package 'zoo', which is the sort 
of place I would expect to find this functionality.
