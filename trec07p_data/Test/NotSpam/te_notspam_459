<br>
We devote the whole of tonight's programme to the handover of Prime Ministe=
rial power.
<br>

<br>
David Grossman was on the front row of the Commons press gallery for Tony B=
lair's last Prime Minister's Questions. He witnessed an unprecedented sendi=
ng off by Blair's fellow Parliamentarians. Combat suspended - for a while a=
t least - the former PM received warm tributes, a standing ovation, as well=
 as many good hearted pats on the back, he even threw in some good jokes. D=
avid brings us the definitive account of the final hours of Blair's premier=
ship.=20
<br>

<br>
"Let the work of change begin".
<br>

<br>
Michael Crick started his day at the Treasury and has been watching the equ=
ally compelling journey of Zombie Brown's path to Number 10. He'll have the=
 latest news on any reshuffle announcements.
<br>

<br>
Jeremy will be interviewing top figures from all the three parties as well =
as Quentin Letts, Andrew Rawnsley and Jackie Ashley.=20
<br>

<br>
We also reveal the winner of the Order of the Brown Nose.
<br>

<br>
Do add your thoughts on what should be on Tony Blair's political epitaph.=
