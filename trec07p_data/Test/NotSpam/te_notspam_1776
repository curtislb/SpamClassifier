To all ...,

Bill's "lateral" wisdom is almost certainly a better solution.  So thanks
for the advice (and everything else that went before it [Bill: apropos of
termplot, what happened to tplot ?]).  And I will [almost] desist from
asking the obvious: and if there were 10 000 observations ?

BestR,
Mark.
