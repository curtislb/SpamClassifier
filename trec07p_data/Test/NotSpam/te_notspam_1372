Hi, 

I have bought this notebook about a week ago and it has vista home premium 
pre-installed. I am planning on installing debian testing on it as well. 

I have read in various articles and posts that there are many issues 
regarding hibernation and other power saving issues with almost all the 
distros out there. I will really appreciate if anyone may have suggestions 
regarding notebook installations, tips and troubleshooting that could be of 
value. 


Below are the specs of my Toshiba notebook: 

CPU: Core2 Duo T722 2GZ
RAM: 2GB
Disk: 160GB
Video Card: Nvidia Gforce 7300 (256mb dedicated)
An unknown webcam
An integrated wireless and wired ethernet cards
A modem 

Thank you...
