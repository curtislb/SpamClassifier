Hi all,

Any help on this would be appreciated :)

Currently I have a perl program thats required to call another perl
program. The second one takes arguments and can be called as:

            perl vplan_all.pl 5.6 24.0 ajtest

Here 5.6, 24.0 and ajtest are all command line options.

I have to call this from a second program that i wrote. I tried the
call as below -

          system( "perl vplan_all.pl 5.6 24.0")
            or die "Couldn't run the vplan_all.pl script: $!\n";

However, this doesn't seem to work. The shell reports that perl can't
find the file. However, when i simply try with -

          system( "perl vplan_all.pl")
            or die "Couldn't run the vplan_all.pl script: $!\n";

The script is now called and i get the result -

          vp_all: USAGE: perl vplan_all.pl <Version> <Build>
<File_name_to_be_created>

which is the expected behaviour when no options are provided.
So apparently the shell calls perl and passes the entire "perl
vplan_all.pl 5.6 24.0" as a chunk. Perl can't then seem to
differentiate between the code name and the options.

I've tried bypassing the shell [ system(xxx,xxx,xx)] but that doesn't
seem to help.

Please do point out any ideas on this one.
Thx in advance!
Alex Jamestin
