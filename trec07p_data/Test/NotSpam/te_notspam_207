No, I don't think it is. People with Windows already have a SMB
server. Also, git does work on Windows, it just can't be as fast as it
is on Linux.

That's odd, I recall my just-Samba 4 import into bzr was around 200 Mb
last I tried (but that's a while ago now).

Right. Shared repositories are just a storage optimization. They're
not a UI thing (yet). I've heard people talking about allowing you to
push repositories and all the branches in them at once, but haven't
seen any actual implementations.

Bazaar is working on getting better performance, it's just not there
yet. It will work with large trees in the future, just not yet. I also
don't think we should adopt it (even by truncating history) until it
can handle the larger histories.

Agreed.
