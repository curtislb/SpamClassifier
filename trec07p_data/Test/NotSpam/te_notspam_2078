Hello!

This is not Debian related, but I think you are the ones who know best abou=
t=20
licensing issues.

In 2004 the sourcecode to Jagged Alliance 2 was released:=20
http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=3D04/03/16/0343250

It comes with a license which I have a hard time to fully understand:
http://games.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=3D100591&cid=3D8577084

My specific questions follow, but if someone would explain the license in m=
ore=20
detail I would be happy, too.

=2D Is it GPL or LGPL compatible? Or compatible to any other common FOSS=20
license?

=2D =C2=A71 is what the GPL requires, too, correct?

=2D =C2=A72: Binary format means anything that is not text? Incl. images, s=
oundfiles=20
and the like? Does "reverse engineer" include reproduction? (As would=20
be "rewriting" to sourcecode.)

=2D Do =C2=A73+5 mean that I can distribute the code incl. my modifications=
 under a=20
=46OSS license (GPL eg.)? (I don't know it, but it feels that the GPL is mo=
re=20
restrictive (=C2=A73) and still grants them the rights they want (=C2=A75).)
Would it be ok to add an exception for Strategy First, to match the "withou=
t=20
any limitations" part?

=2D Does =C2=A74 mean that I have to ship a detailed and full changelog wit=
h the=20
application? Or with the sourcecode? Or does every single file need a=20
changelog? What happens if I create new files? Or copy contents of existing=
=20
files into new ones?

=2D =C2=A78+9 are standard clauses also present in the GPL, right?

=2D Is =C2=A710 similar to the patent restrictions in the GPLv3?

=2D Does =C2=A711 mean that any rights given to me by this license may not =
apply to=20
derivate works???

=2D Which rights I might assume I have are reserved by =C2=A714?

Thanks in advance,
Dennis
