[0]xnuandax writes "The army's explanation of weather balloons in the
[1]Roswell, New Mexico incident 60 years ago has been dealt a serious
public relations blow. Late Army Lt. [2]Walter Haut had signed a sealed
affidavit prior to his death last year asserting that he had [3]witnessed
the wreckage of an egg-shaped craft and its extraterrestrial crew while
working at the Roswell Army Air Field. An article at News.com.au reviews
how Haut had worked as public relations officer for the Roswell base and
was involved in the original weather balloon explanation of events at the
time. This recent evidence would seem to confirm speculation that
egg-shaped saucers are notoriously difficult to fly safely at low
altitude."

makes 3D objects solid enough to grasp. The system, created by engineers
at Japan's NTT, combines a 3D display with a haptic glove, making 3D
items that look real but also feel solid to touch. Two cameras are used
to image an object, to make the 3D image. A computer also uses this to
render a solid representation. It could be used to inspect products
remotely, or even to shake hands with someone on the other side of the
world, the researchers say."

I'm not putting a new chip into my iPhone in the slot on the left side of
my phone when no slot there exists. PR Blogger Steve Rubel has also
[2]been documenting his problems on his Twitterstream. According to an
unscientific poll being conducted by Engadget [3]about half of the people
who bought iPhones have had activation trouble with about 38% of problems
still unresolved." Even [4]the folks at MacWorld weren't immune to these

putting products prominently in a movie or TV show, fake goods move from
the screen to reality ... Customers have been looking at Squishees and
KrustyO's and Buzz Cola for years and have never been able to put their

[0]Bert de Jong writes "The Daily Mail reports that thousands of rubber
ducks who have traveled the seas of the world since 1992 [1]are about to
end their journey. After escaping out of a container fallen off a Chinese
freight ship in a storm, scientists have been followed them on their
fifteen year trek. This has turned out to be an invaluable source of
information for studying ocean currents. Now it seems inevitable though
that they will finally land on the shores of South-West England.
'[Oceanographer Curtis Ebbesmeyer] correctly predicted what many thought
was impossible - that thousands of them would end up washed into the
Arctic ice near Alaska, and then move at a mile a day, frozen in the pack
ice, around their very own North-West Passage to the Atlantic. It proved
true years later and in 2003, the first Friendly Floatees were found,
frozen and then thawed out, on the eastern seaboard of the U.S. and
Canada. So precious to science are they that the US firm that made them
is offering a Â£50 bounty for finding one.'"

'per channel/per station.' The Digital Music Association responded
immediately in its own press release that [3]it would agree to this, but
only if the term for the new arrangement were extended to 2010 â or,
preferably, forever. On another front, SoundExchange seems aware in its
PR that it will have to concede something more to the non-profit

may include Universal pulling its entire catalog from iTunes. Both sides
stand to lose out with 1/3 of of new releases coming from Universal and
an estimated 15% of Universal's sales coming from digital downloads.
Apple's market share is about 75% of digital downloads, and digital

the RFID technology behind many of the up and coming "contactless payment
systems" is robust enough to [1]prevent account fraud and the theft of
personal information. "Concerns over the security of contactless systems
were heightened last week by a Federal Reserve decision that will allow
for even more casual, low-cost purchases to be made across the country.
In recent years, credit card companies have waived their signature
requirements for so-called "small ticket" items in order to get a slice
of the action. Visa, for instance, doesn't require your signature for
purchases at or below $25."

Physicists at the University of North Carolina have developed new
[0]improvements for high-energy-density capacitors that can store up to
seven times as much energy per unity volume as common capacitors. "The
amount of energy that a capacitor can store depends on the insulating
material in between the metal surfaces, called a dielectric. A polymer
called PVDF has interested physicists as a possible high-performance
dielectric. It exists in two forms, polarized or unpolarized. In either
case, its structure is mostly frozen-in and changes only slightly when a
capacitor is charged up. Mixing a second polymer called CTFE with PVDF
results in a material with regions that can change their structure,
enabling it to store and release unprecedented amounts of energy."

studguy1 writes to tell us TorrentFreak is reporting that the Russian
government has [0]shut down Allofmp3, the popular online music site.
"AllOfMP3 has been a thorn in the side of the RIAA and the US government
for years. Last year, U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab said that if
Russia wants to join the WTO, they should shut down the pirate music
website that is robbing US recording companies of sales."

An anonymous reader notes that President Bush has decided to [0]commute
Scooter Libby's sentence after numerous appeals failed. Libby was
convicted in March of obstruction of justice in connection with the
Valerie Plame affair. The President's action spares Libby from 30 months
behind bars."
