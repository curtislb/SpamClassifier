I've rolled up R-2.5.1.tar.gz a short while ago. This is a maintenancerelease and fixes a number of mostly minor bugs and platform issues. See the full list of changes below.
You can get it (in a short while) from
http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-2/R-2.5.1.tar.gz
or wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you. Binariesfor various platforms will appear in due course.         For the R Core Team

Here is the relevant bit of the NEWS file:
                CHANGES IN R VERSION 2.5.1
NEW FEATURES
    o   density(1:20, bw = "SJ") now works as bw.SJ() now tries a larger        search interval than the default (lower, upper) if it does not        find a solution within the latter.
    o   The output of library() (no arguments) is now sorted by library        trees in the order of .libPaths() and not alphabetically.
    o   R_LIBS_USER and R_LIBS_SITE feature possible expansion of        specifiers for R version specific information as part of the        startup process.
    o   C-level warning calls now print a more informative context,        as C-level errors have for a while.
    o   There is a new option "rl_word_breaks" to control the way the        input line is tokenized in the readline-based terminal        interface for object- and file-name completion.        This allows it to be tuned for people who use their space bar        vs those who do not.  The default now allows filename-completion        with +-* in the filenames.
    o   If the srcfile argument to parse() is not NULL, it will be added        to the result as a "srcfile" attribute.
    o   It is no longer possible to interrupt lazy-loading (which was        only at all likely when lazy-loading environments), which        would leave the object being loaded in an unusable state.        This is a temporary measure: error-recovery when evaluating        promises will be tackled more comprehensively in 2.6.0.
INSTALLATION
    o   'make check' will work with --without-iconv, to accommodate        building on AIX where the system iconv conflicts with        libiconv and is not compatible with R's requirements.
    o   There is support for 'DESTDIR': see the R-admin manual.
    o   The texinfo manuals are now converted to HTML with a style        sheet: in recent versions of makeinfo the markup such as @file        was being lost in the HTML rendering.
    o   The use of inlining has been tweaked to avoid warnings from        gcc >= 4.2.0 when compiling in C99 mode (which is the default        from configure).
BUG FIXES
    o   as.dendrogram() failed on objects of class "dendrogram".
    o   plot(type ="s") (or "S") with many (hundreds of thousands)        of points could overflow the stack.  (PR#9629)
    o   Coercing an S4 classed object to "matrix" (or other basic class)        failed to unset the S4 bit.
    o   The 'useS4' argument of print.default() had been broken by an        unrelated change prior to 2.4.1.  This allowed print() and        show() to bounce badly constructed S4 objects between        themselves indefinitely.
    o   Prediction of the seasonal component in HoltWinters() was one        step out at one point in the calculations.
        decompose() incorrectly computed the 'random' component for a        multiplicative fit.
    o   Wildcards work again in unlink() on Unix-alikes (they did not        in 2.5.0).
    o   When qr() used pivoting, the coefficient names in qr.coef() were        not pivoted to match.  (PR#9623)
    o   UseMethod() could crash R if the first argument was not a        character string.
    o   R and Rscript on Unix-alikes were not accepting spaces in -e        arguments (even if quoted).
    o   Hexadecimal integer constants (e.g. 0x10L) were not being parsed        correctly on platforms where the C function atof did not        accept hexadecimal prefixes (as required by C99, but not        implemented in MinGW as used by R on Windows).  (PR#9648)
    o   libRlapack.dylib on Mac OS X had no version information and        sometimes an invalid identification name.
    o   Rd conversion of \usage treated '\\' as a single backslash in        all but latex: it now acts consistently with the other        verbatim-like environments (it was never 'verbatim' despite        the documentation).
        \code{\.} is now rendered as '\.' in all formats, as        documented (it was not the case for latex conversion).
        codoc() (and checkDocStyle() and checkDocUsage()) now apply        the same transformations to \usage as Rd conversion does,        so {, % and \\ in strings in usages will now be related        correctly to the help files.
    o   rbind() failed if the only data frame had 0 rows. (PR#9657)
    o   <a data.frame>[i, j] could sometimes select the wrong column        when j is numeric if there are duplicate column names.
    o   sample(x, size, replace=TRUE, prob) had a memory leak if        10000 < size <= 100000.
    o   x <- cbind(1:2); rownames(x) <- factor(c("A",NA))  now longer        segfaults.
    o   R CMD BATCH no longer assumes Sys.unsetenv() is supported (it        is not on older Solaris systems).
    o   median() returned a logical result when it was 'NA': it now        returns an NA of appropriate type (e.g. integer or double).
    o   grep(fixed = TRUE, perl = TRUE) ignored 'fixed', although it        was documented to ignore 'perl'        Same for [g]regexpr and [g]sub.
    o   getNamespaceExports("base") works again.
    o   runmed(c(), 1) no longer segfaults.
    o   qr.coef(QR, b) failed for an LAPACK-produced QR if b was        integer or for an over-determined system.
        qr.solve() for an under-determined system produces a        solution with 0 and not NA for columns which are unused.
    o   segments() was not handling full transparency correctly in PDF.        (PR#9694)
        Nor was arrows().
    o   callGeneric() inside a method with extra arguments {and hence        currently defined via .local()} now works.
    o   [g]sub(fixed=TRUE, useBytes=FALSE) could substitute in the        wrong place in an MBCS locale.
        gregexpr() could give incorrect answers in MBCS locales for        perl = TRUE or fixed = TRUE (unless useBytes = TRUE).
    o   The legacy quartz() device no longer crashes in locator()        if the user attempts to close the window.
    o   "CGGStackRestore: gstack underflow" warning is no longer shown        in legacy quartz() device.
    o   formatC() now limits 'digits' to 50 to avoid problems in        C-level sprintf in some OSes.
    o   seq.int(x, y, by=z) gave 'x' (and not an error) if        0 > (y-x)/z > -1.
    o   promptClass() now lists methods, including those for generics in        other attached packages.
    o   Connection-related functions such as readBin() no longer crash        when supplied with a non-connection object.
    o   as.character.srcref() didn't handle bad srcref objects cleanly.
    o   predict.nls() no longer requires 'newdata' to contain exactly        the variable names needed to fit the model: variables used on        the LHS only are no longer required and further variables are        allowed.
    o   plot.hclust() had a 'out by one' error, and ignored the last        object when computing the window region (and could overrun        arrays).
    o   deriv() was creating results with double (and not integer) dims.
    o   The unserialize code (e.g. as called by load()) looked for a        function findPackageEnv() to set a saved package environment.        This was missing, but is now supplied.
    o   [cr]bind could segfault when creating a list matrix result.        (Reported by Martin Morgan.)
    o   besselI(x, nu, exp=TRUE) and besselY(x, nu) could give wrong        answers for nu < 0. (Reported by Hiroyuki Kawakatsu.)
    o   [g]sub could confuse a trailing byte '\' for a backreference        in MBCSs where '\' can occur as a trailing byte (not UTF-8 nor        EUC-JP, but SJIS and the CJK character sets used on Windows).        (PR#9751)
