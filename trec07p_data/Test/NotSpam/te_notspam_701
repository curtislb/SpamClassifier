Building a package is one way, and not that difficult once you've read
the Writing R Extensions manual.

An alternative is to have a directory where you keep R function scripts.
Put your functions in here in text files with say a .R extension. Then
in R you can source one or more of these R scripts as required, using
the source() function.

Say you have a directory, myScripts at the base of file system
(/home/user say on Linux or C:\ on Windows). in this directory there is
a file called my_r_function.R. To use this script/function in an R
session, you would issue:

## replace /home/user/ with what ever is the correct path for your
## system
source("/home/user/myScripts/my_r_function.R")

Which would make available to your current session any functions defined
in my_r_function.R.

Read ?source for more information.
