Thanks for all the answers. I know there are other better ways of doing this
shuffle. I must however, use pop shift ans push.

#!/usr/bin/perl

@startingdeck = ("A H","2 H","3 H","4 H","5 H","6 H","7 H","8 H",
                 "9 H","10 H","J H","Q H","K H",
                 "A D","2 D","3 D","4 D","5 D","6 D","7 D","8 D",
                 "9 D","10 D","J D","Q D","K D",
                 "A C","2 C","3 C","4 C","5 C","6 C","7 C","8 C",
                 "9 C","10 C","J C","Q C","K C",
                 "A S","2 S","3 S","4 S","5 S","6 S","7 S","8 S",
                 "9 S","10 S","J S","Q S","K S");

for ($x=0;$x<100;$x++){

   $shuffle1 = shift(@startingdeck);
   $ahuffle2 = shift(@startingdeck);
   $ahuffle3 = pop(@startingdeck);
   $ahuffle4 = pop(@startingdeck);

   push(@startingdeck,$shuffle1,$shuffle3,$shuffle2,$shuffle4);
   print "@startingdeck\n";
}

I get it all shuffled up the way I want. I just want now the top five cards
printed. Which when running this script:

3 H 4 H 5 H 6 H 7 H

Anyway of doing that without changing all the pushing, shifing and popping?

Thanks for all your help. I've been stuck on this for days (or is it a week
already?)

Amichai
