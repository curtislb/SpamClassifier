You are missing two lines here.

use strict;
use warnings;

If you don't put those two lines you will be surprised by what Perl
does with your code.

Don't do this.  This is a C style for loop.  C style for loops are bad
for a number of reasons I will go into if you ask.  Instead use the
Perl style for loop:

for my $x (0 .. 99) {

Remember how I said you would be surprised?  Well, here you are
assigning $ahuffle2 and later you are using $shuffle2.  Without the
strict pragma Perl thinks this is just fine and uses the empty
variable $shuffle2 even though you meant it to use $affulle2.  Also,
never number your variables like this.  It is sign you are using the
wrong type of variable.  What yo really need is an array:

my @shuffle = shift(@startingdeck), shift(@startingdeck),
pop(@startingdeck), pop(@startingdeck);
push @startingdeck, @shuffle;

Well, you have a couple options.  You could use a slice:

print "@startingdeck[0 .. 4]\n";

You could use indexes:

print "$startingdeck[0] $startingdeck[1] $startingdeck[2]
$startingdeck[3] $startingdeck[4]\n";

You could use a loop

for my $i (0 .. 4) {
   print shift $startingdeck;
}
print "\n";

You could flatten the list into a string and take a substr of it

print substr("@startingdeck", 0, 4*5), "\n"; #four characters five times

And a bunch of other ways.
