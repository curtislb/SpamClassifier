Thanks Tom.

I added the line immediately after the #!/usr/bin/perl line and ran the 
script. It didn't give any output, but when I redirected the output to VIM it 
reported the error line as

^Z at ../bin/walon line 25

It looks like Tie::Handle::CSV just dies when there are no records left.

I've looked at the perldoc for the module and I can't see any reference to why 
it should do this, or how to stop it.
