     Are you talking about SpeakUp in X11?  I thought Speakup could
already paste between consoles, or was that changed?  I haven't tried
SpeakUp's paste feature yet.  What is it exactly that you're trying to
do?  Do you actually want to *cut* from the screen, rather than copy
from it?  If that's the case, you're talking about crossing from
kernalspace to userspace.  Kirk would have to make SpeakUp ...Hmmm.
Maybe erase with backspacing...No.  That would only work if the cursor
position matched the cutting  cursor position.  You're dealing with two
different cursor positions.  The twain may never meet without some
extensive programming and/or software recognition.  vi's controls are
different from emacs, for instance.  Cutting would have to be performed
through differing interface controls.  Backspacing *might* work, if
cursor tracking was employed.  Some programs won't let you backspace to
the previous line.  Complexity increases when you're using a remote 
console..  You have to be able to control the position of the userspace 
cursor, independant of keymaps, terminals, and individual program 
controls.  I think it would work if there was a consistant method for 
repositioning the userspace cursor, but I doubt that there is.  I hope 
that's what you're talking about, anyway.
