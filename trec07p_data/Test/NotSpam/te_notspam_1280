I *explicitly* wrote this disclaimer in my comment message ("The usual
disclaimers: IANAL, IANADD."): I cannot understand why you seem to have

Since I explicitly noted that IANAL, it goes without saying that I
cannot give legal advice.

I would have said so, if I had the opportunity to get legal advice on
the matter.

Great!  Because free software is about asking every copyright holder of
each package for permission to do anything!    :-(

So, at the end of the day, you too think that the intended meaning of
the clause can be the one I am afraid it is...   :-?

Well, it would be interesting to hear what a real lawyer has to say
about this clause and its interpretation.

Especially considering that works released under the terms of GNU GPL v3
are already entering Debian: see bug #431165...


Big disclaimers: IANAL, TINLA, IANADD, ATATIAAWBI (According To Anthony
                 Towns, I Am Always Wrong Because IANADD/IANAL), ...


BTW, are *you* a lawyer?
Is *your* reply legal advice?
Or is it *based* on legal advice?
