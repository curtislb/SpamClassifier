Yes, it can, in principle, be done.

Hardly ever. Alas. Although it's most likely to work with pure Perl
modules, and least likely to work with anything compiled.

If you really need to do this, the only practical way I know of is to
set up an identical box (the "staging" machine) that you can really
install and test on. When you have something working on the staging
machine, you can copy that to the production system that lacks a
compiler. If it doesn't work when it gets there, either you didn't get
it all there properly, or the two boxes aren't really all that
identical, so you get to try again until you get it right. Or until
you get a compiler on the box, as nature intended.

Good luck with it!
