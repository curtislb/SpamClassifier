Yeah, I'm thinking of maintaining both the latest 2.4 and 2.6
kernels.  I have a Cisco VPN client that works OK with a 2.4 kernel
but as soon as I throw it on a 2.6 kernel, I keep getting miss-matched
kernel versions or some such; I thought it was compiled to work with
2.6 but here we go with closed source again <yuck!>.
