Matthew,
I think the point there was to find a graphing module you like, and gofrom there. As far as the back end is concerned, and "AJAX" (a.k.a.xmlhttp) request is just like any other http request. the client--inthis case a javascript script--requests information from the server.Any server technology can handle AJAX, from plain old CGI.pm to thebig frameworks like Catalyst. Any of the templating systems like TT orMason can output data data in any format you need.
So, find a graphing system you're comfortable with. Then decide ifthis is a small project you wat to code directly as CGI or mod_perl,or a largr project you want to use a framework or CMS to build. Thendecide which framework wnd which templating system, if any.
Personally, I like the combination of Maypole and Template Toolkit.but that's just a personal preference. Anything that can send data toa web browser can serve XML or JSON data to and AJAX script.
For graphing, I think most AJAX application actually use javascript todraw in the client, rather than passing pre-made images from theserver, but if you're doing complex graphing, any thing that producesan image format browsers can read will work.
HTH,
