And as I see it, if I say "My program is licenced under GPLv3 with the 
following exceptions ...", if the user ignores the exception, they have 
broken the terms I set for them to use the program, and the GPL doesn't 
apply, so they can't take advantage of the clause allowing them to 
remove the exception ...

At the end of the day, the intentions of the licensor are important, and 
if those intentions are made explicitly clear, it's a bit difficult for 
the GPL to contradict them.

The main effect of this clause will probably be to discourage people 
from doing this sort of thing - I'm not at all sure that clause would 
actually have teeth in a court of law.

Cheers,
Wol
