Maybe this is stupid, but if you need user-space screen access, couldn't you
just use Yasr? Can't its keymap be modified enough to mimic speakup?

I guess yasr is really pretty primitive compared to speakup; it can't track
highlighting for example. 

But maybe it would be easier, programatically to just improve yasr rather
than rewrite speakup.
