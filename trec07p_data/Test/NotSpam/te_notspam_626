...just to toss some random brainstorms into the mix here...

To avoid svn-specific behavior, is there perhaps another file in the 
repository that we could use to compare timestamp against?
I personally don't have an issue with tying things to svn -- I just
think we might be able to do it otherwise.  Even possibly "check files
modified within the last NN hours".

Also, instead of running/mailing the perlcritic tests on every checkin,
we could perhaps set up a cron job to do it once per day.  This would keep
potential mail messages down, and may be easier to set up and control
than a subversion hook.  (I could fairly quickly set up such a system
as part of the daily smoke tests that I already run from my box.)

Again, just some random ideas...
