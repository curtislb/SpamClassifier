Hiya,
    I suppose that Gnome really isn't absolutely necesary.  I've heard some 
technical complaints about Dropline.  One of those seems to be that it 
installs PAM, which isn't really something I'm familiar with.  From what I 
gather, it complicates traditional ways of doing things considerably.
Thanks for your help.  I'll try and see what happens, maybe.
All the best,
Zack.
