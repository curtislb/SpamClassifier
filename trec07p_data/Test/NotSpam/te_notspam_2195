If you can't help, I guess there is no one else who can?

Trying again anyway, since when I don't get answers from anywhere, I can't=
=20
work on it freely, so I won't work on it at all and it perhaps won't ever g=
et=20
packaged for Debian. Vicious circle...

Is this thing (or any license in general, if that could be more easily=20
answered) somehow mixable with the GPL? Eg. that I publish my derived work=
=20
under the GPL and make an exception for Strategy First to grant them what=20
they want?
