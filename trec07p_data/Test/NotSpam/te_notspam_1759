Yeah, I don't use the most optimal method of iterating through all of
this.  $tix is a reference to a hash of ticket objects.  The ->Next
method simply places each successive object into $ticket for further
processing by other methods.

I'll see what I can do with this.  It looks simple enough and as I'm now
working my way through Intermediate Perl ( ;) ) I might actually be able
to grasp it :)

Good assumption :)
