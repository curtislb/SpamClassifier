Or it could be an option.
It should be noted that admins should add a cron job to clean up, in
case someone unlinks the original file from the unix side without going
through samba.
Unlink is the only operation that comes to mind, the other risk is
creating a new file after another has been unilinked and getting the
same inode number. But I guess these are corner cases, and if we are
really paranoid I guess we can find a way to make sure some other
metadata is used to detect such condition.

The biggest problem is leaking streams from one user to another:
userA delete fileA with streamA
userB create fileB
accidentally fileB inode == fileA
userB has streamA data in fileB

Simo.
