Iran Rations Gasoline

Alternative Energy Will Eventually Not Be "Alternative"

My Favorite Wind Power Stock

-----

Last week I was shocked (and amused) to read that Iran had instituted
gasoline rationing.  Iran, you see is the second largest exporter of oil
in OPEC.  It has the world's second largest reserves of natural gas and
third largest reserves of oil.  Yet it can't even make enough gasoline to
meet the needs of its citizens.

The problem?  There's a shortage of refineries.  Refineries are very
expensive to build and they mess up the environment; the last refinery
built in the U.S. began operating in 1976.

Of course, since then, the U.S. (at least parts of it) has been working to
conserve energy by building more fuel-efficient cars.

But Iran's gasoline use has been growing at about 10% per year (a trend
driven in part by government subsidies that keep its gasoline prices among
the lowest in the world), and sanctions on the country have made it
difficult for Iran to get the foreign input it needs to build new
refineries.

So Iran imports over 40% of its gasoline needs.  But rising prices for
gasoline globally (you've noticed?) have been squeezing the government,
and so the surprise solution this week was to ration the stuff.

Of course, rationing wasn't popular in the U.S. in the 1970s, and it's no
more popular in Iran today.

So what's the solution?

For Iran, the solution, as my father would say, is to shape up.

In fact, a bill introduced in the House of Representatives last week aims
to say just that, by increasing the power of sanctions to limit investment
in Iran by European countries.

One wrinkle: cash-hungry Asian countries that are less inclined to heed
the dictates of the U.S. are stepping up to fill Iran's need as best they
can.  In the meantime, Iranian citizens fume.

How this will end, no one knows, but it should remind us to consider the
state of our own energy dependency.

It's ironic that the world's second largest exporter of oil can't supply
gasoline for its own people.

And on a larger scale, it's ironic that the 21st century, which promised
to be the digital age, has been colored so much by the trends of
increasing demand (and prices) for raw materials!  Steel, copper, oil,
phosphate, titanium, uranium.  I can name hot stocks in every one of these
groups that have had better runs in this century than at any time in my
lifetime . . .and no one saw it coming.

So what's next?

Well, I learned long ago that trends, once in effect, tend to last longer
than expected, so all I can say is that you should assume this one will
continue.

We know that China and India are hungry for basic materials, from steel to
oil to coal.

And we know the developed world in particular is hungry for alternative
energy sources, especially those that don't pollute.   
Today these are lumped into a vague category called "Alternative Energy",
suggesting a secondary status, but we're confident that in time,
better-defined subgroups will break out of that fuzzy label and claim
their own identity.

The solar sector will certainly be one; in recent issues of Cabot Wealth
Advisory, I've recommended a number of solar power stocks, both American
and Chinese, and I still think highly of most of those.  The best three
were hitting new price highs last week!

I've discussed uranium, too, and while that sector is not as strong today,
the leader in the industry is still worth holding.

But today I want to talk about wind power.

Today, wind power accounts for less than 1% of global electricity use, but
it accounts for 20% in Denmark, 9% in Spain and 7% in Germany.

Germany is actually the biggest producer of wind power, and this year the
U.S. will pass Spain to become the second largest producer.   
Texas is the leading state in wind energy production, followed by
California.  Total U.S. capacity is growing at about 30% per year.

Globally, the market grew at a 41% rate in 2005 and a 32% rate in 2006. 
Looking forward, 25% per year seems easily sustainable, but predictions
have little value here.

What does have value is an appreciation of the major forces at work, and
an ability to read charts.

Growing demand we understand.  It's driven by high fuel costs, a
perception that oil may run out, a growing determination to address the
causes of global warming, and growing demand for energy independence.

And the wind is free, which is pretty cool.  But to capture it you've got
to use a wind turbine (not a windmill), and that's where the three big
drawbacks come from.

First are the high upfront costs for wind turbines that are expected to
run for two decades or more.  Once they're installed, the wind is free and
operational costs are minor.  But the investment is a hurdle.

Second is the fact that regardless of where wind turbines are sited,
sometimes the wind doesn't blow, which means either energy needs to be
stored or it needs to be supplemented by other electricity sources.

Third is the fact that connecting to the grid from remote locations is
expensive, and wasteful.  It's better to put wind turbines close to the
point of need, but few people want them in their backyards!

But even with these obstacles, the industry is growing fast.

Costs are coming down, driven by both economies of scale and improving
technologies.  And growing public consciousness about global warming and
energy independence means people are slowly becoming more acceptable of
wind turbines in their backyards.

So, it makes sense that companies in the industry are seeing their stocks
soar.

Our favorite is a company called Zoltek, which was owned by Cabot Market
Letter from 1996 to 1998 for a 68% profit.  And it's a good thing we sold,
because from top to bottom, the stock lost 68% of its value.  But
investors are once again climbing on board, and the stock is strong.

I mentioned this stock in Cabot Wealth Advisory back on April 12, and it's
up about 20% since then.  And then two weeks ago it had become so strong
that it earned a spot in Cabot Top Ten Report.

Here's what editor Mike Cintolo wrote:

"When oil gets expensive and the specter of global warming sends investors
scurrying in pursuit of non-fossil energy options, it's good for Zoltek. 
Demand for clean energy has raised global wind generation capacity 10-fold
since 1997, and Zoltek is the only large supplier of the industrial grade
carbon fiber that has replaced fiberglass in the manufacture of wind
turbine blades.  The company has come a long way since it acquired a
carbon fiber business in 1988, and its transition from a focus on
high-margin high-tech applications (like rocket nozzles for NASA) to a
stronger, lighter replacement for fiberglass hasn't always gone smoothly. 
Product quality issues dogged the company in 2006 and the wide-scale use
of carbon fiber has been slower to develop than anticipated.  But quality
issues have been tamed, wind power is a huge market, and the oil
exploration and automotive industries are shaping up as the growth markets
of the future. A huge long-term carbon fiber agreement with DeWind
announced on June 12 is the latest good news for the company."

Adding to that, I can see that revenues were up 67% last year (to $92
million), that earnings are expected to grow 208% this year (to $0.77 per
share), and that the company's profit margin in the latest quarter was
14.4%, the best in many years.

All told, business is good now, and promises to be even better as the
industry expands around the globe.
