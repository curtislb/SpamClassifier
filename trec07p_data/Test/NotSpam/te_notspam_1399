Clause 2c of GPLv2 is already an inconvenience and border-line with
respect to DFSG-freeness.  This is, at least, my humble opinion on the
matter.
"Border-line" does not mean that it *fails* the DFSG, but that it's
*very close* to fail.

Extending this clause from interfaces that "read commands
interactively" to every kind of "interactive user interface" is really
making things worse, which is exactly what I commented.

Compare with the obnoxious advertising clause of the 4-clause BSD
license: it's an inconvenience close to fail the DFSG, IMO.  But we
accept it as DFSG-free.  However, I would *not* be happy to see a
license that *extends* this restriction to a wider scenario.

I didn't say that.
It's not exaclty the same requirement and I didn't say that it's
necessarily non-free.=20

Clause 2c of GPLv2 is close to fail the DFSG, but passes.
Clause 5d of GPLv3 is worse (since it's more restrictive, being extended
to more cases), and hence it's even closer to fail the DFSG.
Whether it fails or passes is to be decided: I simply said "possibly",
you say it's OK.  Let's see what others think...

Mmmmh, if one cannot redistribute a work (because of patents or
whatever), I think it fails DFSG#1...

DFSG#1 says "The license of a Debian component may not restrict [...]",
so maybe one can argue that the copyright license cannot be blamed
for patent restrictions.
But DFSG#1 does not talk about "copyright license", merely about
"license".
If there are actively enforced patents, I not only need a copyright
license in order to redistribute, but also a patent license.  If the
patent license forbids me to redistribute, I think the work fails
DFSG#1; if no patent license is available to me, I am not allowed to
redistribute, and consequently the work again fails DFSG#1.

Or, at least, this is how I used to understand it...
