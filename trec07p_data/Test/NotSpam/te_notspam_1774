OK, maybe I used misleading words (remember that IANAENS, I Am Not An
English Native Speaker).

What I mean is that, IMHO, clause 2c is a flaw of GPLv2.
Not a flaw which is bad enough to make the license fail to meet the
DFSG, but close to do so.

In this sense, it's "border-line": it could be or not be enough to make
the license non-free.  Upon careful analysis, it turns out to be close
to the DFSG-freeness boundary, but fortunately on the free side.

This is my own view on clause 2c.
IANADD, TINASOTODP (This Is Not A Statement Of The Official Debian
Position).


Because of this opinion I hold on GPLv2#2c, I see GPLv3#5d as something
worse.
It's the same requirement extended from interfaces that "read commands
interactively" to every kind of "interactive user interface".  Extending
a flaw is making things worse.

It *is* worse: not qualitatively worse, but quantitatively worse.
Maybe it's not worse enough to become non-free, but it's worse anyway.

IMHO, it is.  IANADD, TINASOTODP.

Well, it seems that even DFSG-freeness judgements are not always so
objective, or otherwise we would not be discussing about them all the
time on this list...

I think you are talking about clause 3b of GPLv2, aren't you?

Maybe you picked the wrong example, because clause 3b *is* a non-free
restriction.  Fortunately there's another alternative option,
represented by clause 3a, which is DFSG-free, and consequently GPLv2 is
acceptable.

This is my opinion, but also the opinion of other debian-legal regulars.

Quite possibly I will fail.
That's why I pointed out clause 5d as a flaw, *without* saying that I
believed it was definitely non-free.
I said that it's "possibly a DFSG-freeness issue" and waited for other
comments (which I am already getting).

Woaah!
Feeling appreciated is always gratifying!

Sometimes it's not third-party, but belongs to the same entity which
holds copyright on the work.

Anyway, I think I get what you mean: you see the software patent one as
an "external problem", not to be blamed to the work itself, and hence
not affecting the freeness of the work.  Just like a stupid law that
forbids the distribution of programs that lack a GUI, or something
similarly absurd...

According to this view, let's rephrase my comments on patent-related
clauses and just say "possibly an insufficient protection from patent
lawsuits".
With the understanding that the GPLv2 is even less protecting against
those issues.
