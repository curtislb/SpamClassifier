Hi, I am pretty new to R, so I apologize for the obvious question.
I
have worked with R for a few months now and in the process have written
several functions that I frequently use in various data analysis
projects. I tend to give each project a directory of its own and set
the working directory to that.
Since there are several tasks that
need to be accomplished in many of my projects, I frequently want to
use functions I have written previously. My question is, how do I get
access to them? The way I do it now is copy the relevant code to the
script file of the project I am working on at the time and then run it
so as to make the functions available. But that seems to be
unnecessarily cumbersome. I used to work a lot with gauss, which had
the opportunity of putting one's own functions is one directory and
gauss would then have that directory in its search path always. How can
I access my own functions in R without having to copy-paste them
everytime and run them manually so I can call them later? Do I need to
learn how to write a package and attach the package to make the
functions available at all times? Is there another way?

thanks, James
