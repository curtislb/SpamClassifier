SatCon Photovoltaic Inverters Installed at Largest US Commercial Site




BOSTON, Jun 27, 2007 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- SatCon Technology Corporation(R)
(Nasdaq CM: SATC), a developer of power management and system
architecture solutions for the alternative energy and distributed power
markets today announced that its PowerGate(R) commercial grade inverters
have been installed as an integral part of Google's corporate
headquarters in Mountain View, California. The 1.6MW system is the
largest commercial photovoltaic system in the United States. 

Sharp provided 9,212 208-watt modules for the project, which was
designed and installed by EI Solutions of San Rafael, California.
SatCon's PowerGate(R) high-efficiency inverters are a critical component
of the system, converting the sun's energy produced by the photovoltaic
panels into alternating current electricity that is used to power the
facility. To date, SatCon has shipped more than 50 MW of its industry
leading commercial grade inverters in North America. 

The new system will spare the air nearly 3,637,627 lbs/year of harmful
greenhouse gases annually. Over the next 30 years, the carbon dioxide
reduction will be equivalent to eliminating over 128 million car driving
miles. 

About PowerGate(TM) Inverters 

PowerGate(TM) inverters are designed for use with alternative energy
power systems to generate distributed electrical power. Distributed,
alternative energy power generation is a growing trend toward the
production of clean, reliable power at the point of use. Alternative
energy systems can alleviate congestion on highly loaded utility
electrical distribution networks and offer an alternative to power line
extensions in remote areas. Many alternative energy power systems
require high-power, high-reliability inverters and controls to convert
the power generated to useable AC power compatible with the electric
power grid.

electronics and generators/motors for the Renewable Energy,
Hybrid-Electric Vehicle, Grid Support, High Reliability Electronics and
