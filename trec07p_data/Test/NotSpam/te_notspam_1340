"you cannot forbid circumvention of technological measures" is not the same
thing as "you cannot seek recourse under the law if the user commits a crime
against you using the work".

No, because that's criminal trespass, which is distinct from the
"circumvention of technological measures" which is being waived.

No, it's different from GPLv2 2c only in that it's extended to "interactive
user interfaces" instead of just programs that "read commands interactively
when run".

Welcome to 1991.

It's absurd to say that this requirement is permissible in the GPLv2 but not
in the GPLv3.

Um, no.  The DFSG does not require indemnification against third-party
claims; an actively-enforced patent may require us to *not distribute the
work at all*, but that's not a question of DFSG-freeness of the work.

Um, no, it doesn't.
