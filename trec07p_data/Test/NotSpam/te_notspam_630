Several readers let us know that the University of Washington has
announced that it will [0]pass on RIAA settlement offer letters to
students identified, presumably by IP address, as suspected file sharers.
"The notices say offending students have 20 days to settle with the
association by paying it about $3,000 to $5,000 or be taken to court
without possibility of a settlement." The Vice Provost for Student Life
sent an email to all students saying, "The University has been notified
by the RIAA that we will be receiving a number of these early settlement
letters. After careful consideration, we have decided to forward the
letters to the alleged copyright violators."

[0]WSJdpatton writes "Walt Mossberg [1]tested the iPhone for two weeks,
in multiple usage scenarios, in cities across the US. His verdict is
that, despite some flaws and feature omissions, the iPhone is on balance
a beautiful and breakthrough hand-held computer. Its software especially
sets a new bar for the smart-phone industry, and its clever finger-touch
interface, which dispenses with a stylus and most buttons, works well,
though the lack of physical buttons can be a hindrance." Digital Daily
has a [2]roundup of early iPhone reviews.

Nom du Keyboard writes "According to [0]this article in The Inquirer and
[1]this Microsoft Knowledge Base article, a fix for some significant
problems in many of Intel's most recent processors has been quietly
released — by whom is not clear. Patches are available on Microsoft's
site. Affected processors include Core 2 Duo E4000/E6000, Core 2 Quad
Q6600, Core 2 Xtreme X6800, XC6700, and XC6800. Details on just what has
been fixed are scanty (it's called a 'reliability update'), however, it's
probably more important than either Intel or Microsoft is openly
admitting." There is no indication that Apple users are affected.

Stony Stevenson asks, rhetorically, "What do whale-feces researchers,
hazmat divers, and employees of Microsoft's Security Response Center have
in common? They all made Popular Science magazine's [0]2007 list of the
absolute worst jobs in science." Quoting: "The MSRC ranked near the
middle as the sixth-worst job in this year's list.. 'We did rate the
Microsoft security researcher as less-bad than the people who prepare the
carcasses for dissection in biology laboratories,' Moyer said. Moyer
didn't have to think long when asked whether he'd rather have the number
10-ranked whale research job. 'Whale feces or working at Microsoft? I
would probably be the whale feces researcher,' he said. 'Salt air and
whale flatulence; what could go wrong?'" Here's the [1]Popular Mechanics
list all on one page.

An anonymous reader informs us that the CIA has recently declassified for
your reading pleasure some records relating to [0]illegal spying,
assassination attempts, and other goodies. These are [1]available from
the CIA's FOIA portal. From the BBC article: " Last week, CIA chief
Michael Hayden announced the decision to declassify the records, saying
the documents were 'unflattering but part of CIA history.' The documents
detail assassination plots, domestic spying, wiretapping, and
kidnapping... Among the documents is a request in 1972 for someone 'who
was accomplished at picking locks' who might be retiring or resigning
from the agency."

the report based on a full Linux distro including optional components,

to try playing with our new experimental Discussion2 system. It's very
nearly complete at this point. You can activate it with a checkbox on any

continue bending it to see when it breaks. 'There's a raging debate

[787 General Manager Mike] Bair.'" They have [1]come a long way in wing

hopes will put them back in the running for top dog in the supercomputer
race. "The linchpin in the system is the switch, the piece of hardware
that conducts traffic between the servers, memory and data storage.
Code-named Magnum, the switch comes with 3,456 ports, a
larger-than-normal number that frees up data pathways inside these
powerful computers. 'We are looking at a factor-of-three improvement over
the current best system at an equal number of nodes," said Andy
Bechtolsheim, chief architect and senior vice president of the systems
group at Sun. "We have been somewhat absent in the supercomputer market
in the last few years.'"

megabytes of online storage for their documents, music, photos and video.
They're offering it to a select 5,000 test users for now, but will make
it widely available later this summer. This move is the latest in a
series by the previous large corporation we all loved to hate to compete
