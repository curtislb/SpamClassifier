This is really strange, the prefix pkgconfig is built with is supposed 
to be on the config path by default. What does "which pkg-config" give? 
What is PKG_CONFIG_PATH set to originally?

I checked in a fix for this yesterday night. Easier solution to avoid a

most developers are running F7 you might get less problem if you run on 
it...
