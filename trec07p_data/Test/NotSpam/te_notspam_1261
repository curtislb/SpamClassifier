Dear Cabot Wealth Advisory Reader,

Every day there are big stories in the news about China . . . and most of
them are about problems: contaminated toothpaste, contaminated fish, lead
paint on toy trains, children slaving at brick kilns.

At first glance, China is a country with big problems.

But the same can be said for our country.  Our news stories feature
children shooting up schools, corrupt politicians, thieving CEOs and
more.

Yet for most of us, life is pretty good.  And most of us don't get our
safe, happy lives splashed on Page 1 because, well, it wouldn't sell
newspapers.

I'm not going to blame the media here, though I do sympathize with Tony
Blair, who likened the famously vicious British media "feral dogs."

The media serves the market.

And if you take the market out of the equation, and simply publish the
good news, what do you get?   You get China Daily, the English-language
paper that I read several times when I was over there this spring.

Controlled by the Communist Party of China, the paper tends to publish
stories that glorify the progress being made in China.  You get stories
about the economic growth of rural districts, about the educational
triumphs of young scholars, about factories being constructed and roads
being built, etc.

Riveting journalism it's not.

But China Daily does present one side of the truth well, the fact that
China is booming.

In fact, China's boom is unlike any seen before on this world.  It's the
most populous country on earth.  It's a Communist state driven by
capitalism.  And it's in transition.  But to where?

The "experts" certainly don't know.   If you ask a dozen political and
economic experts where China is going, you'll get a dozen responses.

And I don't know either.  But I don't need to know.

When I jumped on China's uptrend over three years ago, and published the
first issue of Cabot China & Emerging Markets Report, I didn't know where
it was going.  But I knew the trend was up!  Back then there were only a
handful of Chinese stocks to buy.

Today there are over 100 Chinese stocks traded here in the U.S., and I'm
proud that Cabot China & Emerging Markets was recognized as the top
performer off all investment newsletters in the country last year, with a
return of 76%.

Editor Paul Goodwin continues to ride the wave this year, while
diversifying prudently into stocks of Russia, India and Brazil.

Big winners include Ctrip, up 130%, Vimpel, up 65% and Focus Media, up
91%.

The issue just published features one of my favorite Chinese stocks.   
It's a big old state-owned oil company with a sweetheart deal that would
be criminal in the U.S., but is working very well for both this company
and country right now.

You've got to read it to believe it.

P.S.  As we all know, the Olympics is coming to Beijing next summer, and
the Communist leaders are going to pull out all the stops to show the
world how far they've come.  If you want to make money by investing in
China, there's no better time to start than now!
