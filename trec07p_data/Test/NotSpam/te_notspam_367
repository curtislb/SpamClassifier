IRS e-News for Small Businesses

Issue 2007-23

June 27, 2007

In this Issue:

1. Home Office Deduction 
2. Can’t Pay the Entire Balance Due on a Tax Return?
3. Are You Aware of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit?
4. e-News for Small Businesses to Come Every Other Week Until Labor Day Starting July 11
5. Recent IRS Announcements 

1. Home Office Deduction

If you use a portion of your home regularly and exclusively for business purposes, you may be able to take a percentage of your expenses as a home office deduction. 
http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=108138,00.html 
  
Expenses may include the business portion of real estate taxes, mortgage interest, rent, utilities, insurance, depreciation, painting and repairs.

2. Can’t Pay the Entire Balance Due on a Tax Return?

No one plans on getting behind in their taxes, but sometimes it happens. The first thing to do is contact the IRS and explain your situation.

For taxpayers who cannot resolve their tax debt immediately, an installment agreement http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=108347,00.html can be a reasonable payment option.

If you don’t make an effort to pay the bill, or make other payment arrangements, the IRS could take more serious enforced collection action http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=108332,00.html  which may have an adverse affect on your credit rating.

--It’s Important to Pay Taxes in Full  http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=108330,00.html

3. Are You Aware of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit?

After December 31, 2006, the Welfare-to-Work Credit was combined with the Work Opportunity Credit. http://www.irs.gov/publications/p553/ch02.html#d0e2529 

The WOC provides an incentive for businesses to hire individuals from targeted groups http://www.irs.gov/faqs/faq-kw208.html  that have a particularly high unemployment rate or other special employment needs. 

There are also some changes for employees, including the qualified veterans group, hired after May 25, 2007. http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i8850.pdf
