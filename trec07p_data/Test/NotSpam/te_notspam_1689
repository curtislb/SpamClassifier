Having read this posting, I find it VERY hard to understand exactly how 
Damian and Mark differ fundamentally. They both seem to be after the 
same thing in the end.

A rhetorical question of my own and an answer.

Q) what is the real difference between comments and documentation?
- Syntactically for the perl parser they are both white space.
- Both are used to explain the code.

A)  Documentation can be extracted from the body of the code by a 
documentation parser. Comments cant.
- Documentation has to be written bearing in mind that it might be 
divorced from the code, so where necessary the code has to be marked so 
that it too will be included in the documentation. Comments dont get 
separated from their context ever.
- The final form of the documentation, viz a manual page or tutorial, 
and hence the structure, viz., headings / subheading, has to be 
considered when writing the software and adding the documentation. Hence 
the layout instructions.
- This suggests that comments and documentation differ only in the extra 
information needed by documentation when the text is separated from the 
code. Comments are never separated from the code.
- Comments are used to convert code to white space, for debugging, 
development etc.

Observations)
1) Programmers prefer to focus on the implementation. Focussing on how 
the documentation will look when extracted can be distracting. And hence 
this disincentivises writing documentation.
2) When writing a useful tutorial or descriptive text, a different 
structure is more often better in explaining the software than the 
structure of the code. Moreover, it may not be apparent at the start of 
writing what structure is better. Yet a program is substantially 
context-free - it matters little if functions with semantic closeness 
are grouped together.
3) Different types of structure and level of documentation are 
appropriate for different purposes.
4) What about links to other modules? When trying to understand some 
code, I find references to unfamilar modules and I would like to be able 
to reference those. Yet currently, I must find the module and work 
through the documentation on that module separately, And if that module 
includes another unfamiliar module, I have to recurse to another level.

Questions:
1) Would it be possible to unify all comments and documentation into a 
single paradigm, such as a sort of bracketting convention with optional 
extra information for other tools to use, eg., layout information, 
grouping information, context (viz., for a tutorial, or reference) 
information?
2) Would it be possible for the brackets to have different 'opacities' 
for the perl parser, so that code can be recognised both as code and as 
documentation with extra information? In this way, code would be 
included in some forms of documentation (eg., function signatures in 
reference manuals) just by placing "transparent" documentation brackets 
around them.
3) Would it be possible for the brackets to have 'opacities' for the 
perl parser that can be set by the value of some variable, hence 
debugging / tracing code could be switched on by setting that variable 
in the code?
4) Is there a means for specifying the way documentation is reassembled, 
eg., a means for defining for say a tutorial a different structure than 
the linear structure of the documentation strings within the software?

Big Questions:
a) Have I missed the conflict points completely?
b) If no, do the questions above provide a means to resolve the 
"philosophically different" approaches to documentation?
c) Am I wrong in thinking that implementing the suggestions in the 
questions should not require a substantial redesign of perl6?
d) If what I have suggested can already be done with Pod, could some 
examples be shown.
