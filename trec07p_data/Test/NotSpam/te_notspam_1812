You continually miss the point that the GPL is explicitly noted as a
free license, which means that anything in the GPL is DFSG free.  That it
doesn't meet your personal standards means that your personal standards
are not in line with the DFSG, not that there is a problem with the
GPL.

See above.  If you don't believe this to hold for the 4 clause BSD, in
the grand tradition of -legal, I refer you to the archives.

Or that some people like to deliberately misinterpret the DFSG in order
to grandstand on this list ....

No, again you have misread the DFSG.  3b is DFSG free, because the DFSG
says the GPL v2 is free.  Debian currently uses 3a because it is much
less effort, but that doesn't mean that 3b is non free.
