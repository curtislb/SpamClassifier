Well my dictionary defines transparent as "allowing light to pass
through so that objects behind can be distinctly seen" which I believe
applies here (ie. stained glass windows and blue points with alpha 0.5
are both transparent).  What does your dictionary say?

I am confused by your implication that windows (prior to XP) does not
support translucency.  Perhaps it is not supported at the operating
system level, but it has certainly been available at the application
level for a very long time.

The features of the windows and X11 devices clearly lag behind the
quartz and pdf devices.  I can program for the lowest common
denominator or I can use modern features that support the tasks I am
working on.  I choose the later, and it is certainly your prerogative
to declare that a bug in me.
