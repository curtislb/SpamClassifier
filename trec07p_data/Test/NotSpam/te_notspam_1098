It is up to us to decide what will be available and how easy. Currently
the default filter is set to "open source software only". So the user
doesn't even see the propriatary packages. You have to change the filter
to "all software" before.

Julian Adres Klode works on getting the basic app-data from the Debian
repository. He can easily add manual virtual applications: flash,
codecs, etc.

The codec/plugin installation would require some patching of other
applications. The gstreamer part should be integrated upstream already,
so that it allows to launch a generic codec installer. But I don't know
about firefox, asac, would be the person to talk to.

I cannot provide any numbers to you. AFAIK the missing dvd menu support
is still the greatest disadvantage of gstreamer. Totem switched to
gstreamer as the default recently: 
http://svn.gnome.org/viewcvs/totem?view=revision&revision=3725

And gstreamer has support for the codec installer :)

Not really yet. But a good idea.
