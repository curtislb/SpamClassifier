With the iPhone release coming soon there is no shortage of stories being
submitted. Here is an overview of all of its [0]features and specifics on
its technical workings. A [1]list of applications is out and still
growing. There are warnings however that [2]some applications and
peripherals won't be ready or compatible in time for the release. Finally
with all the hype associated with the iPhone, we have a reminder of some
[3]previous Apple products that ended with a whimper instead of a roar.

Stony Stevenson writes "In an effort to inject Microsoft's latest slogan,

Google page rank), Microsoft asked a passel of A List Bloggers to write
[0]blurbs on what this meaningless phrase means to them. Michael
Arrington, Om Malik, Fred Wilson, Richard MacManus and a handful of
others happily agreed to churn out some mush for Microsoft, which it
later used in banner ads. What it really meant to these guys was income.
Redmond paid the bloggers for every user who clicked through to the PRB
microsite. That caused other bloggers, lead by Gawker chief Nick Denton,
to rightfully question their ethics. [1]A spitball war has been raging

Commerce Department official's talk at Supernova 2007. The article is
headlined [0]Bush official goes nuclear in New Neut row, and points out
that the speaker, John Kneuer, is a former telecom lobbyist. To figure
out what really went on in that session — whether it was a shouting match
as El Reg reports — be sure to read [1]Suw Charman's notes from the floor
and [2]Kevin Werbach's note (Werbach is the conference organizer).

[0]AlexGr sends us to an excellent article on the state of Xen by Jeff
Gould (Peerstone Research). He concludes that [1]the virtualization
technology has some maturing to do and will face increasing competition
for the privilege of taking on VMWare. Quoting: "What's going on with
Xen, the open source hypervisor that was supposed to give VMware a run
for its money? I can't remember how many IT trade press articles, blog
posts and vendor white papers I've read about Xen in the last few
years... The vast majority of those articles — including a few I've
written myself — take it as an article of faith that Xen's
paravirtualizing technical approach and open source business model are
inherently superior to the closed source alternatives from VMware or
Microsoft."

the implications are interesting. First, contributors have to sign the

forced to submit contributions to the Fedora repository they
automatically fall under the [2]provisions of US export law. So, no OLPC
for Cuba, Syria and the like. Ever."

ancientribe writes "A stealthy and potentially dangerous [0]bug has been
discovered in security products from eight different vendors, including
Check Point Software, according to an article in Dark Reading. The
so-called cross-site request forgery (CSRF) lets an attacker access the
user's network and even conduct transactions on behalf of the user. It
could affect over a million installations, but so far, Check Point is the
only security vendor to step up and patch it. This vulnerability is found
in most everything with a Web-based interface, including printers,
firewalls, DSL routers, and IP phones." An article on the vulnerability
from last fall quotes Jeremiah Grossman, CTO of WhiteHat Security, who
[1]calls CSRF "the sleeping giant" vulnerability: "It's not seen as a
vulnerability because it works like the Web works."

Last week [0]we asked you for questions to pass on to the folks behind
the Gamers2Gamers RMT service. The response, from reading the comments,
was mixed. The thinking seemed to mostly be that this was a marketing
stunt, aimed at getting people to check out their website. There were
several good questions, though, and we passed on the hardest ones to
Sparter CEO Dan Kelly and CTO Boris Putanec. The response from these
executives should lay to rest for you the issue of whether this was a
marketing ploy or not. Moreover, some of their answers give insight into
the company's grasp of the RMT market as a whole, and their chances of
success in the competitive MMOG genre. I encourage you to read on to see
how they've responded to our queries. Thanks to the Sparter execs for
their timely response.

will begin selling complete PCs, for the first time in the company's
history. The program is aimed at customers in India. 'Dubbed the IQ PC,
the machines will cost RS21,000 (about $525), are manufactured in
partnership with Zenith, and will sport AMD Athlon CPUs. ... In some
ways, the move to sell hardware is a natural extension of Microsoft's
low-cost Windows initiative ... It may also be a response to projects
like Intel's Classmate PC and the OLPC XO.' The Ars Technica summary is
careful to state that they seriously doubt this will lead to Microsoft
selling PCs in the US, yet the question must be asked: After Microsoft
mice and keyboards, then the XBOX and Zune, Microsoft is increasingly
becoming a hardware vendor. Is it only a question of time before
Microsoft starts to compete directly with the likes of Dell and HP?"

1up is carrying [0]the sad story of Justin Lowe. Just your average gamer,
wanting to partake of the current generation of consoles. He's got a PSP,
DS, PS3, and a 360. He really likes his 360 ... which is probably a good
thing, since he's sent 11 of them back to Microsoft. He's now on his
twelfth. The piece covers Justin's ongoing plight, and discusses
Microsoft's claims of hardware failures being a 'vocal minority'. "Justin
has not had a working system for longer than a month or two. The list of
problems is almost comically large: three red lights of death, two with
disc read errors, two dead on arrival, several with random audio and
video-related issues and one that actually exploded. Looking at the
situation through Moore's own standards, how has Microsoft performed? 'On
a scale of one to ten, I'd rate them an 8... at first,' says Lowe. His
[first] 360 broke in early January, just a few weeks after purchase."

knocking mid-range GeForce 8 series cards off people's shopping lists.
There's more to a graphics card than price; performance and driver
functionality are key too. [1]HEXUS had some fun and games testing the
new Radeons: 'The hardware designers may now be sitting back, content
that their DX10-supporting midrange SKUs are at least as compelling as
the competition's. But, and it's a big, big but, the current drivers
aren't realizing the kind of performance we'd expect from a knowledge of
the Radeon HD 2600 XT's setup.'" A very useful article ... unfortunately

an aggressive email, IM or text message' and 'having a rumor spread about
them online'. While the concept of cyberbully has been [2]around in the
US for a while, most coverage of the issue has focused on [3]more extreme
examples abroad. It would seem young people in the US are fully adapting
to the anonymity of online interactions."

| Ban On Price Floors Abandoned, Internet Prices May Rise            |

paro12 and i_like_spam informed us of a 5-4 decision by the US Supreme
Court which [0]abandons a 96-year-old ban on manufacturers and retailers
setting price floors for products. The Slashdot community [1]discussed
the issue when the case was argued back in March. The ruling means that
anti-competitive complaints based on price-fixing will have to be argued
case-by-case and will be harder to prove. Discounts and discounters in
all venues may be under pressure, with [2]internet sales possibly the
hardest hit. "Importantly, this case points a dagger at the heart of the
most consumer-friendly aspects of the Internet. The Internet has shifted
power to the consumer in two ways. First, it allows consumers to search
for and gather information in a cost-effective, efficient manner. Second,
it provides a low-cost means of retailing, making it easy for discounters
to offer products to the public. This combination squeezes excess profits
and inefficiencies out of product prices. Retail price maintenance seeks
to short circuit this extremely consumer friendly process. By setting
minimum prices, manufacturers can build in excess margins for themselves
and for their favored retailers -- prices that consumers have no choice
but to pay."

best. As it turns out Google and Yahoo! win hands down, proving that even
on the Internet it's all about branding."

| National ID May Have Killed Immigration Bill                       |

News.com reports that the immigration reform bill bouncing around in the
Senate for the last few weeks has finally been defeated. The site
speculates that, perhaps, one of the reasons it was finally defeated was
a measure intended to [0]expand the use of Real ID cards. If passed, the
bill would have effectively turned the Real ID system into a National ID
card. "The American Civil Liberties Union, another longtime foe of Real
ID, said the Real ID requirements were a 'poison pill that derailed this
bill, and any future legislation should be written knowing the American
people won't swallow it.' Another section of the immigration bill would
have given $1.5 billion to state officials to pay for Real ID compliance.
Even if the immigration bill is goes nowhere, however, the Real ID Act is
still in effect. It says, starting on May 11, 2008, Americans will need a
federally-approved ID card to travel on an airplane, open a bank account,
collect Social Security payments or take advantage of nearly any
government service." As we've discussed before, [1]several states have
rebelled against the implementation of Real ID.

[0]Riding with Robots writes "After months of scoping out the terrain,
the robotic geologist [1]Opportunity is ready to drive down into Victoria
Crater on the Meridiani Plains of Mars. Mission managers acknowledge the
hardy rover may never come back out, but say they think the potential for
discovery is worth it. 'The rover has operated more than 12 times longer
than its originally intended 90 days. The scientific allure is the chance
to examine and investigate the compositions and textures of exposed
materials in the crater's depths for clues about ancient, wet
environments. As the rover travels farther down the slope, it will be
able to examine increasingly older rocks in the exposed walls of the
crater. '"
