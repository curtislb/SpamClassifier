No, but the US government has the right to enforce its laws and other 
countries have the right to respond in kind.  Germany, for example, has 
claimed universal jurisdiction for the purposes of human rights violations...  
of course, the U.S. would never turn over one of it's citizens to such a 
court.  Are you sure your government will stand up for you if the U.S. comes 
calling?  Is it worth the risk?

Well, that's all fine and good.  However, if you were to pass yourself off as 
a lawyer and give legal advice to Americans from your home country, I would 
think it would only be a matter of time before Interpol would come looking 
for you with a one-way extradition ticket to the U.S.

Ah, but Sklyarov chose to do what he did from American soil, so not really a 
great example.  For the record, I protested in front of the Seattle Adobe 
building when that all went down, so don't think I'm some sort of corporate 
suit wearing dude here.

I don't think that's what being said.  But I also don't advise you stand on 
your side of the border shooting bullets into another country and then 
declare "I'm not in your country so I don't have to abide by your laws!"
