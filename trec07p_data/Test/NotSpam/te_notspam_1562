I don't think so. The advertising clause was highly impractical. I don't 
see informing users of their legal rights as being impractical.

I don't see that at all. Where does it say that the ALNs have to be 
compulsorily presented to the user at each run, or even once? The 
ability to display them merely has to be "convenient and prominently 
visible".

How can having the equivalent of a Help | About menu item ever be a cost 
to functionality?

One of the good things about the GPLv3 version of this requirement is 
that you do not have to preserve the _mechanism_ for displaying ALNs. If 
you acquire some software with a GUI interface where the ALNs are 
presented as the background image to the main GUI window, then you can 
switch them to Help | About without any problems. The text focuses on 
policy, not mechanism.

How so?

Why does voice-communicating software have any further problems? The 
ALNs can be read out at the user's request.
