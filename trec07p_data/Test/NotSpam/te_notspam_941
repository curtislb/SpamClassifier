"The requirement to add a notice became obsolete and essentially
deprecated on August 23, 2000, as every country that was a member of
the Buenos Aires Convention (which is the only copyright treaty
requiring this notice to be used) is also a member of the Berne
Convention which requires protection be granted without any formality
of notice of copyright."

All rights reserved has pretty much no legal effect now.
