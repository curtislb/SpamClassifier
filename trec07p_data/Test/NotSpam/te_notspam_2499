That's not one of perl's error messages, so I'm guessing it's coming
from either SWF::Builder or some other software you've got that I
don't.

If you say so. But have you ever been able to get the "sample
provided" to work properly? I've seen plenty of sample software that
didn't work as advertised. It used to work that way, you see, with an
earlier version of the frobnicator, but we don't keep the sample code
up to date any longer....

In any case, have you considered that maybe, somewhere around line 1
of something, you need to add a semicolon or otherwise adjust some
piece of non-Perl syntax?

SWF::Builder looks complex enough that it probably needs a FAQ and a
mailing list, if it doesn't have those already. But this is a Perl
Beginners' forum; although it's possible that somebody here knows how
to help you, it's much more likely that you'll get the best help most
quickly by tracking down the experts on SWF::Builder, wherever they
hang out. You may even need to ask the module's author for
clarification.

But maybe you access the Flash Authoring Environment Classpath the
same way whether you use SWF::Builder or not. In that case, your help
would come from the analogous set of experts, FAQ, and mailing lists
for that programming environment. But as they are likely to be more
numerous than the crew for SWF::Builder, they are similarly likely to
have a well-established presence on the net, so finding them will be
all the easier.

Good luck with it!
