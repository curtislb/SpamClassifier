Mmmh, I take note: disclaimers are useless.

I was merely giving my own lay-person opinion about what I think would
be the correct interpretation of a clause in a legal document (after
having explicitly stated that I am not a lawyer).
I'm having a hard time in believing that this is considered providing
legal advice, in Italy or elsewhere...

If only lawyers in their own jurisdictions are legally allowed to give
such answers to questions directed to debian-legal, then I'm afraid the
Debian Project should shut this list down ASAP.  Or, at least,
explicitly warn that only lawyers (certified to practice law in *every*
jurisdiction reached by Debian mailing lists!) are allowed to provide
answers.  At that point, I think that most threads would become
single-message...  :-(

The description[1] of the list states:

| debian-legal mailing list
| Copyright, licensing and patent issues
|
| Discussions about legality issues such as copyrights, patents etc.
|
| This list is not moderated; posting is allowed by anyone.

[1] http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/

I have never had the expectation that answers on debian-legal were being
given (only) by actual lawyers.  Maybe I have strange expectations or
lack thereof...

Mmmmh, I take note: disclaimers are useful.

Now, I wonder: if IANAL disclaimers are useless, why HINAL (He Is Not A
Lawyer) disclaimers are useful?!?

Puzzled.
