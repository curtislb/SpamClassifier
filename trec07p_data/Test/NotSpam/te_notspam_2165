It's not retroactive. Right now you are free to choose to use
any "GPLv2 or later" software under GPLv3. However any past use
under GPLv2 remains covered under GPLv2 only. You can't say *now*
that your copying *last year* was actually allowed under GPLv3.

The MS/Novell deal is actually grandfathered by this date.
That was the whole point of including that date. That was discussed
when discussion drafts 3 and 4 came out.
