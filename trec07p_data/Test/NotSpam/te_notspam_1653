On the other hand, without this, there would be the legal questions of 
runing GPL software on your web server,
when you do not own the server. (I think that some colo-facilities work like 
this, and know that some hosting services work like this.)

I'm not really to concerned with people running modified GPL'ed programs on 
third party grid services,
as they could in theory do the same thing with an internal grid service if 
they had one. Ideally
they would release any useful changes anyway. If not it still does not seem 
like too big a deal (to me).
