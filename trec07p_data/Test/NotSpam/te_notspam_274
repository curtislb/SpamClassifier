Like others have said on the list here, it's one thing to make a
profit but another to gouge with huge margins.  I keep hearing "small
markets" and all that.  I like Spie Southerland's mention of
diversifying the market; expanding it to those without disabilities.
I remember when screen readers for DOS went down real low - something
like $200 or so and now the windows versions are around $1,000.  I
really don't think inflation has gone up all that much.  

One good example of reasonable pricing is the Cepstral voices.  You
can buy a single voice for $29 and even Software DECtalk from Fonix
sold for $50; I assume it still does?  That's not too out of line.
>From a philosophical standpoint, I prefer the open source / free
software model - look at gnu/linux, but these other guys who don't
have anything else to sell, they might need the closed software model.

One point of greed from my point of view would be Access Solutions
refusing to publicize the specs for their USB synths.  Just think,
they could publish the specs and as a result the units could be more
easily used on more platforms.  That means more sales in my book.  You
would think that would be a no-brainer for any company but so many
companies are stupid about this.  I mean look at Apple and the Ipod;
they don't want anyone to be compatible with it!
