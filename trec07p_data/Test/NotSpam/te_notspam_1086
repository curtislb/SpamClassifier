Hi Peter,

thank you very much for your feedback.

As for your observations, I do realize that I'm using 1.5 chunks for  
this particular case (10e6 gives around 8 chunks on other sets).

I just noticed that I didn't add the difference in the deviances that  
I observed:

m1$deviance-m2$deviance
[1] -93196.69

Thank you very much for the suggestion, I'll give it a try.

Best,
benilton
