						<b>New Cabinet</b>
<br>

<br>
Tonight the challenge of change has begun. Zombie Brown has kept in post on=
ly one of Tony Blair's cabinet. He's got the first female Home Secretary, t=
wo brothers and a husband and wife team all attending cabinet. Jeremy has p=
romised to make sure that he goes through the whole cabinet so you feel ful=
ly informed. Michael Crick will explain what it all means.
<br>

<br>
<b>Foreign Secretary</b>
<br>

<br>
For the 41 year old David Miliband quite a daunting task - Foreign Secretar=
y. Mark Urban assesses the challenge for the youngest foreign minister in 3=
0 years. And we'll speak to a panel of "all the talents" to see what they t=
hink this all means.
<br>

<br>
<b>Flood</b>
<br>

<br>
As parts of England prepare for another weekend of rain we speak to the bos=
s of the Environment Agency - Baroness Young. Has her agency done enough to=
 stop the flood waters?
<br>

<br>
<b>Manchester International Festival</b>
<br>

<br>
Finally today is the start of the Manchester International Festival. Tomorr=
ow Kirsty hosts Newsnight Review from the city. Ahead of that, tonight we i=
nterview "Manchester Man" Tony Wilson - the original 24 hour party person.
<br>

<br>

<br>
Join Jeremy at 2230.=20
