I was looking into the cost of braille displays a few weeks ago and was 
shocked at the prices. But what makes you think these prices are out of 
line? I mean, maybe it just costs that much per unit because of the low 
volume. If you figure in R&D costs, support costs, and manufacturing costs, 
maybe it just costs that much. If not, then why doesn't somebody put out a 
$1000 braille display and wipe out the competition?

Admittedly, I can see a point on the other side too. We all believe in 
capitalism but corporations exist in the real world too. There is an ethical 
contradiction in our society where corporations get legal status as a person 
but nobody  expects them to act morrally. In  fact, in some circles, if you 
say corporations should behave as if they have a concience, you're passed 
off as a crazy liberal.

We don't praise a human being for devoting all of his time and all of his 
energy toward making money. But the mere suggestion that a corporation might 
devote some of it's resources toward something other than making money is 
considered crazy. But if a corporation is going to be given the right to 
free speech, for example, then why is it unfair to expect it to have a 
concience as well?
