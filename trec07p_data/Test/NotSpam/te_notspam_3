A lot of the good ideas on designing user-friendly console interfaces are
getting lost because today's programmers either work with a gui or they are
nerdy enough to cope with the cryptic unix command-line.

My husband restores old hardware, the way some people restore ancient cars.
I've gotten to play with lots of old operating systems, and many, like
Tops20, are a lot less cryptic than unix.

To get ideas about how to implement console interfaces in old-fashioned
operating systems, you might want to play with the fully accessible simh
	http://simh.trailing-edge.com

Which is a simulator for old hardware. I've run simh on both linux and
windows. 

Using simh I recently installed and played with RSTS/E on a simulated
PDP-1170. Very fun and gives you a broader perspective.
