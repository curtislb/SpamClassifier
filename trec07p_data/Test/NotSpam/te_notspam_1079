Hello Everyone-

I'm working for LIGASIDA and the Fundacion Henry Ardila (AIDS Groups)
in Bogota Colombia for the summer.  Folks here are very concerned about
the Colombia FTA but don't really understand the risks.  Is there any
analysis yet of the new Peru agreement?  The old one appears almost
identical to the Colombia one, so I imagine they will be similar.
Perhaps there are opportunities for the Colombia activists to have
input when the Colombian gov reviews and approves the US changes.
Thanks!
