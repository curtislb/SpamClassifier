Sometimes it's difficult to debug what's in your CGI
environment. That's what Inside is for:

Since the function comes from the module, it's documented in the module:

    perldoc CGI

Maybe that code doesn't work for you because you're not printing HTML,
like your header claims you are. You could change the type in the
header to 'text/plain', or you could change the output section. Have
you tried running it from the command line? Doing that is described in
the CGI module's documentation.

Also, of course, the usual admonitions to 'use strict', 'use
warnings', and so on.

Hope this helps!
