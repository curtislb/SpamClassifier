Hi folks

The problem was that the files I'm reading are generated on M$ servers in DOS 
format.

This meant that at the end of the file is a line containing the DOS EOF char 
^Z.  Using grep to remove this before reading the file has fixed the problem.

The error's gone and my program continues as it should.

Thanks for your help.

Gary
