Well, I have decided, in the past year, to do my best to market open-source 
products to my clients, rather than the expensive screen-readers.
Only when the open-source does not do the job, will I promote the expensive 
screen-readers.

"Mercury SGD is our dedicated communication device, approved by
Medicare and other insurance programs as a speech-generating device."

Approved by medicare for over $7000. This is what I mean.
If you look at the big picture, there is more going on than what
you observe in prices and such. Such prices would not be even
thinkable without the fact that it's "covered" which means some
people will have them, most will not, and if the market really
was free then the prices would be dramatically lower.
