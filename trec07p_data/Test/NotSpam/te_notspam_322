Right John,

I agree but have to disagree too.  I have started helping for the first time 
a site that I run software for my router off of.  It is called www.xwrt.org 
they make a web interface for Wrt project which can be found at 
http://www.openwrt.org.  But working for instance with a wiki is a bit of a 
trick.  That seems to be about how 90% (percent) of the open source docs are 
kept.  Now as for speakup, I do not use Speakup I do all admin chores 
remotely through a Windows computer which works fine for me.  So as for 
Speakup I don't use it but like to keep current on it.   I don't know how to 
program in Linux at all.  I don't expect Kirk to do everything either but it 
is very good to voice.  That might just be how the Speakup gets changed at 
some point.  I myself would like to see Speakup in the kernel and user space 
we would have the best of both world.

TTFN,

Scott
