						<div class=3D"GreyHeading">BORIS BECKER AT THE WIMBLEDON CHAMPIONSHIP=
S</div>
						<div>It's great to be back commentating at Wimbledon after missing la=
st year to work on the World Cup in my homeland, Germany.
<br>

<br>
A lot has been made of the outfits that I've been wearing this week.=20
<br>

<br>
I have been kitted out with some very fetching designs as I'm fronting a ca=
mpaign for a well-known clothing manufacturer at Wimbledon.
<br>

<br>
I've had no input into the design of them - I know my limitations and they =
are the experts!
<br>

<br>
I wish a few of my former colleagues would go for a makeover.
<br>

<br>
They've got to realise that they are no longer 25 and their playing days ar=
e over.=20
<br>

<br>
I'm not naming any names, but they know who they are!
<br>

<br>
One person exempt from this is Sue Barker.=20
<br>

<br>
Her dress sense is excellent and she gets better every year - like a fine w=
ine.
<br>

<br>
Onto the tennis, and four-time champion Roger Federer is the clear-cut favo=
urite.=20
<br>

<br>
It's not going to be a walk in the park for him as there are a couple of yo=
ung players that are coming on now, headed of course by Rafael Nadal.
<br>

<br>
The women's singles is far more open than the men's.=20
<br>

<br>
Justine Henin has just won the French Open and definitely has a strong chan=
ce of winning here.
<br>

<br>
She lost in the final to Ameile Mauresmo last year, but the defending champ=
 hasn't been fully fit for the last couple of months so Henin could get her=
 revenge.=20
<br>

<br>
But then there is Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova as well - it really i=
s so open and anyone could win it.
<br>

<br>
Enjoy the rest of the Championships,
<br>

<br>
Boris
<br>

<br>
<b>Boris Becker and John McEnroe, who each won three Wimbledon men's single=
s titles, are BBC TV's main pundits at this year's championships.<b/>
