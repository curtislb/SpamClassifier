This seems to suggest that the terms that you wrote explicitly have some 
special trumping value over the terms in the text of the GPL itself. I 
don't think that's true.

Here's a thought experiment:

Suppose I wrote some software, and wrote it to a CD, erasing all other 
copies. I then wrote out, in longhand, the text of the GPLv3 on paper, 
and attached it to the CD, and gave it to you. This software would 
clearly be under the GPLv3, and you could redistribute it under those terms.

Now suppose the same situation, except that I also wrote an extra 
restriction at the bottom: "Also, if you copy and distribute this code, 
you must send me a postcard."

Now, a bit of the text I wrote out in my own handwriting earlier says 
that if I put any extra restrictions on, you can ignore them. I quite 
clearly wrote that you can - it's there, in my own handwriting. So you 
can surely choose to do exactly that.

Why does the same logic not apply when the text of the GPLv3 was not 
typed out or written by you, but just added to your software distribution?

Now, if I specifically disclaim section 7 in my additional text, then 
that's perhaps different. But that would just demonstrate that my intent 
was to confuse :-)

But the GPL _is_ the intent of the licensor. You know this, because they 
start with "I license this code under the terms of the GPL(v3)..."
