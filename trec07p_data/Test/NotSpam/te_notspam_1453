Thanks for Spencer and Simon's help.  I've got very interesting
results based on your suggestions.

One more question,  how to handle unequal variance problme in lm()?
Isn't the weights option also, which means weighted least squares,
right?  Can you give me an example of setting this parameter in lm()
to account for  different variance assumption in each group?

Thanks again,
Shirley
