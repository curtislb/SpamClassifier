     Can you still use a mouse?  gpm offers it's own paste buffer, if 
you're able to use it.  Wish I could offer more idearz.  Might be easier 
to write a keyboard mouse module for gpm.  I just wish I could config 
the blasted thing for guest users here who might wanna use X11.  They're 
certainly not gonna want to use the shell prompt. <snickering>
