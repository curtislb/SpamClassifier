You really ought to just get the latest 2.6.21.x  kernel and build it from 
scratch that way.  It may take some tweeking but you'll thank yourself in 
the end.  Good experience.
If you plan on updating your kernel frequently, get the linux-2.6.21.tar.bz2 
file along with the latest patch for that kernel, like linux-2.6.21.5.patch 
and apply it.  Then, when a new patchlevel comes out, get that new patch, 
linux-2.6.21.6.patch, unapply the patchlevel 5 patch and apply 6.
