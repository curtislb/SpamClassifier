No, debian-installer needs to be able to work irrespective of the state of=
=20
specific mirrors because otherwise the installer would always need to be=20
rebuilt _after_ a release has already happened, which is not acceptable.

We have already applied a fix (#422442) in the installer that when=20
installing from CD, it will always install the codename that is on the CD=20
instead of installing the suite corresponding to that codename.
So, if you install an Etch CD, you will get Etch, even if the mirror still=
=20
lists Etch as "testing".

See also #418382, which would make selecting a release for non-CD based=20
installs a bit more clear.

Closing this report as there is nothing further that can be done about=20
this in the installer and the issue reported originally was resolved.

Cheers,
=46JP
