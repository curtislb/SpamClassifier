Dear Cabot Wealth Advisory Reader,

On Sunday I watched the Boston Red Sox lose to the Texas Rangers by one
run, as part of the 345th consecutive sellout crowd in Fenway Park.  My
son put away a hot dog, a bag of peanuts and an ice cream, while I stuck
to peanuts and beer (at $7 a cup).

Before the game, a group of Navy Seals parachuted in and a girl from Maine
sang the national anthem.  In the middle of the game, she came out again
and sang God Bless America.  I felt like an American.

Today I'm playing my clarinet with a neighborhood band in the local Fourth
of July parade, which features both patriotic kids on red-white-and-blue
homemade floats and intoxicated adults pushing the boundaries of taste in
floats that address current events in a humorous fashion.  Odds are that
likenesses of both Scooter Libby and Hillary Clinton will appear this
year.

I'll feel American all day.

And tomorrow I'll be back at work, studying charts of both the market and
individual stocks, and then thinking about which stocks have the potential
to keep on running . . . and which ones to write to you about on
Thursday.

And even then I'll feel like an American.

Because investing is what has helped to build America.  For most
Americans, the first investment is a house, and that's great because while
it appreciates, you can live in it, and avoid paying rent.   

It's tax-deductible, too.

But the sooner you get around to investing in stocks the better, for both
you and your country.  For your country, because your dollars, properly
used, support growing businesses.

And for you because, well, it's your future, and if you don't prepare for
it properly, you can hardly expect anyone else to, including your own
government.

Amateurs like to think that investing is about getting rich quick, but
wiser minds know that it's about guaranteeing yourself a comfortable
retirement.   And the sooner you start the better.

Now, maybe you're already well down that path.  If so, I apologize for
boring you with the basics.  But if you've yet to begin, I urge you to
start now.

And I urge you to take a no-risk trial subscription to Cabot Stock of the
Month to help you make those all-important buy-hold-sell decisions in the
months and years ahead.

Cabot Stock of the Month, you see, is unique among Cabot products because
it practices Spectrum Investing, picking and choosing stocks from all
other Cabot publications.

When blue-chip growth stocks are leading the pack, Cabot Stock of the
Month will steer you to them.  When Chinese and Indian stocks are hot, it
will be there, too.  And when the market's at risk, it will serve up a
perfect low-risk undervalued stock.

In the long run, the publication will help you build a portfolio that will
help ensure your comfortable retirement.  And that's what it's all about.

I've got a special trial rate for first time subscribers.  To get started,
simply click the link below.

P.S.  Remember, the sooner you start the better.  The July Stock of the Month is
in one of my favorite sectors, education, and it's already up 15% since we
recommended it last week!
