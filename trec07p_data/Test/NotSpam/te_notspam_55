  My $0.02 is that it's a corner case.  If you're trying to merge to
trees, then:

  a) history is important, so you should merge that, too
OR
  b) history isn't important, in which case "diff/patch" are OK

  That's a real plus.

  Mercurial has an initial implementation of partial pulls, without
syncing the whole history.

  I don't know about other systems.
