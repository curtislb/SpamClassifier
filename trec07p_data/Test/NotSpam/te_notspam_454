ALERT:
USDA IGNORES PUBLIC REJECTION OF PROPOOSAL TO ALLOW 38 NON-ORGANIC INGREDIE=
NTS & TOXIC FISH OIL IN FOODS LABELED AS "USDA ORGANIC"
Basically ignoring more than ten thousand emails and letters from consumers=
 and farmers opposing the latest industry-sponsored attack on organic stand=
ards, the USDA has approved a proposal allowing 38 new non-organic ingredie=
nts to be allowed in products bearing the "USDA Organic" seal. But the agen=
cy says this may just be interim approval, and has offered to extend the pu=
blic comment period another 60 days (the original public comment period was=
 only 7 days). The USDA's controversial proposal will result in the followi=
ng:

* Anheuser Busch will be allowed to sell its "Organic Wild Hops Beer" witho=
ut using any organic hops at all.
* Sausages, brats, and breakfast links labeled as "USDA Organic" will be al=
lowed to contain intestines from factory farmed animals raised on chemicall=
y grown feed, synthetic hormones, slaughterhouse waste, and antibiotics.
* Products labeled as "USDA Organic" and containing fish oil may contain to=
xins such as PCBs and mercury.

DIALING FOR ORGANIC DOLLARS
Each year, Working Assets Long Distance (WALD) Company donates a portion of=
 its revenue to national non-profitsdoing front line work on progressive is=
sues, such as the Organic Consumers Association (OCA), . If you are a curre=
nt Working Assets customer, you can help the OCA receive a portion of these=
 funds by sending a quick online letter, nominating the OCA for donations. =
Thanks! WALD customers vote for OCA here: http://www.workingassets.com/voti=
ng/

QUICK FACTS OF THE WEEK: CORN-BASED ETHANOL ADDS TO GLOBAL FOOD CRISIS

* In the past 12 months, the global corn price has doubled.
* Because corn is the most common animal feed, this affects the price of mi=
lk, cheese, eggs, meat, as well as corn-based sweeteners and cereals.
* In the U.S., milk prices have nearly doubled.
* Butter prices in Europe have spiked by 40%.
* Pork prices in China are up 20%.
* In Mexico there have been riots in response to a 60% rise in the cost of =
tortillas.
* In six of the past seven years, global grain consumption has exceeded pro=
duction. As a result world grain reserves have dwindled to 57 days. This is=
 the lowest level of grain reserves in 34 years.
* While the UN lists 34 countries as needing food aid, 30% of next year's g=
rain harvest in the U.S. will be converted to ethanol to fuel cars.

QUOTE OF THE WEEK:
"The stage is now set for direct competition for grain between the 800 mill=
ion people who own automobiles, and the world's 2 billion poorest people."

Lester Brown from the Earth Policy Institute speaking at a briefing to the =
US Senate two weeks ago.

___________________________________

SOLUTION OF THE WEEK: FEED THE HUNGRY AT THE GAS PUMP

* Automakers roughly doubled the fuel economy of cars between the 1970s and=
 the late 1980s. In other words, the "know-how" has been here for a long ti=
me.
* Over the past 20 years, automakers have used advancements in technology t=
o add more than 800 pounds to the average vehicle and nearly double horsepo=
wer, while fuel economy has declined. Be smart about what you drive.
* The grain required to fill a 25 gallon gas tank with ethanol would feed o=
ne person for a year. Every time you fill your tank, think about biking, wa=
lking, mass transit or just relaxing at home. Live simply so that others ma=
y live.
* Next year, 30% of U.S. corn will be used for ethanol. Instead, the same a=
mount of fuel could be saved by increasing average fuel efficiency by just =
three miles per gallon. Let your Representatives and Senators know that you=
 support strong fuel efficiency standards and a wholesale conversion of U.S=
. transportation, utilities, and agriculture to renewable sources of energy=
..Take part in OCA's Farm Bill alert below.

__________________

ALERT:THE 2007 FARM BILL SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE OR CORPORATE WELFARE
Congress is currently drafting a new Farm Bill, legislation that will deter=
mine agriculture policy for the next five years. Will it be more corporate =
welfare for polluting agribusiness or new incentives for farmers to provide=
 healthy and affordable food while protecting farmworkers and the environme=
nt? Unfortunately, the bill that the House Agriculture Committee is working=
 on is looking a lot more like the former. Please write Congress in support=
 of sustainable agriculture: http://www.organicconsumers.org/articles/artic=
le_5813.cfm

___________________________________

NAIS ALERT: KEEP 'BIG BROTHER' OUT OF FARM BILL
Industrial agriculture lobbyists have been pushing for a National Animal Id=
entification System (NAIS) for several years. The proposed NAIS program wou=
ld require every person who owns a farm animal, even if it's just one chick=
en or a pet horse, to register their "property" with the federal government=
, identify each animal (in most cases with implanted microchips or other el=
ectronic identification), and report their movements on a national database=
. This program would impose particularly heavy burdens on family farmers wh=
o raise animals on pasture, while giving further competitive advantage to f=
actory farms. The House Committee on Agriculture is considering a provision=
 in the massive 2007 Farm Bill that would implement NAIS. The House Committ=
ee on Agriculture will vote on the bill July 12, so time is of the essence.=

WEB VIDEO OF THE WEEK: SOIL IS ONE SECRET SOLUTION TO GLOBAL WARMING
Can organic farming fight climate change? Yes. And we're not just talking a=
bout food miles. Research from the Rodale Institute shows that sustainably-=
farmed soil absorbs 30% more carbon than conventional agriculture, and swit=
ching our farmland to organic would cut greenhouse emissions by 10% in the =
US (20% in Canada and most of the rest of the world). For a concise explana=
tion of how organic farming could be a major tool in the fight against clim=
ate change check out the 10 minute online video "SOIL: The Secret Solution =
to Global Warming," featuring Canadian farmer Percy Schmeiser. The website =
includes an online petition calling on world leaders to switch subsidies fr=
om conventional to sustainable farming practices. Learn more and watch: htt=
