If I were sure it does this and only this, then I would be more than
happy it is explicitly permitted.
The problem, as I explained, is that I am afraid that broader
interpretations are possible...

Yes, that is exactly what I expressed: the disappointment that
GPL-compatibility is no longer a DFSG-compliance guarantee.
Some restrictions that can be legally added to a GPLv3'd work will make
the work non-free, so we have to check on a case-by-case basis...  :-(

OK, maybe "author attribution" is clear enough, but I'm still worried
about the so-called "reasonable legal notices"...

Well, in the case of the GNU GPL v3, it can be argued that the license
does *not* forbid this!  And it could even be the correct interpretation
of the license!

That's exactly what I was complaining about!

I can be agnostic about copyleft, but adopting a license which is almost
twice as long and complicated as the GPLv2 (which, in its turn, is
definitely not a short and simple one!) and getting a weak copyleft
sounds kinda awkward!
When I do not want copyleft I adopt a simple non-copyleft license!

$ wc /usr/share/common-licenses/BSD /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-2 \
  GPL-v3_text.txt=20
   26   225  1499 /usr/share/common-licenses/BSD
  340  2968 17992 /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-2
  676  5644 35068 GPL-v3_text.txt
 1042  8837 54559 total

Imagine this: I adopt an overly complicated license which is about 25
times longer than the 3-clause BSD, and still my code can be
proprietarized!  Wow!  :-(

Indeed.


P.S.: please do not Cc: me, as long as you reply to debian-legal:
      I didn't ask you to do so; thanks
