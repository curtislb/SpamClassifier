An anonymous reader writes "Apparently Microsoft still hasn't learned
that counting vendor acknowledged vulnerabilities isn't a good way to
establish the security of an OS. As an [0]analysis of Microsoft's claims
on Full Disclosure shows, we see that the methodology used was badly
flawed. A bug in Firefox (not to mention emacs), counts as a flaw for
Linux, while [1]IE bugs get ignored on Vista's chart. Then we see that
vulnerabilities aren't vulnerabilities when they're security-challenged
features such as [2]Vista's Teredo. Also, there's far too little
consideration given to severity, given that it stoops to counting even
extra access restrictions on a file in OSX to have something to show. In
short, the original Microsoft analysis was good PR and poor research."

Chris writes "German scientists have [0]succeeded in snipping HIV out of
human cells after it has integrated itself into a patient's DNA. The
procedure is a breakthrough in bio-technology and fuels hope of a cure
for AIDS. The group is only cautiously optimistic, though, as treating a
full-on infection would be substantially different than succeeding in a
controlled lab environment. 'Researchers ... began with the bacterial
enzyme Cre recombinase, which exchanges any two pieces of DNA flanked on
either end by a certain pattern of nucleotides (DNA subunits) known as
loxP. HIV does not naturally contain loxP sites, so the team created a
hybrid of the two DNA molecules, which they used to select a series of
mutated Cre enzymes that were increasingly able to recognize the combined
DNA. The final enzyme, Tre, removed all traces of HIV from cultured human
cervical cells after about three months, the researchers report online
today in Science.'"

[0]ElvaWSJ writes with a link to a Wall Street Journal [1]interview with
Steve Jobs and AT&T's CEO Randall Stephenson. As you can imagine, they're
pretty enthusiastic. Just the same, they address the possibility that the
iPhone will slow internet access on Ma Bell's cell network. "Mr. Jobs
acknowledged that the company's new iPhone won't surf the Internet as
fast as he would like on the network, called "Edge," but added that the
device's ability to connect to Wi-Fi hotspots would give consumers a
speedier alternative for Web browsing. For his part, Mr. Stephenson said
the iPhone represents a broader push by AT&T into Wi-Fi services,
including, potentially, mobile Internet calling. The two men also
discussed the iPod's "halo effect" and reflected on the origins of their
corporate partnership."

[0]coondoggie writes us with a link to the Network World site, as he
tends to do. Today he offers an article discussing the cancellation of a
presentation which would have [1]undermined chip-based security on PCs.
Scheduled during the Black Hat USA 2007 event, the event's briefing
promised to break the Trusted Computing Group's module, as well as
Vista's Bitlocker. Live demos were to be included. The presenters pulled
the event, and have no interest in discussing the subject any more.
"[Presenters Nitin and Vipin Kumar's] promised exploit would be a chink
in the armor of hardware-based system integrity that [trusted platform
module] (TPM) is designed to ensure. TPM is also a key component of
Trusted Computing Group's architecture for network access control (NAC).
TPM would create a unique value or hash of all the steps of a computer's
boot sequence that would represent the particular state of that machine,
according to Steve Hanna, co-chair of TCG's NAC effort."

how to bring together metadata to make the world a more searchable place.
'All entities - everything from the particular chair I am sitting on to
objects like the Lincoln Memorial monument should have a unique digital
identifier. As an example - let's start with people. I don't know if
darren@yahoo.com is the same as darren@gmail.com. There is a problem of
managing identity across the internet, so when I say Darren Waters I mean
this person and all of the manifestations and representations and
personas of that person. The ability to knit those together is a huge
challenge and opportunity for us as an industry. That's what I mean by
resolving people - I mean this person and not the likely thousands of
other people who share your name.'"

resulting from unauthorized Internet banking transactions rests with the
customer if they have 'used a computer or device that does not have

date, [or] failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that the protective
systems, such as virus scanning, firewall, antispyware, operating system

all the other artists who may be tempted to dally with the Mail on

artist be able to give away his own music if he wants to without fear of
industry retaliation?"

| Microsoft to Simplify Downgrades From Vista to XP                  |

castrox writes "Microsoft has noted that [0]many corporate users want to
run XP instead of Vista. They are now simplifying the downgrade process
for top OEMs. Currently, all OEMs must call Microsoft whenever a
downgrade is done. After the new procedure is put into place, OEMs may
submit batches of keys to Microsoft online. According to the Microsoft
blog on ZDNet, the 'downgrade software' will still need to be supplied by
the end user. The deal is rather perplexing — it does not seem like you
can convert the license since the only eligible versions for downgrading
is Ultimate and Business. The company has [1]more details available in a
pdf document online."

MrErlenmeyer writes "Many injuries and diseases including heart attacks,
stroke, and Parkinson's cause healthy cells to kill themselves. A group
of scientists at Washington University in Saint Louis believe they have a
lead on [0]how to stop apoptosis (unwanted cell suicide) and thus
minimize the tissue damage that occurs as a result of these injuries.
They designed drugs that halt the actions of executioner caspases,
proteins that act as a molecular wrecking crew. Other scientists had
found that a chemical called isatin could prevent tissue damage in rabbit
hearts that were deprived of oxygen. This was the starting point for the
team of researchers in Missouri. By making some changes to the molecule,
they were able to develop an even more effective molecule. With some
further refinement, this may lead to a new class of emergency
medications."

kungfoofairy writes "Russia has laid claim to over [0]one million square
kilometers of the Artic. This announcement comes on the return of a
scientific expedition into the region which found that the [1]Lomonosov
Ridge connects to Russia. The area is supposed to have a reserve of 10
billion tons of natural gas and oil. '[2]A BBC map shows Russia's
proposal; [3]this set of maps from The New York Times illustrates the
area at stake and different ways it might be divided ... The Russians
have tried to advance their claim before, and were turned away by the
United Nations in 2001. The new geological data is evidently meant to
improve the odds for a second try. '"

An anonymous reader writes "Rumors said the release wouldn't be until
late Q4 but [0]an August ship date is now promised for AMD's quad-core
chips. They're only releasing up to 2.0 GHz processors at first, with the
top speed devices coming out later in the year. 'AMD's Barcelona puts
four cores on a single slice of silicon, an approach AMD calls native
quad-core, and the company has argued that Barcelona will outperform the
Xeon 5300. The only problem: that comparison soon will become obsolete.
Intel's second-generation quad-core server processors, Harpertown a
server member of Intel's Penryn family, will arrive this year, too, with
the promise of better performance, lower power consumption and lower
manufacturing costs by virtue of a manufacturing process with
45-nanometer features. AMD is only just now moving to a 65-nanometer
process.'"

whipped up a handy video to explain the concept."
