   The greatest thing about Viagra is the security that
   you are on "automatic pilot", relaxed, carefree, with no worries about
   a sudden
   loss of erectile powers, no matter what kind of interruptions
   (kids knocking at door, dog barking, ill-fitting condom) may be thrown
   your way.

   Worried about the loss of erection??
   Give Viagra a go.
   You'll get a hard and lasting erection and plenty of orgasms for your
   lady.



   But if, on account of regrettable circumstances, the proof
   disappeared, he would find himself once more in the same position as
   when he passed the Brazilian frontier--the position of a man who came
   to say, Here is my past life; here is my present; here is an entirely
   honest existence of work and devotion which I bring you.You passed on
   me at first an erroneous judgment. After twenty-three years of exile I
   have come to give myself up! Here I am; judge me again! The death of
   Torres, the impossibility of reading the document found on him, had
   thus not produced on Joam Dacosta the impression which it had on his
   children, his friends, his household, and all who were interested in
   him. I have faith in my innocence, he repeated to Yaquita, as I have
   faith in God. If my life is still useful to my people, and a miracle
   is necessary to save me, that miracle will be performed; if not, I
   shall die! God alone is my judge!
   On his death-bed, about the middle of February, 1827, he said to young
   Gerhard von Breuning, on receiving Handels works: Handel is the
   greatest and ablest of all composers; from him I can still learn.Bring
   me the books! (Fall of 1823, to J. A. Stumpff, harp maker of London,
   who acted very nobly toward Beethoven in his last days. It was he who
   rejoiced the dying composer by sending him the forty volumes of
   Handels works (see 111). ) [Cipriani Potter, to A. W. T. , February
   27, 1861. Beethoven used to walk across the fields to Vienna very
   often. B. would stop, look about and express his love for nature. One
   day Potter asked: Who is the greatest living composer, yourself
   excepted? Beethoven seemed puzzled for a moment, and then exclaimed:
   Cherubini! Potter went on: And of dead authors? B. --He had always
   considered Mozart as such, but since he had been made acquainted with
   Handel he put him at the head. From A. W. Thayers notebook, reprinted
   in Music and Manners in the Classical Period, page 208. H.
