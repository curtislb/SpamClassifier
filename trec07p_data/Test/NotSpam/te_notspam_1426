This just looks wrong...  Looks like you are trying to create a sorted
group of tickets from the original data.

I personally would be using a Database,  loading it in if necessary and
then doing a simple select:

select action_creator, ticket_customer, ticket_number, ticket_subject
from my_table
order by action_creator, ticket_customer, ticket_number, ticket_subject

In fact the whole thing looks like a database application waiting to
happen.
