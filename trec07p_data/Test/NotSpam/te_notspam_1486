Hi Chris,

thanks for your reply. When I first read it I thought "he wants me to
rtfm. great reply". I have (and also read) your book and done my fare
share of basic cifs auth coding. I know the davenport site, but I didnt
know the ms link. That one was nice, and finally helped me find the
solution.

Where winxp(and earlier) uses the plaintext --(DES)--> LM hash
--(DES)--> Ntlm hash scheme, Win2k3 uses the passwords md4 hash
--(DES)--> Ntlm hash. So the first step is different, the second is not.

What really confused me is that winxp and win2k3 sent exactly the same
packet, but a different password hash, and both actually worked.

Thanks for pointing that ms link out to me. It's sunday night and I
spent many hours on this problem this weekend. Seeing it solved before
the time ran out(too busy during the week) made my day(well, night).
