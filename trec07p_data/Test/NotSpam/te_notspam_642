I'm trying to do the following:

I want to search for a specific file/s in my current dir and when it finds
it, print its contents. So I did the following:

#!/usr/bin/perl

opendir(CURRENT,".");
@list = readdir(CURRENT);
closedir(CURRENT);

foreach $item (@list){
   if($item =~ /notes/){


open(FILE,"@item");
@file = <FILE>;
while(<FILE>){ print };
close(FILE);

print "@file\n";
}
}

I keep getting the following error:

In string, @item now must be written as \@item at ./obj14-2.pl line 11, near
"@item"
Execution of ./obj14-2.pl aborted due to compilation errors.

So I changed the script:

#!/usr/bin/perl

opendir(CURRENT,".");
@list = readdir(CURRENT);
closedir(CURRENT);

foreach $item (@list){
   if($item =~ /messages/){


open(FILE,"\@item");  #NOTE THE \
@file = <FILE>;
while(<FILE>){ print };
close(FILE);

print "@file\n";
}
}

I don't get any output. The file for sure exists.

Any ideas on what I'm doing wrong?
