You need the base too.

>is? Seems to me to be a big jump. Does 25a have all of the changes

Yup.

>needed between 10 and 25a? I've never installed samba and don't know

You can remove the old version *AFTER* you've performed the upgrade. If you're looking for continuity between versions, you'll need

smbpasswd
secrets.tdb
winb*.tdb
account_policy.tdb
group_mapping.tdb

Unless, of course, you're setup for LDAP, then you should only need:

secrets.tdb
account_policy.tdb

But don't throw anything away until you know that your environment is still working as expected.

You may also want to review the release notes on the Samba site since a *lot* has changed over the last 15+ updates. :-)
