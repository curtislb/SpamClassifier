Except that he wasn't. Reading the complaint and indictment would be a
reasonable first start before complaining about American megalomania.
[Otherwise you're indulging in the American pastime of rushing to
judgement.]

In addition to the demonstration, the server from which the ebook
processer was distributed was located within the US, as was the
payment processing stuff. You can't distribute goods in a country and
remain free from being indicted when those goods violate the laws of a
country, the sanity of the country's laws notwithstanding.

Regardless, we're wildly OT for -legal.
