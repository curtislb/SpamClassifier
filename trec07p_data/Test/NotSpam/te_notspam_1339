Hiya,
    I don't think so.  The server seems to have a lot of stuff already on 
it...An Apache web server, Postfix, etc.  I'm just a bit overwhelmed by the 
idea of doing the whole website thing.  I'm not creating anything too 
elaborate, but I did contemplate the idea of starting up a small personal 
mud or the like.  The possibilities just seem rather endless now that I have 
the domain.
Thanks,
Zack.
