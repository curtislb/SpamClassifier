I was under the impression that the Dectalk Express problems with 2.6.20 
and newer kernels had been fixed.  However, I just noticed this near the 
top of the Slackware change log for Slackware current.

kernels/speakup.s/:  Backed up speakup to CVS 2007-03-03 and recompiled.
   I'm hoping this fixes a DecTalk Express problem.
   Thanks to Stephen C. Greeley for all the help debugging this.
