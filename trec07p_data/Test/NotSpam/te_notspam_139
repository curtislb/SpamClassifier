Do you think it would take longer to learn the basics of Perl 
necessary for that script than it took to reimplement the hundred 
lines of well performing Perl as a thousand lines of slow Java?

Visit the boss, show him the two programs printed out (so that he can 
compare the length ... that's I guess about all he can understand), 
tell him how long did each of them take to write and how long does 
each take to process the file and then ask him whether he's really 
sure that it's more efficient to waste time with Java or to teach one 
more guy some Perl.

Eager? I'd expect them to forget about trying to make it quicker 
because they know the've failed to compete many times already and 
concentrate on the reasons why Perl should be banned instead.
