  Dear Sir:
   
  I watched the video of the brutal treatment of the 13 year old skateboarder. I want to express my utter dismay at the way this officer handled the situation.
   
  I live in Florida and this "power trip" mentality displayed by this officer was responsible for the death of a 14 year old named boy Martin Lee Anderson. He was beaten to death by the "Boot Camp Guards." This was caught on video for all Floridians as well as all of the nation to see.
   
  I believe in law and order and I understand the concept of public safety. I did not see anything this boy did that would provoke such a heavy handed response from an officer.
   
  In the ranks of the police and in the ranks of prison guards, their are some that are attracted to these positions because they particularly enjoy the POWER to control, brutalize, attack, and abuse people. I do not know your hiring practices and what role psychological screening plays in the hiring of police officers. I believe that law enforcement and all "corrections" HR have a public duty to screen out these personality types. This would prevent tragic deaths (like Martin Lee Anderson) and enhance public safety. How do you think these kids perceive law enforcement after witnessing this arrest?
   
  Unless I am uninformed, we are not YET living in a police state. Law Enforcement has the responsibility to "serve and protect" but in a manner that is respectful and does not use more force than is required in any given situation. 
   
   
  Sincerely,
   
   
  Chrystal Weaver
