Are you saying that somebody has decided to give the US government the 
right to rule the world?

I don't give a monkeys about American criminal law, because I don't live 
there. And I have no desire to visit there.

And what would you do about the Sklyarov affair? What he did was 
criminal under US law, I agree. But under Russian law (the law of his 
local jurisdiction) it was MANDATORY!

You're basically claiming that if American law flatly contradicts the 
law of some other country, then people living in that country have to 
ignore their own law and abide by American law instead !!!

Cheers,
Wol
