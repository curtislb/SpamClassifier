Local minima, other than the actual roots, will be present only when the
Jacobian of the system is singular.  If the Jacobian is well-behaved then
there should be no problem, although this is hard to verify in practice.
Furthermore, as I had pointed out in one of my previous emails, if
convergence to a local optimum takes place, you simply restart the procedure
with another initial value.

Ravi.

This seems useful, but it is important to note that the approach may not 
work well
unless the system of nonlinear equations is very well behaved and a good 
starting
point is chosen. A good explanation of the problems with this exact 
approach, that
is adding up the sums of squares of the individual functions,  is described
in Numerical Recipes for C, second edition, p 382 (see 
http://www.nrbook.com/a/bookcpdf.php)
Briefly there will often be a great number of local minima even when 
there is only a single
root of the original equations.
