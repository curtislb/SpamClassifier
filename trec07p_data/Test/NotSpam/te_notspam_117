XML::LibXML is also a good one for general xml parsing/manipulation.

Hi Mike,

XML::Twig would probably work fine, you can for example do XML::Twig->new(
twig_roots => { message => sub { push @messages, $_-
>text;  $_->purge;}, },)
               ->parsefile( 'file.xml');

message texts will be in @messages

If you need more information than just the text of the message elements,
then you can use twig_handlers instead of twig_roots, look at the docs for
the difference.

That said if the files are the size of your example, that's really small, so
there should be no need to switch from a module that loads the entire file
in memory. OTOH if message elements can contain mixed content (embedded
markup like <b> for example), then that would be a reason to avoid
XML::Simple.

I hope that helps.
