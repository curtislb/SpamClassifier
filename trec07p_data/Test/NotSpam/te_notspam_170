I would ask people spouting off in this thread to ask themselves what *they* 
have contributed. It seems to me that a lot of people are making suggestions 
for what other people should do or sell.

Say the best thing to do is to move speakup into user space. How is that 
going to get done? I guess we're all going to volunteer Kirk to do it. Eh?
