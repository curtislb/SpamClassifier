My guess is that there is a blank line at the end of your file. Orworse, some other white space and a newline.
Since Tie::Handle::CSV uses Text::CSV_XS internally, it requires verystrict files. Embedded newlines--and by extension trailingnewlines--can crash Text::CSV_XS. So will other malformed CSV.
Make sure that the last record in your file is correctly terminated(i.e. there are no unclosed quotes), and that the last record isfollowed immediately by the final newline, which is alos the lastcharacter of the file.
