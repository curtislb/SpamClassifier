cagrin writes "On Tuesday the UN's World Heritage Committee [0]added the
Galapagos Islands to the list of sites in danger from environmental
threats or overuse. From the article: 'The Galapagos Islands, an
Ecuadorian territory situated in the Pacific Ocean some 1,000 kilometers
(625 miles) from South America, helped shape Charles Darwin's theory of
evolution and in 1978 was the first site placed on UNESCO's World
Heritage List.' Here is some background from Sea Shepherd on the
[1]insults facing the Galapagos."

An anonymous reader suggests we stop over to ZDNet for a case where
Google may be stepping on the wrong side of that famous Don't Be Evil
line. A Google staffer is offering to [0]help the healthcare industry
contain the damage that Michael Moore's film is about to do. (Here is the
original [1]Google Health Advertisement blog post by Lauren Turner; in
case it disappears, it is reproduced in full in the ZDNet post.) Quoting
from the Google post: "Many of our clients face these issues; companies
come to us hoping we can help them better manage their reputations
through 'Get the Facts' or issue management campaigns. Your brand or
corporate site may already have these informational assets, but can users
easily find them? We can place text ads, video ads, and rich media ads in
paid search results or in relevant websites within our ever-expanding
content network. Whatever the problem, Google can act as a platform for
educating the public and promoting your message. We help you connect your
company's assets while helping users find the information they seek."

they are waiting on 'legal department approval.'"

+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

Zack Melich writes with news of a new front about to open in the war
printer manufacturers wage with cartridge counterfeiters, refillers, and
hardware hackers. A San Francisco company, Cryptography Research Inc., is
[0]designing a crypto chip to marry cartridges to printers. There's no
word so far that any printer manufacturer has committed to using it.
Quoting: "The company's chips use cryptography designed to make it harder
for printers to use off-brand and counterfeit cartridges. CRI plans to
create a secure chip that will allow only certain ink cartridges to
communicate with certain printers. CRI also said that the chip will be
designed that so large portions of it will have no decipherable
structure, a feature that would thwart someone attempting to
reverse-engineer the chip by examining it under a microscope to determine
how it works. 'You can see 95 percent of the [chip's] grid and you still
don't know how it works,' said Kit Rodgers, CRI's vice president of
business development. Its chip generates a separate, random code for each
ink cartridge, thus requiring a would-be hacker to break every successive
cartridge's code to make use of the cartridge."

What makes ScienceHack unique is that every video is screened by a

ScienceHack focuses on many topics including physics, chemistry and

ScienceHack has none of that. ScienceHack currently supports videos from
YouTube, Google videos and Metacafe."

navigate through your notebook's files, applications, etc. the same way
you can on the iPhone. (Yes, I know you can already scroll with them,
that's nothing new. I'm talking about all the other finger gestures that
can be done on the iPhone's screen) On June 20th, CrunchGear reported,
"The upcoming MacBooks will be about half the thickness of current models

plastics/materials"."

Commission has [0]fumbled the Network Neutrality Act, again, as of this
past week. However, the FTC defended its actions saying that their
decision was not a give-in to the big telecom and cable companies.
Instead, the FTC report [1]urges caution on Network Neutrality
Regulation. While this news is disappointing, the FTC's decision appears
to be thought out and a message to remind people to not let the subject
of Net Neutrality be abandoned by the general public so corporations
could undermine the interest of consumers. We discussed [2]the row this
created, but with constant [3]stalling tactics being employed here how
long will it be before net neutrality opponents craft their own
legislation?"

Dr. Eggman writes "According to an article on Ars Technica and its
accompanying General Relativity and Gravitation journal article '[0]The
Return of a Static Universe and the End of Cosmology', in the far future
of the universe all evidence of the origin of the universe will be gone.
Intelligences alive 100-billion-years from now will observe a universe
that appears much the way our early 1900s view of the universe was:
Static, had always been there, and consisted of little more than our own
galaxy and a islands of matter. 'The cosmic microwave background, which
has provided our most detailed understanding of the Big Bang, will also
be gone. Its wavelength will have been shifted to a full meter, and its
intensity will drop by 12 orders of magnitude. Even before then, however,
the frequency will reach that of the interstellar plasma and be buried in
the noise--the stuff of the universe itself will mask the evidence of its
origin. Other evidence for the Big Bang comes from the amount of
deuterium and helium isotopes in the universe.'"
