[0]DigDuality writes with an [0]explanation of the silence of the Show Us
the Code initiative. The push he began — to gather influential sponsors
demanding that Steve Ballmer reveal what Linux code he believed to be
infringing Microsoft patents — was [1]discussed here last February. "[2]Show
Us the Code has been silent since March 23. May came and went — the
deadline allotted for calling Ballmer's bluff — but the site gave no
update. I [0]now explain the silence. After a scheduled interview with
Forbes columnist Dan Lyons didn't happen, and my place of employment
falsely accused me of representing that they endorsed my own political
goals, I decided it was best to shut my mouth so I would be able to keep
paying my bills. I'm glad to see Linus now publicly echoing the
sentiments that this site espoused. Maybe someone already accustomed to
the limelight will have better luck in challenging Microsoft's FUD
machine."

An anonymous reader writes to describe a [0]newly declassified window
film from CPFilms Inc. that could give war drivers fits. Scientific
American has the story, which includes a rather dismissive comment by
Bruce Schneier. "Once manufactured under an exclusive contract with the
US government, this recently declassified window film is now available to
the public. But don't expect to see it on store shelves anytime soon.
Currently, it's only available directly from the manufacturer, and at
prices that will likely make it prohibitive for all but the wealthiest
home owners. The two-millimeter-thick coating can block Wi-Fi signals,
cell phone transmissions, even the near-infrared, yet is almost
transparent... It can keep signals in (preventing attempts to spy on
electronic communications) or out, minimizing radio interference and even
the fabled electronics-destroying electromagnetic pulse generated by a
nuclear blast."

Ohreally_factor takes us back to Friday when both the iPhone and the
GPLv3 were released. "This article at Tectonic suggests that [0]Apple's
iPhone might run afoul of the GPL. Peter Brown, executive director of the
FSF is quoted as saying: 'Today, Steve Jobs and Apple release a product
crippled with proprietary software and digital restrictions: crippled,
because a device that isn't under the control of its owner works against
the interests of its owner. We know that Apple has built its operating
system, OS X, and its web browser Safari, using GPL-covered work — it
will be interesting to see to what extent the iPhone uses GPLed
software.' Might there really be GPLed code in the iPhone? It's well
known that OS X built on BSD, which of course uses the BSD license.
Webkit is based on KHTML which uses the LGPL."

[0]Ian Lamont writes "The IT department of the state government of
[1]Massachusetts has designated Microsoft's Office Open XML as an open
document format, along with ODF, plain text, and HTML. It's only a draft
policy, but it sets the stage for the format being given an official
stamp of approval by state authorities — and weakens earlier
Massachusetts support for the Open Document Format. Microsoft got a big
boost at the end of 2006 when Ecma approved OOXML, and again this spring
when [2]pro-ODF legislation was being defeated or watered down in six
states."

whether improper tactics were used to suppress competition and persuade

major Hollywood studios except Universal are backing Blu-ray; Universal
is backing HD-DVD. It also notes that while one industry watcher believes
the first format to have an installed base of two million homes will come
out on top, there were millions of Betamax units already sold when VHS
won out in the format wars of the 80's."

escalated when Oracle filed its March 22 lawsuit claiming SAP workers

[0]athloi alerts us to an opinion piece running in USA Today on the
[1]backlash against an effective tool to fight identity theft. The big
three credit bureaus don't like the numerous state laws that have been
passed requiring them to give consumers a simple way to freeze their
credit. Watch for a push at the federal level to get a watered-down
statute that pre-empts state laws. "Lawmakers across the country — pushed
by consumer advocacy groups — ... have passed laws that allow consumers
to freeze their credit, a surefire way to prevent thieves from opening
new accounts or obtaining a mortgage in a consumer's name. Under a
freeze, a consumer cuts off all access to his credit report and score,
even his own. All lenders require that information, so no one can borrow
money in the consumer's name until he or she lifts the freeze. It's
simple, and it works. So, of course, it's under threat from the Consumer
Data Industry Association, which represents the Big Three credit bureaus.
They make millions gathering and selling consumer data. Freezes cut into
that business."

An anonymous reader notes that InfoWorld is covering a survey of North
American developers that claims that Linux is gaining share as the
[0]number of developers targeting Windows fell 11 percent over the last
year. [1]Evans Data has been conducting these surveys of client, server,
and Web developers since 1998. Evans Data says that the arrival of
Windows Vista likely only kept the numbers from being even worse. The big
gainer wasn't developing for a Web platform, but rather for Linux and
"nontraditional client devices." Windows is still dominant, with 65% of
developers writing code for this platform. Linux stands at almost 12%, up
from 8% a year earlier. The article says that Evans Data collected
information on Mac and Unix development but did not include them in this
year's report.

[0]coondoggie alerts us to research out of Ohio State University that
could help authorities [1]respond to car accidents more quickly and ease
traffic back-ups at lower cost, particularly in rural areas. The software
improves the efficiency of communications from in-road vehicle detection
loops to transportation engineers monitoring conditions in order to
improve traffic flow. Faster response to accidents and traffic jams could
have huge payoffs: a 2002 study estimated that traffic jams cost the
average city almost a billion dollars a year.

MsManhattan writes "Sony has filed for a US patent on a [0]liquid-filled
airbag that cushions hard disks from heavy shocks in portable electronic
devices. 'The liquid used could be water or silicon oil,' and 'the
electronics would of course be in a liquid-tight case.' Sony expects to
use the technology in mobile devices such as cameras, media players,
smartphones, and laptops." The article mentions a clever approach Sony
has come up with to handle shocks of varying intensity.

[0]Craig writes "The [1]2007 installment of RoboCup has begun; individual
events opened to the public today. [2]RoboCup is an international
robotics symposium and competition whose goal is to advance the fields of
robotics and artificial intelligence to the point that in 2050 a robot
soccer team can defeat the human world champions. This year, RoboCup is
located on the Georgia Tech campus in Atlanta, GA, marking the first time
a university is hosting it and only the second time since it began in
1993 that it is located in the United States."

CoolBeans writes "Making ethanol is easy. Making enough ethanol to fill
every gas tank in a developed country is tricky. The Department of Energy
has promised $125 million to the [0]Joint BioEnergy Institute, a team of
six national labs and universities that will be run like a startup
company. They intend to [1]create new life forms that are optimized for
alcohol production. The genes of crops that produce large amounts of
cellulose will be tweaked to improve the yield per acre and to increase
drought and pest resistance. Microbes that produce sugar from cellulose
and ethanol from sugar will be built for speed and efficiency." The
article mentions as an aside that earlier this year, "the energy giant BP
gave $500 million to Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley lab, and the University
of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign for similar alternative energy research.
That gift will fund the Energy Biosciences Institute, which will operate
separately from the JBEI." So UC Berkeley and LBL are both participating
in two separate energy-biotech research programs.

| Ocarina of Time &mdash; Best Game Ever?                            |

[0] The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is the best game yet made,
according to a list compiled by readers and writers of the lauded British
gaming magazine Edge. Their list of [1]the hundred best games ever is
top-heavy with Nintendo titles, a full five out of the top ten being
released to a Nintendo platform. Obviously, this sort of thing can get
contentious, and CNet's Crave blog [2]spoke up quickly with a contrary
opinion. "The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is truly a masterpiece
that should be thought of as one of the greatest games ever created. But
to call it the greatest game of all time is a serious misstatement.
Unlike Super Mario Bros., Ocarina of Time was released in an era where
video games were booming and sales were on the rise. Simply put, everyone
was playing video games, and the game was the best of its time. But no
other game in history--Ocarina of Time included--was able to save an
entire industry from almost guaranteed destruction the way Super Mario
Bros. did, and it is for this reason that we should all give ol' Mario
and Luigi credit where it's due." Let's hear it, then. What game deserves
to top a list of the 100 best games ever made?
