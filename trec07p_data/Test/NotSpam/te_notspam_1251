The gateway is two way, but you need to register with Marco d'Itri's
linux-gate service at
http://lists.bofh.it/listinfo/linux-gate
- you should have been told that by your newsserver, IIRC.

Alternatively, save the message to a file, strip the X-Original- parts
from some headers and delete the original Date, References and Message-Id.
With sed, I think it's something like this:

#!/bin/sed -f
1i\
>From news  Thu Mar 22 12:59:12 2007
/^\(Date\|References\|Message-Id\)/I,/^\([A-Z]\|$\)/d
/^X-Original-/s///

Then open that as a mailbox and you should be able to reply properly.

Hope that helps,
