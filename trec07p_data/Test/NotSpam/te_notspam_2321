The --maintainer option exists so that people who want to modify the lexer and 
parser of IMCC can do so.  However, the source tree contains the resulting 
generated files.  This means that it's not a requirement to have a lex or 
yacc to build Parrot.

I suppose the theory is that most people don't need to modify the IMCC parser 
and lexer.  Certainly I lived several happy years without doing so.
