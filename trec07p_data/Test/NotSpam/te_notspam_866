Thanks to the four distinguished R'ers who answered. I have used  
Sweave intensively for over a year, and have poured through all the  
doc. as well as the help archives, and could find nothing on this. It  
is now "well known" to me! since it bit me, but it did cost me a day  
of head-scratching and putting it in the shortest possible form for  
the list (the original example where this happened was a lot more  
complicated). Perhaps it could be documented in Sweave- 
manual-20060104.pdf or its successor?

Now I see the reasoning behind it, thanks. I had already determined  
the work-around. The problem is that I distribute the Tangled .R  
files along with the Sweaved PDF doc, so that students etc. can run  
the code. Anything unintuitive in the code confuses people. In this  
case I think it's good pratice to delete temporary variables right  
after they are no longer needed (as in my original example), so  
that's why I want to put it in the same chunk.

Having said that, I am a Sweave devotee, it has radically improved my  
productivity in writing R-based tech. notes.
