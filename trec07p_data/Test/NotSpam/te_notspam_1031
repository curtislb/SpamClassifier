I missed that entirely.  I was groggier than I
realised yesterday afternoon. I had at least once left
nts in existance in the same environment where ukn is
called, thus getting an intermitant error. In that
environment nts$cda was named!

Yes.  I had already tried calling it within the ukn
environment not realising that I had not named the
elements so this was my last try.

Oops, typo when creating the simple example.  Sorry.

This has been very helpful though I still do not
understand why one must call nts$cda using the
eval(parse()) command.  Is it because nts is created
within the ukn environment?  

I have had a look at S-Poetry but will need to spend a
lot more time on this.  

I thought that this was not the best way to do things
but I wanted to avoid doing a lot of earlier
manipulations to my data files and so decided to go
with what I had.
