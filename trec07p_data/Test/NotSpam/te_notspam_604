Luckily I am an upstream author and also plan to add some Debian only
features, like suggestions by combining popcon and detags data. As
mentioned in a previous mail before I included some distribution
specific hooks.

But I am not sure about tasksel. It doesn't operate on the abstraction
level of applications. Since tasksel doesn't allow to uninstall all
packages of a task (but perhaps this could be implemented by using apt's
new automatically installed status) it belongs more into the installer.
There was support for tasksel in Synaptic some time ago, that is
currently disabled. But the could should still be there.

Cheers,

Sebastian
