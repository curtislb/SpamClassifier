How long a time frame is planned to give application developers time to 
port/adjust/extend their applications to work with the APIs, security 
system etc?

Is there time allocated for regression testing?

We (the Squeakers) already have a hard time keeping up with changing 
APIs, launch sequences etc. And to make life even more interesting 
things like the need to extract the DBus Activity Protocol from the 
source code.

Is there a plan for central/country specific server locations where 
content can be hosted? Or do activity providers like etoys or Sophie 
also need to provide content hosting?

So many questions :-)

Michael
