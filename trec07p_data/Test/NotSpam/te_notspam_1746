Mark,

What you are referring to deals with the selection of covariates, since PC
doesn't do dimensionality reduction in the sense of covariate selection.
But what Mark is asking for is to identify how much each data point
contributes to individual PCs.  I don't think that Mark's query makes much
sense, unless he meant to ask: which individuals have high/low scores on
PC1/PC2.  Here are some comments that may be tangentially related to Mark's
question:

1.  If one is worried about a few data points contributing heavily to the
estimation of PCs, then one can use robust PCA, for example, using robust
covariance matrices.  MASS has some tools for this.
2.  The "biplot" for the first 2 PCs can give some insights
3. PCs, especially, the last few PCs, can be used to identify "outliers".
  
Hope this is helpful,
Ravi.

Hi James,

Have a look at Cadima et al.'s subselect package [Cadima worked with/was a
student of Prof Jolliffe, one of _the_ experts on PCA; Jolliffe devotes part
of a Chapter to this question in his text (Principal Component Analysis,
pub. Springer)].  Then you should look at psychometric stuff: a good place
to start would be Professor Revelle's psych package.

BestR,
Mark.
