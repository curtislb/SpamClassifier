Hi all,

Thanks for your replies.

Bhaskar: I cannot switch to the terminal with Alt+F1 or any other virtual
terminal for that.

Kevin: I used the raw (low-level) program s2disk and s2ram for it but they
do the same thing as the powersave script, which additionally removes some
kernel modules.

Joe: I installed hibernate, but with the same result. May be you can suggest
me the configs you made for making it work for you.

regards,
Hardik
