I think the Bazaar model is a bit easier to understand than the git
one, especially for people coming from (for example) Subversion. The
UI is also much nicer. For example, there's no need to worry about sha1s as a
regular user and the commands make a little bit more sense. It's usable 
easily in a centralized fashion. 

Git's data format and representation are intermixed - there's no way
of upgrading the repository format without changing the revision ids,
as they are checksums tied to the format. Bazaar has infrastructure
for upgrading to newer formats and thus can support things like nested
trees in the future without breaking everybody's existing branches. 

Git is really fast and efficient at what it is supposed to do: merge between
and store snapshots of code on POSIX systems. It does not aim to do
more than that; for example, win32 will be tricky to get fast because it 
relies on platform-specific features and its heavy integration with
the current data format means it's hard to add new features such as nested 
trees. Bazaar is trying to be more generic.

bzr's smart server improves performance significantly, especially for 
high-latency connections. The fact that all of Samba's history has to 
be transmitted makes that its still slow.

I've never really understood what's so nice about fast-forwards or
rebasing. What's so useful about it?

Yeah, I have to agree with these. The speed and RAM usage of git are

Not sure about svn2bzr.py, but svn-import (similar command from
bzr-svn) does.

I think it was about half the size of the Samba Subversion repository
last time I tried it.  Obviously, it would be a lot less when lazy 
repositories would be supported.

It's high on the list for the summer. Most of the current focus is on
performance.

"bzr switch" changes the branch that is used by the current working
tree, much in the way you can do so with git. It doesn't change
directory or anything.
