I have had to do this before and it is possible iff both machines are
using the same OS at the same version/patch level.  It is easier if
you download and build the modules by hand (rather than try to use
CPAN).  Just get the module to the point of "make install" and copy
the directory over.  Just make sure you install any dependencies
first.  Oh, another gotcha is that since some Perl modules rely on
extrenal libraries you need to make sure the two systems have all of
the same libraries installed.
