now it works.

auto and allow-hotplug didn't work on my box.

This is my solution (for all others having the same trouble):

I modified /etc/network/interfaces this way:

iface eth2 inet dhcp
wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.mynet.conf
#auto eth2

and in /etc/rc.local:

Etch-nb:~# cat /etc/rc.local
#!/bin/sh -e
#
# rc.local
#
# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.
# Make sure that the script will "exit 0" on success or any other
# value on error.
#
# In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution
# bits.
#
# By default this script does nothing.


ifup --verbose eth2
exit 0

This configuration makes the machine connecting to my WLAN at the first try 
without any errors. :-)))

Thank you Frank and Freddy!

Regards
Michael
