Hi all,

Richard Stallman will be in Ontario next week talking about "Copyright
vs. Community."

Mississauga - http://www.fsf.org/events/20070705/view
Waterloo - http://www.fsf.org/events/waterloo20070706/view

"Copyright developed in the age of the printing press, and was
designed to fit with the system of centralized copying imposed by the
printing press. But the copyright system does not fit well with
computer networks, and only draconian punishments can enforce it. The
global corporations that profit from copyright are lobbying for
draconian punishments, and to increase their copyright powers, while
suppressing public access to technology. But if we seriously hope to
serve the only legitimate purpose of copyright—to promote progress,
for the benefit of the public—then we must make changes in the other
direction."

Details regarding the Mississauga event are pending.

- Scott.

their ingenious design for checks and balances, and their belief that
the rule of reason is the natural sovereign of a free people." - Al
