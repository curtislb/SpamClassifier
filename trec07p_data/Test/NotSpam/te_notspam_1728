Hi,

I have installed the chat activity from the git repository
http://dev.laptop.org/git.do?p=chat-activity but I am having difficulty
running it because it appears that I am missing some select packages.  For
example, I receive errors for modules such as ActivityToolbox, Telepathy,
etc.  I installed python-telepathy and that seemed to help but I havent been
able to discover the rest of them.  Can someone please send me a list of all
the necessary packages.

I am trying to learn the code of the chat-activity to reuse some of the
models for a multiplayer portion of a learning game I am working on.  If
someone can suggest an alternative existing activity to learn this from that
would be helpful as well.  Thanks

~ Aneto
