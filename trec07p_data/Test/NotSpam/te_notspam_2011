I was thinking about making a few different scripts that would enable/
disable components of my laptop to save power,  I am hoping to be able
to just make a few different scripts that will be stored on my
desktop.  These scripts will just check to see if a specific component
is enabled or disabled, and then turn that component on or off.  I was
thinking this would be easier than having to go into device manager
every single time I wanted to start up a USB slot or something.  If
anyone knows of any module that I could use to be able to access the
device manager it would be alot of help.

Thanks for any replies,

Dustin
