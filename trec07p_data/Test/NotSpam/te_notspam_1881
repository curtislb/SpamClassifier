Hi guys

You guys have been giving me some very good ideas. Very efficent ways
of doing things.
For this excercise that I'm trying to figure out I actually need the
following inefficient way:



#!/usr/bin/perl

@array = (5,3,2,1,4);

## include your code here ##

foreach $elem (@array){
  print "$elem";
}

I need to sort the @array from lowest to highest using TWO loops and
ONE if statement. That's why it's so confusing.
I could use a one liner to do all this. I need to do it however as
above mentioned.

How can I do this?

Thanks for all your help

Amihai
