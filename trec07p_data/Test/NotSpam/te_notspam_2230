What do you mean by 'likes'? As far as I can see both will work, but neither will
do what you expect of them.

The hash solution has been mentioned, but it may be more appropriate to use
array references without the containing hash:

foreach my $vm (\@Exchange, \@Filter, \@DNS, \@Domain) {
  my_sub(@$vm);
  print "@$vm\n";
}

(I am calling the reference $vm because you did and it presumably means
something to you, unlike the rest of the world :)

HTH,

Rob
