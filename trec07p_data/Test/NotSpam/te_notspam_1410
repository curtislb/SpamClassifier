Now I'm unsure.  Earlier, the Program was defined as "any copyrightable
work licensed under this License".  Because the GPL is a copyleft, isn't
the modified Program also the Program?  Is 5d's work the original or
modified work?  Is 5d's Program the original or the modified Program?
I thought it was 'the work' [= work B] as mentioned in the first part of
5d.  It seems a bit fiddly for the work to change in 5 to mean the
modified work but the Program never to change.

To be fair, some people have tried to use GPLv2's requirements about
notices to include invariant sections.  I think this will be less common
and less troublesome than many licences.

No worries.  Thanks for the thorough analysis, flagging many potential
problems, even if I'm not convinced that there any DFSG-busters.
I'm very demotivated by the GPLv3 and the way it has been produced (not
sure which of this and FDL 1.2 was worse for me, to be frank) and it's
rather inescapable, so I probably wouldn't have looked so closely at it
without this thread you started.
