which pulled a decision out of thin air, ignoring problems = not fun.
In any case, wasn't that before the 2006-7 DPL term?

I think this is about Java-in-non-free?  Non-free is not fun IMO and
that happened as a fire-first, ignore policy about asking on debian-legal
and get legal advice later, which is also not fun.

where CC decided to tell us what debian believes.  Not fun, but when the
DPL shows such contempt, why wouldn't CC?

A draft does not fix bugs.  Maybe it will do when released.  FSF missed
various due dates, but DPL was curiously silent.  Not fun.

That draft is still in the terrible FSF Web-2.Null comments system,
which is also not fun.

> 	- a resolution on how we approach sourceless firmware

where we agreed to ignore some bugs, didn't we?  Necessary, but
not fun for most people.

> 	- Java licensed under the GPL

Announced and praised, but not done in 2006.  Not fun.

Still pending.  Still not fun.

*Actual* solutions instead of the above mix of pending, announced, draft
possible/maybe *future* solutions might have been fun.  If anyone found
the above events fun, that's disappointing if not surprising.  If a DPL
thinks all of the above were actual solutions, they're definitely in
the wrong business!

Hope that explains,
