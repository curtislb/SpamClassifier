XML Snip:
       <raiserisklevel>
        <message> ..... </message>
        <message> ..... </message>
       </raiserisklevel>

When using the 'twig_handlers' which may have multiple child elements, IE:

my $twig = new XML::Twig(twig_handlers => {raiserisklevel =>\&print_message});
$twig->parsefile('/path/to/xml_file');

sub print_message {
my($t,$elt) = @_;

my $message =  $elt->first_child('message')->text;

print qq~Message: $message

 $t->purge;
}

Will this print all the text within the message elements??

Mike
