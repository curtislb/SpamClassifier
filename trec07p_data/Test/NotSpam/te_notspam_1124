Pelosi, Hoyer, Rangel, and Levin Statement on Trade

Friday, June 29, 2007

Contact: Brendan Daly (Pelosi), 202-226-7616

Washington, D.C. – House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Majority Leader Steny
Hoyer, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charles Rangel, and Ways and
Means Trade Subcommittee Chairman Sander Levin issued the following
statement today on Democratic trade policy:

Peru and Panama

"The Peru-U.S. Free Trade Agreement that Peru’s legislature ratified
this week is an historic accomplishment in trade policy and in our
bilateral relationship with a strong friend in a region vital to U.S.
economic and national security. The agreement has great potential to
strengthen the economic ties between our two great countries and to
improve standards of living in both countries. It also reflects
long-standing Democratic priorities with the inclusion of enforceable,
internationally recognized labor rights and environmental standards.

"We have every expectation that, in the coming weeks, both the Peruvian
Parliament and U.S. Congress will do whatever it takes to make certain
that the agreement is implemented fully. In the United States, the
Constitution confers upon Congress the authority to regulate foreign
commerce under Article I, Section 8. In that regard, Chairman Rangel
intends to lead a bipartisan delegation of Members of Congress to Peru
and Panama this August to meet with representatives of those countries’
respective legislatures and executive branches, and to provide them the
opportunity to confer with Members of Congress.

"We are hopeful that this trip will lead to the swift passage this fall
in Peru and Panama of the necessary legislation to change laws and
implement fully the respective agreements, so these agreements can come
into effect promptly thereafter.

South Korea

"Tomorrow, the United States and the Republic of Korea will sign a free
trade agreement. Properly negotiated, a South Korea-U.S. FTA (KFTA)
would provide key benefits to American workers, farmers, and businesses.

"Unfortunately, the KFTA as currently negotiated is a missed
opportunity. The agreement does not address in an effective manner the
persistent problem of nontariff barriers, particularly those blocking
access of U.S. manufactured products in South Korea’s market. That is
particularly the case in the automotive sector where last year, South
Korea exported more than 700,000 cars into the U.S., while the United
States exported fewer than 5,000. These numbers illustrate deep-seated
and fundamental problems in market access and a heavily one-sided
trading relationship that can be expected only to undercut support for
the agreement far beyond the automotive sector.

"As a consequence, we cannot support the KFTA as currently negotiated.

Colombia

"With regard to the Colombia FTA, the House of Representatives recently
passed the 2008 State and Foreign Operations Appropriations bill, which
redirects U.S. foreign assistance in Colombia. All of us regard Colombia
as a crucial ally in a region that deserves our active engagement, and
the bill represents an effort to have U.S. funds help address the root
of numerous problems there. There is widespread concern in Congress
about the level of violence in Colombia, the impunity, the lack of
investigations and prosecutions, and the role of the paramilitary.
Issues of this nature cannot solely be resolved through language in a
trade agreement.

"We believe there must first be concrete evidence of sustained results
on the ground in Colombia, and Members of Congress will continue working
with all interested parties to help achieve this end before
consideration of any FTA. Consequently, we cannot support the Colombia
FTA at this time.

Trade Policy

"We will continue working to improve our trade policy, while at the same
time addressing the increased economic insecurity faced by American
families. We expect to move forward in the near future with legislation
to address the growing imbalance in trade with China, strengthen overall
enforcement of U.S. trade agreements and U.S. trade laws, as well as
overhaul and improve support to ensure that American workers and firms
remain the most competitive in the world.

"Our legislative priorities do not include the renewal of fast track
authority. Before that debate can even begin, we must expand the
benefits of globalization to all Americans, including taking the actions
outlined above. We hope that the Administration will join us in these
efforts."
