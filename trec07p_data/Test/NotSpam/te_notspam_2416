[0]NewYorkCountryLawyer writes "An elderly, non-file-sharing grandmother
from East Texas, who had been [1]sued by the RIAA after being displaced
by Hurricane Rita, has [2]sought leave to file counterclaims against the
RIAA record companies for [3]using unlicensed investigators. In her
[4]counterclaims (PDF) Ms. Crain claims that the record companies
'entered into an agreement with a private investigations company to
provide investigative services which led to the production of evidence to
be used in court against counterclaim plaintiff, including the
identification of an IP address on the basis of which counterclaim
defendants filed their suit... [They] were at the time of this agreement
aware that the aforementioned private investigations company was
unlicensed to conduct investigations in the State of Texas specifically,
and in other states as well... [T]hey agreed between themselves and
understood that unlicensed and unlawful investigations would take place
in order to provide evidence for this lawsuit, as well as thousands of
others as part of a mass litigation campaign... [T]he private
investigations company hired by plaintiffs engaged in one or more overt
acts of unlawful private investigation... Such actions constitute civil
conspiracy under Texas common law.'"

A number of readers made sure we know that [0]Bill Gates is apparently no
longer the world's richest person. His wealth, estimated currently at
$59.2 billion, has been surpassed by that of Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim.
Slim, the son of a Lebanese immigrant, runs businesses in a number of
industries from Mexico City. Stock in his wireless company, American
Movil, recently surged in price by 27%, boosting his net worth to $67.8
billion. Last April Slim passed Warren Buffet, who had long held down the
number 2 spot. In this audio Bill Gates [1]says he won't care when he is
no longer number 1.

Iron Condor writes "Massachusetts is the first state to [0]require its
residents to secure health insurance, a plan designed to get as close as
practically possible to statewide universal health care. Presidential
hopeful and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney originally
introduced the idea in 2004. Effective July 1, 2007, the law, which uses
federal and state tax dollars, is aimed at making health insurance
affordable to all residents of the state, including low-income
populations. Those who fall below the federal poverty line may be
eligible for health care at no cost."

Many users have written to tell us about a magnetic machine promising "[0]infinite
clean energy". Engadget has the first picture of the device and is
reporting that the announcement (along with a short video) of this
supposed device will be released later tonight. "CEO Sean McCarthy tells
SilconRepublic how it works. Namely, the time variance in magnetic fields
allows the Orbo platform to 'consistently produce power, going against
the law of conservation of energy which states that energy cannot be
created or destroyed.' He goes on to say 'It's too good to be true but it
is true. It will have such an impact on everything we do. The only
analogy I can give is if you had absolute proof that God wasn't real.'"
In my experience if something seems too good to be true it generally is.
I wouldn't get your hopes up.

TV, DVDs, the Internet and even cell phones ... but too little time to
watch it all? The Minisode Network has a solution. Launched in June as a
broadband channel on the MySpace site, it offers, for our streaming
pleasure, episodes of vintage Sony Pictures Television series like
'Silver Spoons,' 'Starsky & Hutch,' 'Diff'rent Strokes' and even Ricki
Lake's talk show."

on the surfaces of copper, iron, beryllium and other metals behave like
water on a lake's surface,' says Diaconescu, a postdoctoral research
associate in the Condensed Matter Group of the physics department at UNH.
'When a stone is thrown into a lake, waves spread radially in all
directions. A similar wave can be created by the electrons on a metal
surface when they are disturbed, for instance, by light.'"

thefickler writes "Media Defender, a company which does the dirty work
for the MPAA, [0]has been caught setting up 'dummy' websites in an
attempt to catch those who download copyrighted videos. The site,
MiiVi.com, complete with a user registration, forum, and "family filter",
offered complete downloads of movies and "fast and easy video downloading
all in one great site." But that's not all; MiiVi also offered client
software to speed up the downloading process. The only catch is, after it
was installed, it searched your computer for other copyrighted files and
reported back."
