Actually, YOU CAN'T.

The only person who can CHANGE the licence is the person who owns the 
copyright.

The recipient has the right to use code placed under a "v2 or later" 
licence AS IF it was under v3 - they do not have the right to re-licence 
it under v3.

I think you need to, though, because they ARE two DIFFERENT licencing 
criteria, and you do NOT have the right to change them.
