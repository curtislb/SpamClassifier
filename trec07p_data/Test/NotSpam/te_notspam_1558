Can we dub GPLv3 "GPL with the advertising clause" then?  And the
advertising clause is a lot, lot worse than for 4-clause BSD one -- instead
of just "advertising materials" which in free software there usually none,
GPLv3 forces us to vomit legal crap right in the face of every single user,
even at a cost to functionality.  While for GUI apps having an "About" menu
item is usually not an issue, legal notices are a significant burden for
console stuff, both full-screen and line-based.  And just think about
software which communicates using voice (hands-free things, for example).

Could the FSF be asked for an official statement?  Because if the
interpretation you mentioned is what they want, GPLv3 is SCARY.
