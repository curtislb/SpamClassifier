previously sued by the RIAA — which dropped the case just before losing a
summary judgement — is now [1]suing the RIAA and their hired snoop
Safenet for malicious prosecution. (Safenet was formerly known as
MediaSentry.) Anderson is asserting claims under the Computer Fraud and
Abuse Act and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act. A
reader at Groklaw has already picked up that she is seeking to have the
RIAA forfeit the copyrights in question as part of the settlement (search
the page for '18.6-7')."

teh_commodore writes "Scientific American is reporting that Google is now
[0]asking a Federal judge to extend the government's anti-trust oversight
of Microsoft, specifically with regard to desktop search software.
Microsoft had [1]already agreed to modify Vista to allow rival desktop
search engines, but Google says that this remedy will come too late —
specifically, after (most of) the anti-trust agreement expires in
November. What makes this political maneuver interesting is that Google
went over the heads of the Department of Justice and US state regulators,
who had found Microsoft's compromise acceptable, to appeal directly to
the Federal judge overseeing the anti-trust settlement." Update: 06/26
17:20 GMT by [2]KD : The judge is unwilling to play along with Google;
she said she will [3]likely defer to an agreement on desktop search
forged between Microsoft and the plaintiffs in the case: i.e. Justice and
the states.

mrnomas writes "What's to blame for the declining CD sales? Is it that
manufacturers are putting out more and more 'safe' (read: crap) music
while independent musicians are releasing online? Is it because iTunes is
now the third largest music retailer in the country? Or is it just that
[0]CDs are becoming obsolete?" Quoting: "Forbes.com [ran] an article
showing that [1]CD sales are expected to be down 20% in 2008 (slightly
higher than the 15% drop initially predicted). Why such a drop? What's
truly happening is a gradual shift away from physical media to
downloadable formats. What this indicates, so far, is that US sales of
digital music will be growing at an estimated rate of 28% in 2008,
however physical sales will drop even further, resulting in a net overall
decline.""

[0]TropicalCoder is the reader who submitted the story about the
[1]possible demise of LiftPort a couple of weeks back. The resulting
discussion was mostly negative about the feasibility of building a space
elevator. TropicalCoder writes: "At one point during the discussion,
LiftPort founder Michael J. Laine personally entered the discussion, but
for the most part remained invisible since he hadn't logged in. I
responded to his comment that if he would like a chance to rebut the
criticisms, he should contact me and I would undertake to interview him
and post the resulting story on Slashdot." Read below for the story of
how Mr. Laine's [2]detailed reply and rebuttal to that Slashdot
discussion came about. TropicalCoder asks, "After reading LiftPort's
rebuttal to Slashdot critics, do any of you now feel your pessimism
somewhat dispelled?"

[0]Spielas Roberts points out as "obvious Linux fodder" the coverage of a
study just published in PNAS claiming that, on fossil evidence, [1]giant
penguins once stalked the plains of Peru. One species goes back over 40
million years and its members were as large as modern king penguins. They
were warm adapted. Members of another species, 30 million years ago,
stood 5 feet high and made their living spearfishing with their 1-foot
beaks. Here's an [2]artist's impression.

Pisces writes "Over the past several days, Microsoft has [0]flip-flopped
on virtualization in Vista, with one [1]ascribing the change in policy to
concerns over DRM. A piece at Ars Technica raises another, more likely
possibility: [2]fear of Apple. Apple is technically an OEM, and could
offer copies of Vista at a discounted price. 'All of this paints a
picture in which Apple could use OEM pricing to offer Windows for its
Macs at greatly reduced prices and running in a VM. The latter is
absolutely crucial; telling users that they need to reboot into their
Windows OS isn't nearly as sexy as, say, Coherence in Parallels. If
you've never seen Coherence, it's quite amazing. You don't need to run
Windows apps in a VM window of Vista. Instead, the apps appear to run in
OS X itself, and the environment is (mostly) hidden away. VMWare also has
similar technology, dubbed Unity.' Is Microsoft terrified of a world
where Windows can be virtualized and forced to take a back seat to Mac OS
X or Linux?"

iTunes is required to enable the iPod/syncing functionality of the phone

this for those who only want the iPod functionality of iPhone, and
whether the iPhone is easily unlockable for those who wish to try it on
alternate carriers, and so on.)"

Next Generation is reporting that [0]Vista PC games have been cracked to
run under XP. Hacking groups who apparently wanted to play new titles
like Shadowrun and Halo 2 with driver support have taken it upon
themselves to open up the playing field a bit. "The news is sure to irk
Microsoft who may now face an increased delay in some consumers adopting
Vista at this early stage. However, it shouldn't come as a surprise.
Earlier this month Falling Leaf Systems said in a press release that it
believed Microsoft was deceiving consumers by stating that the titles
would only work on Vista, and announced its intentions to release
compatibility software to disprove the claim. 'Microsoft has, in typical
Microsoft fashion, decided to launch their forced migration onslaught in
full force with the release of two games that will only run on Windows
Vista,' said Falling Leaf Systems CEO Brian Thomason in the press
release." Relatedly, Mitch Gitelman of the (now closed) FASA Studios has
[1]taken exception to negative reviews of Shadowrun.

product called 'iPlayer'. This iPlayer is not yet available for platforms
other than MS Windows, [0]which caused the Open Source Consortium (OSC)

its content as widely available as possible and has always taken a
platform agnostic approach to its internet services. It is not possible
to put an exact timeframe on when BBC iPlayer will be available for Mac

German chapter of the Wikimedia Foundation is hiring a Wikipedian to
coordinate the efforts. 'The challenge will be to motivate experts who
have done good work in other projects to get involved in the community
lexicon. As project director Florian Gerlach told heise online, "Such
expert reports are usually written, edited, and published in the normal
newspapers or even on other websites. But Wikipedia is radically
different: articles there continually grow with input from numerous
authors, who often remain anonymous. The end product is constantly
changing, and third parties can publish their own texts or even change
yours." The future authors will therefore receive some training to help
them work with Wikipedia.'"

In the world of Massively Multiplayer Online Games, guilds live and die
like generations of fruit flies. In the time it takes you to read this
review, another group of friends will probably have decided to go their
separate ways. Due to what is commonly referred to as 'drama', and the
nature of the currently most popular online game, the modern MMOG guild
tends to be a short-lived affair. A book published about a single guild,
then, has to be discussing a singular organization. And indeed, The
Syndicate has lasted for over a decade. Well known in both Ultima Online
and EverQuest, and going strong into the days of World of Warcraft,
they've had numerous public successes and some notorious failures. Their
tale is a strange, and utterly personal view of the history of Massive
games. It's also highly self-aggrandizing and probably contentious, but
that's to be expected. [0]Legend of the Syndicate is a publication worth
reading by anyone interested in the history of the Massive genre, or the
future of social networks online.

[0]ElvaWSJ writes "Wi-Fi was supposed to reduce complications, not create
new ones. But [1]in many offices Wi-Fi has been a headache. Like all
radio signals, Wi-Fi is subject to interference. Its low power — less
than even a typical cellphone — means that walls and cabinets can
significantly reduce signal strength. Wi-Fi also creates networks that
are more open than wired ones, raising security issues. And Wi-Fi has
caused problems for virtual private networks. Some VPNs require a lot of
processing power. If a wireless access point — at home, at the office, or
on the road — isn't robust enough, a user often gets bumped off the
connection."

A number of readers sent in stories about [0]Net radio going dark for a
day. Not all of it, but according to the Globe and Mail at least 45
stations representing thousands of channels. The stations are protesting
a ruling establishing royalty rates that will put most of them out of
business on July 15. "The ruling... is expected to cost large webcasters
such as Yahoo and Real Networks millions of dollars, drive smaller
websites like Pandora.com and Live365.com out of business and leave a
large chunk of the 72 million Net radio listeners in the dark."
SaveNetRadio has a page where US residents can [1]locate their senators
and representatives to call them today.

[0]BigBadBus writes in with a claim by an Italian team that they may have
found an [1]impact crater resulting from the 1908 Tunguska explosion over
Siberia. The BBC story quotes a number of impact experts who doubt the
Italians' claim. "A University of Bologna team says a lake near the
epicenter of the blast may be occupying a crater hollowed out by a chunk
of rock that hit the ground. Lake Cheko — though shallow — fits the
proportions of a small, bowl-shaped impact crater, say the Italy-based
scientists. Their investigation of the lake bottom's geology reveals a
funnel-like shape not seen in neighboring lakes. In addition, a
geophysics survey of the lake bed has turned up an unusual feature about
10m down which could either be compacted lake sediments or a buried
fragment of space rock."

[0]athloi sends word of an expansion of the US-VISIT program that now
requires two fingerprints from foreign visitors arriving at scores of
airports. Beginning later this year the US will be testing a system that
[1]collects 10 digital fingerprints, at 10 major points of entry. A US
Homeland Security director assured EU officials that the program would
operate under strict privacy rules. But he noted that the FBI and CIA
will have access to the biometric data, which over time may expand beyond
fingerprints.

An anonymous reader writes "Finally, some good news on electronic voting.
The New York state legislature [0] rejected an amendment proposed by
Microsoft's lobbyists which would have [1]gutted New York's requirements
for voting machine vendors to turn over their source code to the state
Board of Elections. Assemblywoman Barbara Lifton commented: 'The voting
machine vendors have known for two years what our laws said. Now they're
saying that those parts of their systems using Microsoft software have to
be proprietary? It's just wrong.'"
