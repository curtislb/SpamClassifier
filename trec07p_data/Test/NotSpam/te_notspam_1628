Beyond the blockbuster
Drugs firms are rethinking their business model


LIPITOR is a drugs company's dream. The cholesterol pill made by Pfizer, an
American pharmaceuticals giant, is the world's best-selling drug. Last year
it earned over $13 billion in revenues. Other hugely successful drugs
include GlaxoSmithKline's Advair, an asthma remedy, and Plavix, a blood
thinner, which is sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Sanofi-Aventis. Both
enjoy billions of dollars in annual sales. Despite such rewards, however,
pharmaceutical companies are reconsidering their pursuit of blockbuster
drugs, as new technology permits the creation of niche remedies that target
rare ailments or sub-populations of people suffering from common diseases.

That explains the $3 billion hostile takeover bid announced this week by
Roche, a Swiss pharmaceutical firm, for Ventana Medical Systems, an
American diagnostics firm. This year, Roche has gobbled up several
diagnostics and genetic-testing firms making technologies that enhance the
value of its targeted cancer therapies. The firm recently completed a $155m
takeover of 454 Life Sciences, which makes gene-sequencing technology and
last week spent some $273m on NimbleGen, which makes technologies used in
identifying the genetic causes of disease.

Roche is being drawn away from conventional one-size-fits-all drugs partly
by the allure of the lucrative new markets being created by the development
of “personalised medicine”. But drugs giants are also victims of their own
success. Blockbusters like Lipitor are already so effective, argues Tom
Nagle of Monitor, a management consultancy, that it is difficult to come up
with alternatives that are good enough to command a higher price.

Worse, many blockbusters are going off patent soon and pharmaceutical
giants are finding it increasingly difficult to come up with new drugs to
replace them—despite throwing pots of money at the problem (see chart).
Makers of generic drugs are also growing more assertive in attacking
patents. As a result of all this, reckons IMS, an industry consultancy, the
industry saw a record $18 billion in branded sales collapse in 2006.

There are signs that long-term investors are growing concerned. A coalition
of institutional investors representing over $1.1 trillion in assets,
issued a report this month demanding a “rethink of core business
assumptions”. Martin Eijgenhuijsen of ABP, a Dutch pension fund that is
part of the coalition, says, “We have serious doubts that the current
business model can deliver targeted drugs. This requires radical change.”

So is the industry ready to follow Roche's lead toward specialty products,
targeted therapies and the like? The answer seems to be yes. Ray Hill of
IMS calculates that although the vast mainstream market for chronic
diseases like high blood pressure or diabetes is still important, specialty
drugs accounted for nearly two thirds of total revenue growth last year, up
from just a third in 2000. And only a quarter of drugs launched last year
tackled chronic diseases, suggesting the pipeline is shifting toward
targeted therapies.

For that trend, thank both technology and regulation. Anthony Farino of the
consultancy arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers argues that such technologies as
high-throughput sequencing, genomics and personal phenotyping, which were
not available five years ago, are now transforming how drugs are discovered
and tested. Ron Krall, GSK's chief medical officer, thinks the trick is
identifying which patients will benefit most from new treatments—or,
equally usefully, which ones will have adverse reactions. To determine
that, his firm has just opened a new facility in London run jointly with
Imperial College and Hammersmith Hospital, where experimental drugs are
tested. The “micro-doses” they administer to patients are analysed in real
time by molecular scanners.

Regulators could play a decisive role in the large drugs companies'
shifting strategies. The risk-averse stance they have taken since safety
problems led Merck to recall its painkiller, Vioxx, may help propel the
industry more rapidly away from blockbusters. Viren Mehta, an industry
expert, speculates that although new drugs will always carry unknown risks,
the regulatory burden might prove lighter for those aimed at specific,
acute conditions (as opposed to ongoing maladies like diabetes). After all,
he says, “Fewer people are at risk for a shorter time.”

Another regulatory boost may come from cost-benefit analysis that considers
the long-term benefits, and not just the high price tags, of innovative new
drugs. Britain's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence
(NICE) has approved Herceptin, a targeted cancer drug, despite an annual
cost per patient of nearly $50,000 because, in the words of Sir Michael
Rawlins, NICE's chairman, “it provides long-term value”. NICE has also
agreed to buy a cancer treatment made by Johnson & Johnson that has little
effect on a third of patients, on the condition that it pay only when the
drug works. And with an expensive Alzheimer's drug, the agency ruled that
it would not pay for patients with the mildest form of dementia to take
it—a ruling that was challenged in a London court this week.

Such lawsuits are a sign that the transition to a new way of doing business
carries risks. But as Graham Higson, head of regulatory affairs at
AstraZeneca, a British drugs firm, notes: “There's no such thing as no
risk. The industry simply cannot continue developing drugs exactly the same
way it has for 40 years.”
