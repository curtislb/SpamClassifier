It's unlikely (Bob has to be in a jurisdiction within the US where offering
such legal advice is a criminal offense, and someone has to file charges,
and the police have to decide it's worth their bother to get a warrant for
your arrest, and the warrant has to come to the attention of someone you
come in contact with when you enter the US), but seems possible.

Do you also count on First Amendment protection against charges of libel,
slander, and false advertising?
