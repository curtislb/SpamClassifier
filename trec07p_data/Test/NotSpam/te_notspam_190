TONIGHT ON SHOWBIZ TONIGHT- CNN HEADLINE PRIME 11pm ET/ 11pm PT

<b>PARIS HILTON -- OUT OF JAIL!</b>
Paris Hilton is out of jail; but what happens now? She isn't out of the woods yet -- she is still on probation, and everyone is waiting to see if she really is a changed woman! Was Paris treated unfairly in jail? And given the cost and the media circus, Showbiz Tonight is asking: Was this all worth it? The answers to all these questions and more, tonight on TV's most provocative entertainment news show.

<b>PARIS HILTON -- THE FIRST INTERVIEW!</b>
On Wednesday, Paris will do her first post-jail interview on CNN's "Larry King Live." What are the tough questions she needs to be ready to answer? Going forward, what image does she need to portray to repair her image? Showbiz Tonight rounds up the experts for advice for Paris.

<b>PARIS HILTON -- THE TEACHER!?</b>
Paris has received a million-dollar offer -- to be a teacher! What could she possibly be qualified to teach, and should she take the gig? The inside story tonight on Showbiz Tonight.

<b>SHOWBIZ TONIGHT QUESTION OF THE DAY:</b>
Paris Hilton out of jail: Do you think she learned her lesson?
