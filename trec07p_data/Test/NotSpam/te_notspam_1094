That helps a lot. Thanks. I asked the upstream and they seem not to be
against using the old BSD license with the ad clause, so that maybe
the next version will be distributed with that license.

I realized, that 2.3.2 version that I am going to package at the
moment contains the license below, which is not free, but can go to
non-free. The problem above is only for the 2.3.3 version.
