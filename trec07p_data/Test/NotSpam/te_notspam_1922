Hi Amichai

The error about $tmp was a compile error. Because the program didn't compile 
it didn't run.

Now you've managed to get it to compile, perl has run your program.

These errors are run-time errors. In other words, they show errors in your 
logic rather than your syntax.

As a further clue, look at how you are indexing the array - specifically on 
line 11.  If necessary, walk through the program with pen and paper.

The mistake you've made is a common one

Gary
