What are you trying to run it on? Chat works on sugar jhbuild, and
requires a relatively up to date sugar and presenceservice (certainly
newer than build 406 if you are running on an XO or emulation).

Chat uses a text channel, so you can send text back and forth. For more
sophisticated collaboration, we have D-Bus tubes, which allow signals
and method calls.

See projects/hellomesh in git for an example of tubes.

Ask if you need help :)
