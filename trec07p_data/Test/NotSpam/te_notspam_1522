This is the correct option; the logo either should be removed,
replaced with the open use debian logo, replaced with a freely
licensed image of your choice, or replaced with an empty image. [The
main problem with the Gentoo logo is that it doesn't have a licence
statement which allows users to modify the logo.]

The decision as to which solution to use is of course the
maintainer's.
