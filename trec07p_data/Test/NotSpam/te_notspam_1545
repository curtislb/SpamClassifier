Volker,

I still don't see the problem. Use DLIST_REMOVE() and it will do the
right thing. You can remove in any order you like.

Do you have a snippet of code showing the problem you are thinking of?

If there is a loop at one level then the stack idea won't really help
with the peak memory usage (which is really what matters). 

If what you really want this for is DEBUG() then maybe a varient of
DEBUG() that allocates a _tmp_ctx would make sense? Eg:

 #define DEBUG_TMP_CTX(level, xx) do { \
	TALLOC_CTX *_tmp_ctx = talloc_new(NULL); \
	DEBUG(level, xx); \
	talloc_free(_tmp_ctx); \
 } while(0)

then use _tmp_ctx in the debug args.

would that help with the current static string uses?

Cheers, Tridge
