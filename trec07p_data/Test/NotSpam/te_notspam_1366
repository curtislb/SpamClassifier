mrspin writes "Media streaming boxes such as the AppleTV, XBox 360, PS3,
and products from Netgear do a varying job of bridging the gap between
the PC and television as well as, in some cases, delivering Internet
content directly into the living room. But all are closed systems. The
result of which is that users are left trying to hack these devices
[0]against the wishes of manufacturers or have to make-do with whatever
official features are implemented. Bucking this trend, [1]Neuros is
taking a wholly different approach, and has open-sourced the firmware for
its Neuros OSD media center, meaning that anybody is free to write
add-ons that extend the device's functionality. This week the company
announced that thanks to the open-source community, the device now lets
users browse, search and view the entire YouTube catalog."

Simulex is the company developing these systems, and they list
pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and defense contractor Lockheed Martin

customer, apparently now running the most complex version of the system.
[1]JFCOM-9 is now capable of running real-time simulations for up to 62

[0]mytrip writes with a Reuters article about a new, [1]unusual insurance
requirement for drivers in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Apparently Winnipeg is one
of the worst cities in Canada for auto thefts. New and 'high-risk' cars
will now be required to install an electronic immobilizers in order to
qualify for car insurance. "Chomiak said cars are stolen twice as often
in Winnipeg as in other Manitoba cities, while a 2005 report from
Statistics Canada said the city had a higher per-capita car theft rate
than larger cities like Vancouver, Montreal and Toronto. The province,
where cars are insured through Manitoba Public Insurance, will fork over
C$15 million ($14 million) so that owners without immobilizers can have
them installed."

Dr. [Craig] Venter concedes that this may be a long way away, but he says
he has taken an important key step towards that goal. His team,

G4Cube passed us a link to a New York Times article about a troubling
development in public photography rights. New York City is considering
[0]requiring a permit for photographers, film-makers, and even possibly
tourists who want to shoot imagery in the Big Apple. "New rules being
considered by the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting would
require any group of two or more people who want to use a camera in a
single public location for more than a half hour to get a city permit and
insurance. The same requirements would apply to any group of five or more
people who plan to use a tripod in a public location for more than 10
minutes, including the time it takes to set up the equipment. Julianne
Cho, assistant commissioner of the film office, said the rules were not
intended to apply to families on vacation or amateur filmmakers or
photographers. Nevertheless, the New York Civil Liberties Union says the
proposed rules, as strictly interpreted, could have that effect. The
group also warns that the rules set the stage for selective and perhaps
discriminatory enforcement by police."

the 50th test case you sent that crashes the service. You restart the Web
daemon and retransmit your last malicious payload, but nothing happens...
The issue must rely on some combination of inputs. Perhaps an earlier
packet put the Web server in a state that later allowed the 50th test to
trigger the memory corruption. We can't tell without further analysis and
we can't narrow the possibilities down without the capability of
replaying the entire test set in a methodical fashion.'"

kripkenstein sends us an article by [0]Freeman Dyson in the NY Review of
Books, in which the eminent physicist and big thinker takes on the
[1]possible end to the Darwinian era of speciation that has endured 3
billion years on this planet. He discusses the history and future of
biology in terms that many in this community will find familiar: "[We can
speculate about] a golden age... when horizontal gene transfer was
universal and separate species did not yet exist. Life was then a
community of cells of various kinds, sharing their genetic information...
Evolution could be rapid... But then, one evil day, a cell resembling a
primitive bacterium happened to find itself one jump ahead of its
neighbors in efficiency. That cell, anticipating Bill Gates by three
billion years, separated itself from the community and refused to
share... [But] now, as Homo sapiens domesticates the new biotechnology,
we are reviving the ancient... practice of horizontal gene transfer,
moving genes easily from microbes to plants and animals, blurring the
boundaries between species. We are moving rapidly into the post-Darwinian
era, when... the rules of Open Source sharing will be extended from the
exchange of software to the exchange of genes. Then the evolution of life
will once again be communal, as it was in the good old days before
separate species and intellectual property were invented."

Mitechsi writes "Dell has struck a deal with Emerson to sell [0]advanced
liquid cooling systems and services to data center owners. One type of
supplemental cooling technology is called the [1]Liebert XD. The XD
consists of refrigerant-filled pipes that snake around the server racks
in a data center. The liquid system cuts the cooling power load by about
30%–50% compared to other types of cooling systems."

| Exxon's Brute Squad Hacks the Yes Men                              |

tom_evil notes a story up on Infoshop.org about a parody site and the
lack of a sense of humor in a large multinational. "One day after the Yes
Men made a [0]joke announcement of ExxonMobil's plans to turn billions of
climate-change victims into a brand-new fuel called Vivoleum, the Yes
Men's upstream internet service provider [1]shut down Vivoleum.com and
cut off the Yes Men's email service, in reaction to a complaint whose
source they will not identify. 'Since parody is protected under US law,
Exxon must think that people seeing the site will think Vivoleum's a real
Exxon product, not just a parody,' said Yes Man Mike Bonanno. Exxon's
policies do already contribute to [2]150,000 climate-change related
deaths each year,' added Yes Man Andy Bichlbaum. 'So maybe it really is
credible. What a resource!'"

[0]MBCook tips an article at Gizmodo that begins with a reader's
experiences trying to buy an iPhone [1]yesterday at an AT&T store and an
Apple store. Many, but not all, of the comments on the post echo this
reader's experience: Apple good, AT&T bad. "Day one revealed what all
Apple aficionados fear. That AT&T, through the depths of its
incompetence, could derail the iPhone."
