						<B>Today's Quote for the Day:</B>
<br>
"I love you Hugh Grant. He put my two kids through school and gave us the c=
hance of a better life. Thanks to him we bought a new house, Rolex watches,=
 a Rolls-Royce, a Mercedes and diamonds" - Divine Brown, the Hollywood call=
-girl whose brief encounter with the British actor brought her fame and for=
tune.
<br>

<br>
<B>In tonight's programme:</b>
<br>
=20
<br>
<B>Terror Cells</b>
<br>
We'll have the latest on the terrorist attacks in Glasgow and London. We're=
 working on a number of stories on the terror plots and how some of the sus=
pects may have been radicalised. Can't say any more for now. But do watch t=
he programme.=20
<br>

<br>
<B>Constitution</b>
<br>
Today some sweeping proposals on constitutional change from Zombie Brown. I=
s this to make government fit for the 21st century or to address the West L=
othian question a particular problem for a Scottish Prime Minister? We'll b=
e asking Jack Straw what it is all about?
<br>

<br>
<B>Pardon Me President Bush</b>
<br>
Yesterday Scooter Libby had a let off. President Bush ensured that he did n=
ot go to jail. Remember Scooter was the Vice President's chief of staff con=
victed after the wife of Ambassador Wilson was outed as a CIA agent. Tonigh=
t we hear from that Ambassador - Joe Wilson - about why he is not happy wit=
h the President's actions.
<br>

<br>
<B>Environment Agency</b>
<br>
And The "Polluter Pays"... it's a guiding principle of today's environment =
laws. But has the Environment Agency - still reeling from criticism over it=
s handling of the floods - also blown its chance to force one of the world'=
s largest chemicals companies to pay for pollution dumped here in the UK - =
leaving the British tax payer to foot a multi million pound bill? Susan Wat=
ts has an exclusive report.=20
<br>

<br>
<b>And finally:</b>=20=20
<br>
Today's Joke Fit For An Eleven Year Old comes from Newsnight viewer Mike Co=
hen.=20
<br>

<br>
In Jerusalem, a Reuters journalist heard about a very old Jewish man who ha=
d been going to the Wailing Wall to pray, twice a day, everyday, for a long=
, long time. So she went to check it out. She went to the Wailing Wall and =
there he was! She watched him pray and after about 45 minutes, when he turn=
ed to leave, she approached him for an interview.
<br>
"I'm Rebecca Smith from Reuters. Sir, how long have you been coming to the =
Wall and praying?"
<br>
"For about 60 years."
<br>
"60 years! That's amazing! What do you pray for?"
<br>
"I pray for peace between the Christians, Jews and the Muslims. I pray for =
all the hatred to stop and I pray for all our children to grow up in safety=
 and friendship."
<br>
"How do you feel after doing this for 60 years?"
<br>
"Like I'm talking to a ****** wall."
<br>

<br>
Newsnight is at 10.30pm on BBC2.=20
