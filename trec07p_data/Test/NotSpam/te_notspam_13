"Mercury SGD is our dedicated communication device, approved by 
Medicare and other insurance programs as a speech-generating device."

http://www.assistivetech.com/p-mercury.htm

Approved by medicare for over $7000. This is what I mean.
If you look at the big picture, there is more going on than what 
you observe in prices and such. Such prices would not be even
thinkable without the fact that it's "covered" which means some
people will have them, most will not, and if the market really 
was free then the prices would be dramatically lower.
