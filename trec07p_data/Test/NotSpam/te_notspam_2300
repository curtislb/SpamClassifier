						<B>ALAN JOHNSTON IS FREE!</B>
<br>
After 114 days, the wait is over. We all woke up this morning to the fantas=
tic news that our colleague Alan Johnston was released from captivity in th=
e early hours of this morning. Alan himself has been extraordinary - compos=
ed, dignified and characteristically self-effacing - as he's talked today a=
bout both his ordeal and his first few hours of freedom. Tonight, we will b=
ring you his story - in his words.=20=20
<br>

<br>
We will also look at what happened behind the scenes to secure his release.=
 Hamas has clearly playing a significant role in achieving this and have sa=
id that they would like "recognition" for what they've done. So what might =
this mean for future diplomatic relations with them?=20
<br>

<br>
<B>POLITICS OF TERROR</B>
<br>
Last night on Newsnight we heard how a former member of Hizb ut Tahrir had =
been in close contact with one of those suspected of carrying out the attac=
k on Glasgow Airport. Now today in his first Prime Minister's Questions Gor=
don Brown was asked why the controversial organisation Hizb ut Tahrir hasn'=
t been banned. Zombie Brown said he would look at the evidence. Meanwhile J=
ohn Reid, the former Home Secretary apparently decided Zombie Brown needed =
a little help and intervened to urge the Prime Minister to stick with his d=
ecision that, based on the evidence, the group shouldn't be banned.=20
<br>
Newsnight's Richard Watson has been monitoring Hizb ut Tahrir's activities =
over several years and will be assessing the arguments for and against.=20
<br>

<br>
<B>PMQs</B>
<br>
The moment both sides had been waiting for as Zombie Brown and David Camero=
n met at the Despatch Box for their first Prime Minister's Questions. So ho=
w did it go? Michael Crick will give his verdict.
<br>

<br>
<B>CHOCOLATE</b>
<br>
You may remember that earlier this year, Humphrey Hawksley travelled to Ivo=
ry Coast where he met 12 year old Mark Yao Kwame - just one of twelve thous=
and children who have been sold as slaves to farm cocoa on plantations in W=
est Africa. His film on Mark's plight inspired a London primary school to w=
rite a play about Mark's story. Humphrey went to the school, met the childr=
en and watched the rehearsals. But the children wanted answers so tonight s=
ome of the cast will confront a representative from the chocolate industry =
in the Newsnight studio .=20
