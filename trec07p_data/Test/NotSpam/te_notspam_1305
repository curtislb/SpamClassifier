Doing so would add considerable complexity, at least as far as I know.

Sometimes I run within an MPI session and sometimes not.  My
understanding is that SPRNG will not work if MPI is absent.  I think
someone on the SPRNG list told me that there wasn't a good way to handle
this at run-time.  Unfortunately, a lot of SPRNG options seem to be
compile-time settings.

Using SPRNG would also complicate my build process, as I'd need autoconf
magic to support it.

Part of the issue is that I want something I can redistribute, not just
something that will work for me on a  one-off basis.

One simple solution would be to build several versions of the library.
A not so simple solution would be to build various random number
generators as separate libraries, and dynamically load the appropriate
one.
