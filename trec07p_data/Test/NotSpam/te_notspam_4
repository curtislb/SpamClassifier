I really don't have a problem paying for software I use be
it to make otherwise usable software accessible or simply
to get a job done.  As far as I'm concerned, the makers of
access tech can charge any amount they'd like.  If it's too
expensive, people will either not use it or more likely
develope their own solutions which doesn't hurt opensource
in the slightest.

Not trying to justify closed source software at all as the
key advantage of open source for me anyway isn't its free
of charge nature but rather for the ability to modify it to
suit my needs.

For those who think prices are inflated by the greedy
corporation, if that were the case and so much profit was
being made in the area, why haven't other firms entered the
market, driving prices down as a result?
