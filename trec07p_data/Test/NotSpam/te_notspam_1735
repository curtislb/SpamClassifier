Hello Lovelies,

Turner Classic Movies cable channel is going to be showing the  
original full-length British version of Curse of the Demon, aka Night  
of the Demon.  Film buffs may already know that Tourneur's vision for  
the film was somewhat mangled by producer Hal Chester, and that the  
US version was trimmed enough to mar the continuity.  Here's more on  
the film's history, with show times, quotes, and a quick mention of  
Kate from the TCM website:

Enjoy!

-Karen
