Fair enough.

I am not fond of the fact that we can retrieve the SID from the client
side at all, but I need to elaborate more to explain that so let just
put this discussion aside for now.

Well that may be true, or perhaps just translating immediately at the
entry/exit point would have been ok as well. I think the real problem
was that we let the untranslated name leak everywhere.

It depends on the context in which you use pam authentication.
If you use it only for system/ssh login it is probably ok, while on a
busy POP/SMTP email server (or apache with pam_auth) with a few
thousands of users the pam_winbind performances may be much more
critical.

That said, the reduction in the number of lines of code, may still be a
good enough reason to prefer your patch over other approaches.

Simo.
