Explain, please.  There have been a number of copyright complaints
filed (in Germany and the US) over GPLed software.  The GPL's copyleft
nature did not bar those lawsuits.  I am not aware of any that went to
trial in the US, but at least one German lawsuit alleging GPL
violations was decided[1] for the licensor, and other cases (in both
countries) have settled with the defendant agreeing to comply with the
GPL.

That unattributed "has been cited" reads like a poor appeal to an
indefinite authority.  Daniel Wallace's failed anti-trust lawsuit
_cited_ such provisions as reasons to consider the GPLv2 invalid,
unenforceable and an unlawful conspiracy with respect to anti-trust
law.  We can see how far making that claim got him.

(Incidentally, neither the district court's ruling[2] to dismiss
Wallace's complaint, nor the appeals court's order[3] upholding
dismissal, treat the requirement to provide source code as a fee.  To
the contrary, their orders seem to view it primarily as a benefit to
the end user and to the software community.

)

While there is a fairly broad range of what people on this list think
is a "fee", in the end, providing source code for software that one
distributes has never been considered a fee.  Giving up tangible
property, actions unrelated to software (such as petting a cat) and
intellectual property unrelated to the software in question (such as
over-broad patent defense clauses) have been considered fees.
Concessions necessary to exercise software freedoms have not.
