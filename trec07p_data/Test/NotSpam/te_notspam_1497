Well...  From your message I didn't see that you were clear on the
distinctions between the hash types and I thought you might want/need to
read that material.  I'm glad the ms link was useful.

I'd like to get a clearer explanation here.  The NTLM hash is never created
using DES.  It is always done using MD4.  Above, you have the NTLM has being
derived from the LM hash.  Do you mean the NTLM response?  What you have
there doesn't describe any scheme I know.

The password hash is *never* sent.  The information sent to the server is
the encryption of the challenge (called the "response").  On older systems,
the first field is typically the LM response (the challenge encrypted using
the LM hash) and the second field is typically the NTLM response (the
challenge encrypted using the NTLM hash).

In some cases (if the client has been configured to not send the LM
response) the first and second field will both contain the NTLM response.

If more advanced authorization is required, then the client will send the
LMv2 response in the first field and the (very large) NTLMv2 response in the
second field.

Beyond that we get into "Extended Security" which is probably beyond what
you are trying to work on.

Hope it helps.
