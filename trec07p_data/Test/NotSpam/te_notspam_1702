Ted T'so presented a very similar streams implementation at  
linux.conf.au in 2006:

A variation on this would be to store the streams metadata in a Samba- 
private EA. This would give you something analogous to the streaminfo  
data link back to the hidden streams data files. You would be able to  
quickly determine the stream status for a file and you'd have a lot of  
flexibility in evolving the implementation. You'd also be able to  
reconstruct the EA metadata from the hidden streams data (slowly), and  
verify the hidden streams data from the EA (quickly). If you  
standardised the EA format, you would be able to add non-Samba tools  
to manipulate streams.
