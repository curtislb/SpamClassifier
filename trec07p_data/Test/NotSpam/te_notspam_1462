I don't know if any1 else has thought of this, but I think it would be a 
wonderful improvement if mark, cut, and paste were by specific consoles, or 
with an option to paste in another TTY.  Right now, really only way to save a 
console section, would be inserting in an editor.  Looks like insert 7 is free, 
maybe have insert 7 as global-and-keep insert 8 as individual.
Thanks in advance for considering these suggestions
Hart
