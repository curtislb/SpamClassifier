Does anyone know what they're doing about zipslack, since umsdos isn't
supported in 2.6.x? Are they dropping that too? I haven't used
zipslack/zipspeak for a very, very long time, but I was just
wondering. From a sentimental point of view, it would be sad to see
zipslack dropped, that's what I started out with.
