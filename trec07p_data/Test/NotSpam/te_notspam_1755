The waiver is incomplete. Only the application of Article 22.4 (Scope
of Application of Dispute Settlement Proceedings) is delayed for the
first 18 months.

I mean that an individual drug company holding a patent right on
pharmaceutical product can raise a suit against a generic company to
block the marketing approval by relying on FTA text (Article
18.9:5(b)). The drug company may also take an action against Korean
drug approving authority. Further, the drug company can rely on ISD
(Investor-State Dispute) provision in Chapter 11 (Investment). These
actions are possible because the waiver regarding the implementation
obligation of "linkage" is only applied to the dispute under Chapter
22.
