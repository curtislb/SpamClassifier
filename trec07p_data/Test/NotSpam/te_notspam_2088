It's probably to do with the "v2 or later" stuff. I can't remember, but 
it was discussed on Groklaw, and v3 *is* retroactive to the extent that 
a lot of stuff is licenced "or later".

Certainly the feeling is that MS will get caught by this date thingy as 
a result of their deal with Novell.

In that case, they simply wouldn't be able to distribute GPL software, 
because they wouldn't be able to comply with the licence.
