Clearly.

Rather, it has gained another, less literal, use, which may not be what
Francesco intended to communicate.

I would interpret it as a fear.  Unless there's some survey data or
something to the contrary, I suspect most other rural Englishmen would.
I'm a bit old-fashioned like that, which is why newspeak like "You're
forcing me to ..." looks silly to me.

More generally, please cut non-native speakers some Slack about English
use when it matters like this.  If a German walks into your restaurant
and says "Please can I become a steak?" then that is not justification
for killing and butchering him.  You know damn well what was meant.

(The only non-native speakers who I won't cut slack are those who start
preaching their interpretation of English as The One True Meaning over
objections from Englishmen. ;-) )
