When Creative Commons published their Podcasting Legal Guide last year,
I was approached by Mark Blevis, the Canadian podcaster and host of the
Electric Sky Podcast and the Canadian Podcast Buffet. Mark said the
Guide was good, but podcasters knew it was written for the U.S. market
and felt it had limited use in Canada. Mark asked if CC Canada could
create a Canadian version of the Guide that Canadian podcasters could
rely on.

Kathleen Simmons and I have worked over the last few months to do just
that and we were very happy to launch the Podcasting Legal Guide for
Canada this past weekend at the Podcasters Across Borders conference in
Kingston, Ontario. There were printed copies for everybody at the
conference, but you can get your own copy in pdf format on our website:

Cheers,
