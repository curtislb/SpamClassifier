So, IIUC, you feel that this interpretation is too far fetched, and the
only interpretation that could hold up in court is the intended one:
forbidding use of DMCA/EUCD/... to take away freedoms granted by the
license.
And this clause, interpreted as intended, is a DFSG-free restriction.

Mmmh, maybe you are right.  Maybe my concerns about this clause are bit
exaggerated...

I am not sure, but anyway, who can really be sure about anything?!?

The scenario I am mainly worried about is the following.

The work A is published under the terms of the GNU GPL v3.
A has *no* interactive interfaces, because it's not an interactive work.
I receive work A and want to create a modified work based on A.
The modified work is named B and has one, newly implemented, interactive
interface.  Hence, work B is an interactive work.
I want to distribute work B in source form.

In this scenario, I have to comply with Section 5 of the GNU GPL v3.
Work B is the "work based on the Program" referred to in the first
sentence of Section 5:

|   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
| produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
| terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
| conditions:

On the other hand, work A is the "Program".
Is that right?  I cannot see any other reasonable interpretation.

Hence, I read clause 5d as:

|  d) If the work [=3D work B] has interactive user interfaces [yes, it
|  has one], each must display Appropriate Legal Notices [I must
|  implement the feature in the newly created interactive interface];
|  however, if the Program [=3D work A] has interactive interfaces [no,
|  it has none] that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work
|  need not make them do so [this does not apply, since the condition is
|  false].

This means that I'm compelled to implement the feature in the newly
created interactive interface, even if I don't want to.

Hooray!  Another check-on-case-by-case-basis license!  :-(

Yes, I should have written "greatly weakens", I was dramatizing a bit
too much...

I don't count on it to happen...  :-(
The FSF seems to not listen to Free Software supporters anymore.  Or, at
least, it seems to listen to the wrong ones...
