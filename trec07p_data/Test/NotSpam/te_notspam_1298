Yesterday I managed to get myself an account on droplinegnome.org I left a 
bug message since droplinegnome hasn't yet got festival where one can 
install it and use it to get orca talking. Today I managed to build the 
astrolog 5.40 package for slackware and did it correctly enough that the 
package shows up in my packages list when I install it and so far as I can 
tell the whole package works too. I just learned how to make a slackware 
package that would do that.  Unfortunately linuxpackages.net uses capsha's 
so even though I built a package I can't register and submit it. Not good 
news for anyone else in the speakup community wanting to submit a package. 
What I'm curious to know though is what the situation is with debian 
fedoraproject, gentoo, and ubuntu.  Do these sites also block totally 
blind package submitters from registering?  It was a surprise to me 
droplinegnome didn't place such an impediment in my way but I'm not going 
to hold that against them.
