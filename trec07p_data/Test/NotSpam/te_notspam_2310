Dual-licence it ...

Think TrollTech and Qt - which is freely available under the GPL, but 
you can also licence it direct from TT and then do "proprietary" things 
with it.

I haven't bothered to read the licence, but you could say "my code is 
dual-licenced under the GPL, and under the Jagged Alliance licence". 
Then the Jagged Alliance people can do what they want to under the 
Jagged Alliance licence, and anybody who cares to can separate your code 
out (or download it from you if you keep it separate) and use it under 
the GPL.

The only snag is, if the Jagged Alliance and GPL licences are 
incompatible, the package as a whole would only be distributable under 
the Jagged Alliance licence, and probably wouldn't qualify for 
distribution with Debian.

Cheers,
Wol
