I am very much a novice R user, and this is my first post to the List,
but given that disclaimer, perhaps you could put library(Rcmdr) as a
line in your Rprofile.site file?  I think this contains commands that
are run every time R is opened.  [At least, I noticed after I installed
my Tinn-R and got it to communicate with R, that certain R packages
necessary for use of Tinn-R now get run every time I open Tinn-R (and R
opens with it.)]

That way, typing R on the command line (might!) run Rcmdr too.
