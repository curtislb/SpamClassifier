First stop and explain what it is you want to achieve without
preconceived notions of how to do it.  You, as a human*, may use the
Device Manager program to do things, but that does not mean it is the
best way for a program to do those same things.  It may turn out to be
comparable to asking "Is there a module that can control Explorer"
when all you want to do is delete a file (the unlink function by the
way).

* this is an assumption, but I think it is valid one since I don't
think an AI would use MS Windows.
