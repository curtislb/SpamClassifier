The tone of this newspaper article is very offensive to me because =

Restive jail inmates clog toilets; county gets $700,000 repair bill
By Michael Manekin
MediaNews
Article Launched: 06/28/2007 01:34:48 AM PDT

Orange jumpsuits at the San Mateo County jail are more than just =
standard issue clothing for some inmates - they're a means for =
overflowing the toilets at the Maguire Correctional Facility, wreaking =
havoc.=20

To county officials, that's about $700,000 down the drain, according to =
a bill from the South Bayside Systems Authority, the joint powers =
authority that administers Redwood City's sewer system.=20

"This is a big-dollar problem," said Sheriff Greg Munks. "It's a =
continuing problem, and the bill is only going to get bigger."=20

The problem has grown so expensive that the county manager, the county =
counsel and the board of supervisors have joined the sheriff's =
department in trying to resolve the issue with the South Bayside Systems =
Authority.=20

Calls to the South Bayside Systems Authority were not returned.=20

County law enforcement officials say nearly every correctional facility =
in the country regularly experiences such flushing fiascoes. Often, the =
problem is exacerbated because inmates, who operate the laundry =
facilities at many jails, will distribute extra clothing and sheets to =
their friends.=20

Such abuses are hard to monitor in the overcrowded condition at the =
county's jail, Munks said.=20

"When you have a facility designed for 688 and our count is about 1,050, =
it's very difficult," he said. "When you have two deputies guarding 96 =
inmates, their foremost concern has to be the safety of staff and the =
safety of the inmates - and searching for extra blankets, extra =
jumpsuits, extra clothing items . . . we do it, but we're sometimes =
hindered."=20

The sheriff's department has stepped up its action plan to stop the =
activity. Several months ago, officials installed grinders in the =
Maguire facility designed to chew up chunky items in the jail's pipes.=20

Now that it's obvious that the grinders have not resolved the problem - =
the county counsel reportedly received Monday a $30,000 invoice from the =
authority - the sheriff's department is considering tried-and-true =
alternatives imported from other jails.=20

Among the fresh approaches: Installing delayed-flush mechanisms and =
screens on jail cell toilets; stocking the jail commissary with items =
wrapped in more biodegradable packaging; and rethinking the =
standard-issue possessions given to inmates.=20

Punishment is yet another option, according to Munks.=20

"We are considering charging inmates criminally or disciplining them by =
taking money off their commissary books," he said.=20

"There has to be consequences for these actions," county Supervisor =
Jerry Hill said. "The sheriff needs to develop a mechanism for =
discipline or punishment of those inmates intentionally destroying =
property."=20
