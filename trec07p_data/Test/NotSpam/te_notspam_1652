						<b>Quote for the Day:</b>=20
<br>
I've just returned from the United States where I have been researching a d=
ocumentary series for Radio Four called "The Clinton Years" to be broadcast=
 in August and September. Today's Quote for the Day comes from a former Cli=
nton Cabinet member who started assessing George Bush's presidency. "But Ge=
orge Bush has changed," I suggested to him. "For example, now he seems to g=
et Global Warming." The former Clinton Cabinet member started to laugh. "Pr=
esident Bush does NOT get Global Warming," he insisted. "In fact he doesn't=
 even get Evolution."=20

<b>In tonight's programme:</b>
<br>
Foreign jihadists, not home grown terrorists? What difference does it make?=
 We'll have the latest on the fast moving investigation into the terror att=
acks in London and Glasgow, and we'll also be assessing the motives behind =
the attacks. Is there really a link to British foreign policy? Or -- given =
that a nightclub was the target of one of the London attacks, and a previou=
s bomb plot targeted The Ministry of Sound -- are these attacks primarily d=
irected against the western way of life?  We hope to be speaking to leading=
 politicians and a former jihadist about what can be done.=20=20=20

<br>

<b>Trouble for the Tories?</b>
<br>
Are the Conservatives stuck in a rut? As the Zombie Brown / New Labour re-l=
aunch gives way to the current terrorist attacks, can the Tories get any po=
litical traction at all? Why are they stuck at less than 40% in the opinion=
 polls? And is there anything David Cameron can do about it in the Shadow C=
abinet re-shuffle tonight?  Michael Crick is on the case.

<br>
<b>SPINVOX</b>
<br>
When the boss of a UK company says "We're going to be the next billion doll=
ar start-up" there are inevitably weary groans from those who remember the =
dotcom boom and bust. But is this technology boom different? Paul Mason has=
 been following the progress of Spinvox, a UK start-up company, to find out=
 what it's really like to raise and spend =C2=A330 million of other people'=
s money.

<b>Joke Fit For an Eleven Year Old</b>
<br>
Regular readers of this email - yes, we know you are out there - may rememb=
er that the current favourite for the Worst Joke of 2007, was sent in by a =
Newsnight member of staff whose identity we are protecting by calling him "=
Peter C." Well, he has struck again:=20
<br>
Two fonts walk into a bar.
<br>
Barman says....
<br>
"Oi! We don't serve your type in here."
<br>
Stop him before he strikes again.
