Hello sm1lies,

Will your design brand the TCCC this year?

Once again, we're featuring an exciting competition for members to create a tournament logo.  A total of $5,000 will be awarded to the top five designers, with the grand prize winner earning $3,000! 

All members have the opportunity to put their originality to the test and design a logo that will be used as the base to brand the 2007 TopCoder Collegiate Challenge. That includes our website, t-shirts, program, the stage at the onsite finals, and anywhere else that the TCCC07 logo might be noticed. 

This contest begins at 2:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time (UTC/GMT -4) on Tuesday, July 3, 2007.  The submission deadline for this contest is 2:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time (UTC/GMT -4) on Tuesday, July 10, 2007.

The contest will award cash prizes totaling $5,000.00 to up to five (5) competitors. 

For all of the contest details, check out http://studio.topcoder.com/?module=ViewActiveContests
 
Best of luck to you at the Studio!
