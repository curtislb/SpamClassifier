Using a tool is not exercising a right under the license.  The license
concerns itself only with copying and modification.  (It is not an end
user license agreement.)  Beyond that, I agree with MJ's analysis, but
I think the point I raised is an important additional one.

All free licenses, and especially all copyleft licenses, require the
waiver of certain legal rights (such as the right to sue for copyright
infringement).  The requirement in copyleft to provide source code can
also be seen as a fee--in fact, this has been cited as a reason for
considering the GPLv2 valid, enforcible and non- discriminatory with
respect to anti-trust law.  If waving legal rights is a problem, we
have no licenses left.  If something that merely *can* "be seen as a
fee" is a problem, then all copylefts are non-free.

Are you talking about the missing "when started running...in the most
ordinary way"?  That was highly ambiguous; this has the advantage of
being clear and direct, and I can't think of any circumstances where
it could actually be considered worse.  I actually think the new
wording is a great improvement, as it closes a highly ambiguous
loophole (the worst kind).

Um, GPLv2 has basically the same requirement: "If the modified program
normally read commands interactively when run, you must cause it...to
print or display an announcement...."  The *only* exception listed is
"if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such
an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to
print an announcement."  The only difference I see is the removal of
"normally", which, like "the most ordinary way" is rather ambiguous.

I'm sorry, but I really don't see how this is a freeness issue *if* we
consider the GPLv2 to be a free license.  The difference between these
requirements is *so* small that I don't see how anyone could accept
the one and reject the other.
