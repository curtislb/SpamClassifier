Hiya,
    Spie, when I tried to apply Speakup patches to the kernel 2.6.17 I downloaded from Slackware, I got a couple of messages about hunk rejections.  They occured in keyboard.c and vt.c.  I was wondering if these were well-understood problems with the patch, or are just a sign that I do indeed need to use 2.6.21.5 or something like that without relying on a Slackware package?
Thanks,
Zack.
