The grep command uses grep's regular expressions, but Perl uses Perl's
regular expressions. Alas, everybody's regular expressions are
different. Perl's are usually better, of course. But the syntax is
always different.

I hope that this is _supposed_ to be a quick-and-dirty program. This
works, although it's slower than using a filehandle would be, and it
probably uses more memory. Although if you're using the tilde to open
a file in the user's home directory, well, that's maybe the best way
to do it.

I think in Perl that pattern might be this:

  /\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}/

But do you really want to match 999.999.999.999? You don't have to.
Have you heard of Regexp::Common? Regexp::Common::net seems to have
what you want.

    /^$RE{net}{IPv4}$/

    http://search.cpan.org/~abigail/Regexp-Common-2.120/lib/Regexp/Common.pm
    http://search.cpan.org/dist/Regexp-Common/lib/Regexp/Common/net.pm

Even if you don't want to install the module to get just one pattern,
you could use the pattern that it supplies, which is sure to be at
least as good as anything you would write on your own.

Good luck with it!
