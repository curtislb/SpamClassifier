This is a good point. Mostly, stuff costs what it costs. But there is a 
thread going on on the jaws list right now about Freedom Scientific becoming 
arrogant because jaws is "institutionalized".  Once you've purchased jaws, 
it is very difficult to move to a competitor because it requires another 
huge outlay of cash and time.

For years, I have been wanting to switch to Window-Eyes when I'm working 
with Windows. But I haven't even asked the University to buy Window-eyes 
because I know it would be opening a can of worms. The University bought 
Jaws originally on my recommendation. But now it's on the lab machines and I 
can't ask them to switch to something else. Also, I would have to learn how 
to use Window-eyes and at least for a while, I'd be less productive. I'd 
have to provide justification for that as well.

My current plan is to switch to either orca or VoiceOver as soon as either 
one of those tools is ready for prime time. I'll either buy a Mac for home 
or  set up a PC with orca at home and learn the new screen reader that way.
