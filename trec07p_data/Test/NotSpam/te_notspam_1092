						<b>Car Bomb</b>
<br>

<br>
Who was trying to blow up central London - and why?
<br>

<br>
Tonight we bring you all the very latest on the bid to target the capital w=
ith a car bomb. The details we have are quite unnerving. A vehicle packed w=
ith explosives that might never have been noticed had not an ambulance crew=
 been called to the scene for a completely unrelated matter. Twelve hours o=
n - all we're being told is that the device was potentially viable and coul=
d have caused carnage.=20
<br>

<br>
But do security services know more about this operation than they're lettin=
g on to us? We hope to talk to those at the Home Office later.=20
<br>

<br>
Those at the Home Office of course have only been in the job twenty four ho=
urs. Indeed some of them appeared - disarmingly - in news conferences today=
 before they had even technically been announced. A former top police chief=
 will be advising Zombie Brown on international security issues, a former F=
irst Sea Lord will be Home Office Minister for Security.=20
<br>

<br>
The new PM did promise a government of 'all the talents' but what do his lo=
ng suffering Labour MPs - who didn't make the cabinet - make of all this pa=
rachuting? Michael Crick is on the case and we'll be talking to our politic=
al panel to give us their take on an extraordinary week in British politics=
.=20
<br>

<br>
<b>Smoking Ban</b>
<br>

<br>
And with only two days to go before the smoking ban comes into force in Eng=
land, we ask if the tobacco companies themselves are worried about falling =
revenues. Experience of the Irish ban suggests they still know exactly who =
to target and how to keep smoking numbers up. So how do they do it?=20=20=

						PRESENTED BY KIRSTY WARK

=09=09=09=09=09
					On Review tonight, it's Damon Albarn, Lou Reed, Mark E Smith, Johnny V=
egas, Stewart Lee, and ... Shrek on a special edition of the programme.
<br>

<br>
We're live from the brand new Manchester International Festival, and I'll b=
e joined by Paul Morley, Miranda Sawyer and John Harris for an extended edi=
tion of the programme at The Lowry Centre over the water in Salford.
<br>
=20
<br>
<B>MONKEY: JOURNEY TO THE WEST</B>
<br>

<br>
This will be a biennial Festival and its big sell is as a festival of "glob=
al premieres", with 25 new works commissioned, and commissions come no bigg=
er than the spectacle that opened the festival last night.
<br>

<br>
Monkey: Journey to the West, is a circus opera based on the most famous of =
the Chinese myth cycles, the fable of the monkey king. The book was banned =
during the Cultural Revolution, but was known to TV audiences here during t=
he 70s and 80s. Now it's been reinvented by the creative combo of Damon Alb=
arn, composing, Jamie Hewlett, designing, and the towering talent of the Ch=
inese opera director Chen Shi- Zheng adapting and directing. A troupe of Ch=
inese singers, dancers, acrobats and contortionists take to the stage, with=
 an orchestra that reads like the United Nations. I'll be taking to Damon, =
Jamie and Shi-Zheng=20
<br>
=20
<br>
<b>INTERIORS</b>
<br>

<br>
At six o'clock tonight Paul, Miranda, John and I will be picked up from a b=
us stop in Manchester and taken to a secret location, a house somewhere in =
the suburbs. There, along with 16 other members of "the audience" we will b=
ecome part of "Interiors" the new site specific play devised by Johnny Vega=
s and Stewart Lee.=20
<br>

<br>
There we will meet Geoffrey Parkin, who is hoping to sell his home to fund =
his relocation to Montenegro. Intrigued? We are. Meanwhile, Johnny Vegas re=
veals his secret side to Newsnight Review.
<br>
=20
<br>
<b>PERVERTED BY LANGUAGE</b>
<br>

<br>
The Fall are part of Manchester's DNA, and Perverted by Language is a new b=
ook of short stories inspired by Fall song titles. There are contributions =
by Michel Faber, Stewart Lee and Stav Sheraz amongst the 23 authors. Newsni=
ght's culture correspondent Steve Smith spoke to Mark E Smith about Manches=
ter fame and this new fiction.
<br>
=20
<br>
<b>LOU REED</b>
<br>

<br>
Lou Reed is also in town to perform the British premiere of his dark drug i=
nfested narrative album Berlin - the story of the desperate downward spiral=
 of a lowlife couple, Caroline and Jim. Originally recorded in London with =
great musicians including Stevie Winwood and Jack Bruce - we don't yet know=
 who'll be on stage with him tonight. He'll perform a track for Newsnight R=
eview.
<br>

<br>
<B>SHREK THE THIRD</B>
<br>

<br>
And from the demimonde of Lou Reed we are transported into the realm of Shr=
ek and Fiona - no sooner have they embarked on wedded bliss than the frog k=
ing croaks it, naming Shrek as his reluctant heir AND Fiona's piling on the=
 pressure for the patter of tiny claws.=20
<br>

<br>
Shrek's in a state and he has to find Artie - Fiona's long lost cousin - an=
d persuade him to take the throne in his place. Hence Justin Timberlake joi=
ns the Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, Mike Myers, Rupert Everett gang in Shrek=
 The Third.
<br>
=20
<br>
Do join us tonight for the Manchester International Festival special, from =
the Lowry Centre in Salford.=20
