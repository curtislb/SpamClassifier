   Firstly, there are some clearups in <clearups.patch>, I think they're
   self-explanatory.

Thank you; applied as r19529.

   Secondly, I discovered that when you're using -D80, Parrot_free_context
   prints out the name of the 'sub' that the context was made for . . .

   I got a segfault for it, but my test case is too large to attach and I
   think it will be hard to get the size down. It isn't very legible anyway.

You should never be able to make PIR segfault; I will look into this.
If you wouldn't mind sending your test case, that might save me some
trouble.

   To solve this we can omit printing the sub name in Parrot_free_context.
   A patch that does this is in <context.patch>. Using -D80 does become
   less legible, but I think we prefer more correct behavior.

   Thanks,

It is really useful to print the sub name, especially when there are
lots of contexts flying around.  (For the record, I'm the one who
changed it to do so.)  The 0xdeadbeef test was trying to work around
subs that were prematurely garbage-collected; I will try to fix this
first.
