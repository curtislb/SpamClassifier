This may be unnecessary, but if anyone needs help with stylistic parts
of the documentation (I can cross-check for accuracy) for a target
audience (i.e., is it documentation for beginners, or those already
familiar with Perl5? Is it aimed toward other programmers who are
switching languages or using Perl exclusively, or is it aimed toward
those with minimal experience who are used to markup languages and
perhaps introductory C or something?)

Just thought I'd volunteer for the effort, if needed.
