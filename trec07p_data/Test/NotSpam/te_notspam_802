>The National Health Insurance Corporation of South Korea invited
>CPATH Co-Directors Ellen Shaffer and Joe Brenner to visit early in
>June and discuss our views on KORUS FTA's implications for access to
>affordable drugs, tobacco control and the encroachment of
>privatized, for- profit health care.  We found health advocates
>deeply concerned that KORUS will send the health care system veering
>off in just the wrong direction at just the wrong time.
>
>Although U.S. trade officials are attempting to ease threats to
>affordable drugs in poor countries like Peru, they have contended
>that in thriving economies like Korea's the market for medicines is
>fair game.  CPATH counters that trade agreements should not
>jeopardize public health, and rather should remedy the serious
>problems of many in advanced economies like Korea and the U.S. who
>can't afford life-saving medicines.
