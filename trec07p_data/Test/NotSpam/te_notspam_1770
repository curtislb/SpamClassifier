...but with 500 variables and only 20 'entities' (observations) you will
have 481 PCs with dead zero eigenvalues.  How small is 'smaller' and how
many is "a few"?

Everyone who has responded to this seems to accept the idea that PCA is
the way to go here, but that is not clear to me at all.  There is a
2-sample structure in the 20 observations that you have.  If you simply
ignore that in doing your PCA you are making strong assumptions about
sampling that would seem to me unlikely to be met.  If you allow for the
structure and project orthogonal to it then you are probably throwing
the baby out with the bathwater - you want to choose variables which
maximise separation between the 2 samples (and now you are up to 482
zero principal variances, if that matters...).

I think this problem probably needs a bit of a re-think.  Some variant
on singular LDA, for example, may be a more useful way to think about
it.

What is meant by "last few PCs"?
