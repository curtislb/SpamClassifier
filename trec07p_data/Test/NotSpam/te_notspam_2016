Dustin,
This is pretty OS-specific, and you haven't said what device manageryou want to interact with. And are you sure you want to scriptwhichever application you're using instead of just handling the systemcalls directly? There are Perl for your OS's system calls on CPAN,though. Just head over there and do a search for whichever OS and/ordevice you're interested in.
Device::USB, for instance, will give you access to USB devices throughlibsub on most *ix systems.
HTH,
