First, can I make a jump that far? Second, when I untar'd the
opt-samba-3.0.25a-AIX.tar I only got one .bff file. Is this all there
is? Seems to me to be a big jump. Does 25a have all of the changes
needed between 10 and 25a? I've never installed samba and don't know
much about it. Do I need to remove 3.0.10 first. I didn't see that on
the instructions. I'm all set to install on a test box, but, I'm afraid
to pull the trigger. 
 
Thanks for your help,
