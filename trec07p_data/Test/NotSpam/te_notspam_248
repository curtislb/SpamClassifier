Schwab's statement from
http://www.ustr.gov/Document_Library/Press_Releases/2007/June/Schwab_stateme
nt_on_amendments_to_US-Peru_Trade_Promotion_Agreement.html:
“I am pleased to announce that we have reached an agreement with the
Government of Peru on amendments to the U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement.
These legally binding amendments to the agreement's provisions on labor, the
environment, and other matters reflect the bipartisan agreement on trade
between the Administration and Congressional leadership reached on May 10.
. . .
We are also in consultations with the Governments of Colombia, Panama and
Korea regarding similar provisions."
