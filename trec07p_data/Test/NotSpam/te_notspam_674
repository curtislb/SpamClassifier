Claim that ?1m El Cid sword is a forgery provokes a duel of words 
By Elizabeth Nash in Madrid 
Published: 13 June 2007 
The modern-day clash over a sword that once belonged to Spain's medieval hero El Cid may become as legendary as the warrior's fighting skills. 

Authorities in the knight's home region recently snapped up La Tizona - not just a weapon, but a potent national symbol - from a Spanish aristocrat for a steely ?1.6m (?1m), planning to put it on show next to El Cid's tomb in Burgos cathedral.

But the government has slashed their plans to ribbons, branding the sabre a stylish fake. The Culture Ministry had already been offered the so-called historic relic, it said, but after commissioning multiple scientific studies it was found to be a fraud, worth no more than ?300,000.

The new owners are standing firm, however. "The ministry is just jealous because we bought it and they didn't. Historical tradition has always attributed this sword to El Cid," authorities in the Castilla Leon region of northern Spain said. The title El Cid (Andalus Arabic for chief, or leader) was given to Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar (1043-1099). His battles against Moorish occupiers prompted Spanish Catholics to adopt him as a national figurehead.

Every Spanish child learns of El Cid's bizarre final confrontation, when Catholic soldiers dragged the swordsman from his deathbed, propped him on his horse, strapped La Tizona to his side, and displayed him to the enemy. The mere sight of the never-defeated warrior prompted the Moors to flee in terror.

Spain's National Heritage, Madrid's Archaeological Museum and the Royal Academy of History have all given the sword the thumbs down, with one specialist dating it from the 15th or 16th century.

The aristocrat who sold the sword, Jose Ramon Suarez de Otero, Marquis of Falces, is livid. "La Tizona has been in my family since the 1400s, and it pains me that political interests are denigrating this sword, symbol of our history," he fumed.

Discretion required to protect fossil sites
Sunday, June 24, 2007

By Don Hopey, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette

Directions to the Allen L. Cook Spring Creek Preserve and prospecting
locations within it are somewhat vague. 

This is done on purpose because of the real risk of fossil theft.

Edward McCord, University of Pittsburgh Honors College Program director and
preserve coordinator, asked that specific information about routes, geologic
locations and paleontological sites not be used. 

"Some articles about the preserve have termed it the 'best since Como
Bluff,' and that may have overblown it, but there have been historic
instances of people raiding dinosaur digs and we are concerned," said
Mandela Lyon, a paleobiologist and co-instructor for this summer's
University of Pittsburgh field course.

Como Bluff is the nearby fossil-rich site north of Medicine Bow, Wyo. that
between the 1860s and 1890s yielded such finds as the Diplodocus carnegii,
bones better known today as the Carnegie Museum of Natural History's
"Dippy." 

Fossil smuggling from Russia, China and Australia is widespread. Because of
the likelihood of theft, important finds in Australia are protected and
often kept secret. One such middle of the night theft involved the use of
jackhammers to take a stegosaurus footprint. 

Between 1995 and 1998, the National Park Service identified 721 documented
incidents of paleontological resource theft or vandalism, many involving
multiple specimens. The number of thefts has risen as prices have gone up.

In 1991, an Allosaurus skeleton was stolen from federal Bureau of Land
Management land southeast of Fremont Junction, Utah and sold to a Japanese
buyer for $400,000. A BLM official said of the theft, "Because it was
crudely collected, we have lost any chance to study the way the skeleton lay
in the ground, how it was buried, what happened to it after death, and other
plants or animals that may have been buried with it. We have lost a
priceless piece of America's natural heritage." 

"We're not trying to keep this a secret or be too guarded, but we are trying
to preserve material for future educational and research purposes," Ms. Lyon
said. "We're just being cautious."
