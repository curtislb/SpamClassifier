      The 'weights' argument on 'lm' is assumed to identify a vector of 
the same length as the response, giving numbers that are inversely 
proportional to the variance for each observation. 

      However, 'lm' provides no capability to estimate weights.  If you 
want to do that, the varFunc capabilities in the 'nlme' package is the 
best tool I know for that purpose. 

      If someone thinks there are better tools available for estimating 
heterscedasticity, I hope s/he will enlighten us both. 

      Hope this helps.
