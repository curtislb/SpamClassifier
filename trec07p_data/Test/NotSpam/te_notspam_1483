My case was:

Q: Could this requirement be interpreted more liberally?
A: I wish it could, but I am afraid it cannot...  :-(

Frankly speaking, it seems more similar to your first example, than to
your second one...

I mean: we were *not* talking about particular facts.  Iain Nicol was
*not* telling me that he modified a GPLv3'd work and got sued by
upstream because his newly implemented interactive interface does not
display Appropriate Legal Notices.
I did *not* suggest a particular course of action.  I did *not* answer
"the requirement cannot be interpreted more liberally, but you can
instead tell the judge that ..."

What we were doing was discussing about possible interpretations of a
clause in a just-published license...

Is "I am afraid it cannot" a definite answer?
It does not even seem to express certainty...

I am not an English native speaker, so I could be wrong about what
sounds as a definite answer to an English mothertongue's ear.
Should I begin to add IANAENS, to the list of disclaimers?
