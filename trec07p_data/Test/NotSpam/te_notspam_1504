"Border-line" implies that it could go either direction.  This is not true.
Regardless of how you feel about this clause, the GPLv2 is recognized as a
free license under the DFSG.

It is not a qualitative change.  I see no grounds for saying that it's worse
than the existing clause.

The 4-clause BSD is also not "close to failing the DFSG".  It's fair to
point out that licenses with such clauses give less freedom to the user than
licenses without, but that does not mean they are "close to failing".  They
are clearly permitted, and I don't think it's useful to talk about
"proximity" to the line of DFSGness, because it's always possible to make
thinner and thinner slices.  We can cite many examples of clauses that we
consider non-free because they take more freedom from the user, and that's a
useful exercise to indicate which are free and which are not; but to call
something "close to non-free" is just an expression of your dislike for it,
masquerading as an objective judgement.

There is no qualitative difference between the two clauses.  We have *never*
treated quantitative differences between licenses as relevant to freeness.
Would you claim that the GPLv2's "make the source available for three years"
requirement is ok, but a clause saying "make the source available for six
years" is not?  If not, then why claim that "display a copyright notice if
you create a CLI" is ok, but "display a copyright notice if you create a
GUI" is not?

I challenge you to offer a reasonable bright line test by which we would say
the GPLv2 clause is free and the GPLv3 clause is non-free.  I believe you
will fail.

Yes, let's.  Preferably others who are actually Debian developers, instead
of non-DDs who discourage developer participation on debian-legal through
the numerical superiority of their posts advancing outlandish
interpretations of the DFSG that are untempered by such trifles as reality.

It talks about the license *of a Debian component*.  A patent license is not
a license of a Debian component, it's a license to third-party "intellectual
property".

No, it does not.  Just as cryptographic works that we couldn't distribute
from inside the US were never deemed "non-free", works that are subject to
third-party patents should not be.  They are not legally distributable, or
they are a danger to our users (and therefore distributing them may be
contrary to the social contract), but these are factors *external* to the
work in question.
