No. This is no more true than to say that, because the GPL, BSD, and
Artistic licenses accompany software in Debian, that those licenses
apply to all of that software.

The only thing you've clearly done is distribute a license text and a
CD. The license text doesn't apply as the terms for the software on
the CD unless and until the copyright holder explicitly declares so in
a grant of license unabiguously on that particular software.

In that case, yes, I agree that the copyright holder has explicitly
chosen to renounce any additional restrictions beyond those in the
GPLv3 terms.
