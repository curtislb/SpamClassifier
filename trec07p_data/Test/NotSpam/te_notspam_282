I first use what packages Slackware has available and if I want
something Slack doesn't have available, then I compile from sources
and where possible, I use something like checkinstall to help in
building a slackware compatible package.  One thing I like about
packages - even the ones I build is I can compile something like
mplayer on my fast machine and then just drop in the package on my
slower laptop and just install it.  Another advantage to packages -
once built either by myself or from slackware distro, is it is much
easier to remove all components.  Some tarballs are complex enough
that it is nearly impossible to find all the pieces to be removed.
This is especially important when you want to upgrade.

I'm able to try out new Linux distributions on the fly and as I become interested in them.  Today I tried out Slackware 11.0, and I really like it so far.  The only thing I have to get used to is the amount that comes preinstalled and the amount that isn't available.  There are far fewer packages in the Slackware repositories than in, say, the Gentoo Portage system or Debian's package databases.  But I don't know if this is a bad thing or not.
