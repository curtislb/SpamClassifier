I just spent about an hour trying to figure out how the files
in runtime/parrot/library/ are automatically compiled into .pbc files
when Parrot is built.  It turns out that the list of files
is computed from the MANIFEST, and I was searching through
files in the config/ subdirectory (where most other configuration-like
items tend to be placed).

Is MANIFEST the correct file for determining which .pir files
should automatically be converted to .pbc ?

And if it is (or even if it isn't but we decide to keep it
this way for some time), could/should there be a note in the
generated root Makefile that indicates that GEN_LIBRARY is
being generated from entries in the MANIFEST?

Thanks,

Pm
