Hi folks.

I've got the following script which works until it reaches the end of the 
input file. It processes the last line and prints out the contents, but then 
the program terminates with the unhelpful error:

Manufacturers Ref.:     L53522  Status: 5290    (Work not pulled)
Comments:       ''


 at ../bin/walon4 line 25

Line 25 is the last print statement within the while loop. If I delete that 
line and re-run the script it then complains about line 24. Either way, the 
program terminates before printing 'Hello World'

Anyone got any ideas?

#!/usr/bin/perl -w

use Tie::Handle::CSV;
my $csv_fh = Tie::Handle::CSV->new($ARGV[0], header => 1);
