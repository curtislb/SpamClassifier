CNN Tonight: A Rare Interview with Colin Powell!

Former Secretary of State Colin Powell has hardly
spoken since stepping down nearly three years ago.
Now, a rare sit-down with Colin Powell on America,
Iraq, Vice President Cheney, Guantanamo and more.

Plus, his wife Alma joins him on their
urgent mission to safeguard America’s
most precious resource – its children.
Colin Powell for the hour!

Tonight only on Larry King Live!
