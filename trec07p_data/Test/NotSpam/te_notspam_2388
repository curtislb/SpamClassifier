Thanks for the help. The while loop move makes sense! I knew this looked silly, but with the rest of the code, I am looping in many arrays. In this section I am only working with the first indice (the .vmx one).

Is it actually incorrect to run: stop_it(@DNS); aside from maybe looking strange?

So the `/usr/bin/vmware-cmd \"$_[0]\" gettoolslastactive -q`; is correct where the var gets inserted?

Thanks!

The while belongs inside of the if like this:

               if ($state == 'on') {
                               'vmware-cmd $_[0] stop soft';
                               my $tools = `/usr/bin/vmware-cmd
\"$_[0]\" gettoolslastactive -q`;
                               chomp($tools);

                               while ($tools == 1) {
                                              sleep 30;
                                              $tools =
`/usr/bin/vmware-cmd \"$_[0]\" gettoolslastactive -q`;
                                              chomp($tools);
                              }
               }

In your example $_[0] is
"/vmfs/volumes/467f06a5-7d59c067-35cb-0007e9153886/Web & DNS (Win2003
Std x32)/Web & DNS (Win2003 Std x32).vmx"

If you want to perform stop_it on or with many values you will need to
put a loop outside or inside the sub.  Given the way your code is
currently written this should work:

stop_it($_) for @DNS;
