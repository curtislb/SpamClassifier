I don't. In all the path-based requests, I use split_ntfs_stream_name  
to figure out the path and the stream name. If the path contains a  
colon, then matching the stream name to an extended attribute (or  
whatever) will fail, and the corresponding open will fail.

Another weakness (though not intrinsic) of my approach is that when I  
have a stream mapped to an extended attribute, I hold a file  
descriptor open on the file that hosts the extended attribute. You  
kinda have to do this because you can't let the file disappear while  
the stream is open. On the other hand, doing this will really mess  
with  posix locks.
