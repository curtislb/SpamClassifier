 Brazil gets cut-price Aids drug
   By Gary Duffy
BBC News, Sao Paulo
 * Brazil has accepted an offer from a manufacturer of an important
anti-Aids drug to cut its price by around 30%. *

The deal with Abbott over its drug Kaletra was hailed by Brazil's health
minister as an example to other companies around the world.

In May, it broke the patent on another Aids drug and now imports a cheaper
generic version from India.

Drug companies are increasingly sensitive about the willingness of
developing nations to break patents.

Abbott says it is also offering to cut prices for 45 middle and lower-income
developing nations.

* Policy praised *

The move will save Brazil around $10m (£4.95m) a year.

Brazil did this for the first time earlier this year, and is now importing
cheaper generic versions of the drug Efavirenz from India.

Thailand has also bypassed a number of patents as well.

However on this occasion, an agreement was reached, a development that was
welcomed by Health Minister Jose Gomez Temporao.

He said it would be very promising if other companies were to follow the
example of Abbott Laboratories.

Brazil has been widely praised for its approach to combating HIV and Aids,
which includes providing free drugs to patients.

The policy is thought to have cut Aids-related deaths by half, while
producing huge savings in hospital costs, our correspondent says.
